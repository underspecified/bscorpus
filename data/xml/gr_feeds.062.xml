And remember how the Democrats tried to compromise, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/19/breaking-republicans-derail-the-competes-act/"&gt;removing almost $40 billion of the funding from the bill&lt;/a&gt;, but Republicans &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; stonewalled? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/29/breaking-third-times-a-charm-congress-passes-science-act/"&gt;After the Democrats managed to pass the bill despite this&lt;/a&gt;, guess what the honorable Ralph Hall had to say. Go on. Guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you guess &lt;a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/06/dems-thwart-gop-plan-to-kill-science-jobs-bill-with-porn.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I am disappointed that my Democratic colleagues resorted to using a procedural tactic to defeat Republican changes that would have saved over $40 billion and restored the original COMPETES priority of basic research,&amp;quot; science committee ranking member Ralph Hall said in a press release after the vote. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, Representative Hall. It wasn’t enough for you to accuse the Democrats of blatant and transparent partisan parliamentary tactics when they were responding to &lt;em&gt;your very own&lt;/em&gt; blatant and transparent partisan parliamentary tactics, was it? So you went ahead and blamed them for not saving the $40 billion &lt;em&gt;that they offered to cut to make you happy in the first place&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of taking that compromise, you slammed the door in their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, that wacky, wacky Representative Hall. Hyperpartisan hypocritical hackery doesn’t look good on &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, sir. I sometimes think the Emperor would be better off just coming out and saying he’s naked, rather than trying to sell us on his new clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Myers,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Over the last several years I have been "converting" from a once very strong evangelical faith to atheism.  It was a long road and involved many different facets, one of which was a steady tide of atheist reason and thought I received online.  And my main source, well none other then you, Dr. Myers.  My first movement towards rationality came when I started researching evolution and what do you know, it was true.  While I was still an evangelical, I started tracking the creation and evolution controversy, which often through a link landed me on you blog as you are very prominent in the discussion.  I would read a post about evolution and learn something new and then stay awhile and read another post hear or there and cringe and you tore into my religion.  I was threatened by you, most prominently because I often had no good answers for your criticisms.  I won't write out my entire deconversion story but I'll summarize you're role in that over the last several years I have spent more and more time on your site, reading and thinking.  You are now the only blog I follow and I read everything your write.  I write this note as encouragement that your persistent defense of rationality and reason does make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, how do you come by all these different stories to comment on?  Are people sending you links of things they might think you will find interesting?  I have long suspected that most of the polls you have us trash are being sent to you by readers who happen to stumble upon them as they travel around the web, that or you have developed you own poll search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s good news, and I should mention that I get half a dozen messages like this a week — they&amp;#39;re more common than death threats, but not quite as frequent as the crazies. It&amp;#39;s also fairly typical (not to diminish the writer&amp;#39;s clear commitment to reason) in that I don&amp;#39;t get stories about epiphanies and &amp;#39;road to Damascus&amp;#39; deconversions, and I&amp;#39;m glad of it, because that&amp;#39;s not how one should come to atheism. It&amp;#39;s usually a long, difficult process of thinking for yourself … and I can&amp;#39;t honestly take credit for it, as if I were some sort of evangelical missionary for godlessness, because all I do is provoke and, with luck, jump-start some critical thinking. Like the writer above, sometimes it works because I get someone angry and they go off to prove me wrong, and when they actually look at the evidence, reason unfolds slowly and painfully in their cranium, puncturing old preconceptions with its pointy bits and sharp edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer his question, yes, I get a flood of email every single day with hundreds of requests (and sometimes &lt;i&gt;demands&lt;/i&gt;) to post something about X, Y, and Z. Sometimes I just click randomly into the inbox and throw up something about it; sometimes a story just tickles me. I can't address it all, of course, but it means all I have to do is tap into the collective outrage and humor of the community of readers here, and presto, I've got something to write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/i_get_email_58.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/f02oyP-VOQo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275507778667"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/i_am_so_glad_im_not_the_only_o.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c303ceb5721d1fa5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">I am so glad I'm not the only one</title><published>2010-06-02T18:12:58Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T18:12:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/EQeNrB60g8g/i_am_so_glad_im_not_the_only_o.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/i_am_so_glad_im_not_the_only_o.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're always hearing about these amazing profilers who work to describe the culprits, sight unseen, in serial killer cases. They get highlighted in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silence-Lambs-Hannibal-Lector/dp/0312195265/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1275499018&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297284/"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiler_%28TV_series%29"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, and the media just slurps it up with gullible glee. I&amp;#39;ve always found them unbelievable. The noise they&amp;#39;re making is pure cold-reading, and there&amp;#39;s nothing different between them and psychic detectives — it&amp;#39;s an embarrassment that our law enforcement agencies still use them, along with lie detector tests and handwriting analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was glad to see this &lt;a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2007/2007_11_12_a_profile.html"&gt;critical article from Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/a&gt;, written several years ago. He makes the same argument, that these analyses are pure bunkum. Among many examples, here's one about one of the first profilers, James Brussel, who was touted as incredibly insightful for making so many predictions about a serial bomber in New York in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Brussel didn't really see the Mad Bomber in that pile of pictures and photostats, then. That was an illusion. As the literary scholar Donald Foster pointed out in his 2000 book "Author Unknown," Brussel cleaned up his predictions for his memoirs. He actually told the police to look for the bomber in White Plains, sending the N.Y.P.D.'s bomb unit on a wild goose chase in Westchester County, sifting through local records. Brussel also told the police to look for a man with a facial scar, which Metesky didn't have. He told them to look for a man with a night job, and Metesky had been largely unemployed since leaving Con Edison in 1931. He told them to look for someone between forty and fifty, and Metesky was over fifty. He told them to look for someone who was an "expert in civil or military ordnance" and the closest Metesky came to that was a brief stint in a machine shop. And Brussel, despite what he wrote in his memoir, never said that the Bomber would be a Slav. He actually told the police to look for a man "born and educated in Germany," a prediction so far off the mark that the Mad Bomber himself was moved to object. At the height of the police investigation, when the New York Journal American offered to print any communications from the Mad Bomber, Metesky wrote in huffily to say that "the nearest to my being 'Teutonic' is that my father boarded a liner in Hamburg for passage to this country--about sixty-five years ago."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The true hero of the case wasn't Brussel; it was a woman named Alice Kelly, who had been assigned to go through Con Edison's personnel files. In January, 1957, she ran across an employee complaint from the early nineteen-thirties: a generator wiper at the Hell Gate plant had been knocked down by a backdraft of hot gases. The worker said that he was injured. The company said that he wasn't. And in the flood of angry letters from the ex-employee Kelly spotted a threat--to "take justice in my own hands"--that had appeared in one of the Mad Bomber's letters. The name on the file was George Metesky.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Brussel did not really understand the mind of the Mad Bomber. He seems to have understood only that, if you make a great number of predictions, the ones that were wrong will soon be forgotten, and the ones that turn out to be true will make you famous. The Hedunit is not a triumph of forensic analysis. It's a party trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also cannot abide Sherlock Holmes, in either book or movie form, because it is such hokum. I'm always growling to myself, "Wait, you cannot derive a simple linear chain of inferred causality from a single observation of a phenomenon with many different possible causes and variables! Holmes, you fraud!", and then I end up throwing the book away or turning the television off. Even the latest film version with Robert Downey Jr., which was entertaining because they turned Holmes into a brawling thug, was infuriating whenever Holmes would get into a fight and calmly calculate &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what was going to happen in the next 10 seconds.

People tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and neglecting alternatives. This strategy is not necessarily a bias, but combined with other effects it can reinforce existing beliefs. The biases appear in particular for issues that are emotionally significant (including some personal and political topics) and for established beliefs that shape the individual's expectations. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's granted that we all have this bias, all of us, to certain degrees. It's part of the human condition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking specifically about religious faiths, let me contrast this with &lt;i&gt;The Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/i&gt; (OTF) which calls upon believers to test their own geographically inherited faith with the same level of skepticism they use to test the religious faiths they reject. I argue that adopting this test is the best and probably the only way to overcoming any confirming bias when it comes to one's inherited religious faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is being argued by Professor Randal Rauser that ex-Christians like Dan Barker and others who have written chapters for &lt;i&gt;The Christian Delusion&lt;/i&gt; are basically no different when they argue for non-belief. He sums up a recent post by asking and answering a question: &lt;blockquote&gt;[A]re any of us motivated simply by a burning desire for actual facts, an intense craving to truly fill in the blanks of knowledge? I doubt it. But then if atheists are no better off on this count, neither can we say they are categorically any worse off. And with that, let's all concede that we begin on the same ground, a self-interested desire to know, more or less. &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/blogs/tentativeapologist/2010/06/do-atheists-care-about-truth-on-the-christian-delusion-part-2-01/index.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the first comment after his post SilverBullet wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Critical thinking is specifically about eliminating self interest. Loftus' outsider test of faith is specifically about eliminating self interest. [This comment is the last one on the page--you read them in order from the bottom up]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree. Continue reading upward for the other responses, including mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of my points is that it appears to me confirmation bias is what we do when it comes to beliefs we hold dearly and want to be true. When I was a believer I was infected with it, deeply, as was Dan Barker and others. We wanted it to be true. We had invested a great deal of time and effort into defending our faith. But we were shocked and dismayed that even with this bias our faith was a sham. It was heart-breaking and completely contrary to what we had expected. &lt;b&gt;I have not heard from any former Christian who describes it any other way. We did not want to conclude what we did. We went kicking and screaming into unbelief.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it might be claimed that as atheists we too are infected with a confirmation bias to defend what we have concluded. Okay, since all human beings suffer from this to some extent. &lt;b&gt;But it was emphatically NOT how we arrived at our current positions. We wanted Christianity to be true. We preferred it. We were immersed in it. Our lives were wrapped up in it. We were also extremely bothered and even scared of being wrong, since we did not want to go into everlasting punishment. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testimonies of conversion or deconversion coming from both sides of the fence, whether it's Christians who leave the fold, or atheists who join the fold, have only a limited amount of persuasive weight. The weight of them depends on who it is, how much he or she was immersed in their former views, how many people switch their views from one side to the other, what their stated reasons are for switching, and the consequences that these fence switchers must face in terms of social benefits and eternal threats. As such, I think deconversions away from the fold have much more weight because of each and every one of these factors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take just one of these factors as an example. What does an atheist have to gain if he switches sides and joins the Christian fold? He gains many social benefits and eternal rewards (that's the promise anyway). Now consider what a Christian has to gain if he or she leaves the fold. Apostates face a great deal of social approbation along with the threat of eternal punishment. Under which set of conditions will confirmation bias be more intense for which group of fence switchers? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answer: Deconverts away from the fold, hands down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Listen to what Dan Barker said about leaving the fold:&lt;blockquote&gt;..it was like tearing my whole frame of reality to pieces, ripping to shreds the fabric of meaning and hope, betraying the values of existence...It was like spitting on my mother, or like throwing one of my children out a window. It was sacrilege &lt;/blockquote&gt;Right that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there anything comparable for this when an atheist becomes a Christian? I think not. Not by a long shot. Look at the social benefits for an atheist to convert to Christianity for instance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C.S. Lewis was an atheist who converted to Christianity through a long process, even though he was no fundamentalist. He is such a hero to Christian believers his books still top the charts in the apologetics category over at Amazon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most famous recent atheist who became a deist, Antony Flew, was showered with attention by Christians, parading him around like he was a hero, even helping write his last book which surely will sell more than any other book he's ever written. I wonder what kind of advance they gave him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lee Strobel became a believer to keep his marriage together, and look at him now. He too is a hero among Christians, making more money off his books then he ever dreamed of doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J. Budziszewski is another one who was an atheist-turned-Christian, and his name is also bandied about as a hero. [It seems as though Christians have so few heroes who left atheism that if one switches sides they will be treated as heroes].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Wood is another self-proclaimed atheist who turned Christian and he too touts that as a significant fact. But his conversion came out of juvenile delinquency and serious mental/physical problems, so can his conversion really significantly count when he was not the intellectual atheist that I am?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been asked to come back to the faith as well, with promises of having a large church, a number of speaking engagements, and/or superior books sales when I write about my re-conversion. They would love to parade me around as a hero. [The problem here is that I cannot answer my own arguments expressed in my books, so the first question they would ask me is to argue with my former self and I couldn't do it].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what social benefits await a Christian who leaves the fold for atheism in comparison?

But rather than break with his credulous worldview - a worldview that once prompted Mr. Tredinnick to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/news/Leicestershire-MP-repays-163-755-claimed-expenses-astrology-software/article-1715731-detail/article.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;claim for software that claims to show a link between astrology and healthcare on expenses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt; - the Leicestershire MP appears to have stepped up his pro-woo campaigning, and in doing so takes a sideswipe at his Parliamentary nemesis, former Oxford West and Abingdon MP Dr. Evan Harris.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;In his ePolitix piece, Tredinnick insists that the enduring popularity of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:18px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;healthcare model that allows doctors to refer to other therapists such as herbalists, acupuncturists, homeopaths and aromatherapists&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; equiv=&amp;quot;content-type&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;is reason enough to sanction State-funded 'integrated healthcare,' by which one assumes Tredinnick means the integration of the likes of these disciplines into routine NHS treatment. Fine, say I - as long as these disciplines can prove, to the same standards expected of all so-called conventional medicine, that they are effective, that they have some discernible impact on patients' health - beyond the placebo effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;In singling out Dr. Harris for criticism, Tredinnick raises an interesting issue whilst at the same time exposing his own twisted logic; the interesting issue being that Harris' defeat leaves Parliament desperately short of rationalist, scientific thinking (&lt;a href="http://www.libdemvoice.org/dr-julian-huppert-mps-maiden-speech-19708.html"&gt;honourable exceptions aside...)&lt;/a&gt;; his mention of EDM 908 reminds us of quite how flawed his thinking on alternative medicine really is, as &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/03/mp-david-tredinnick-is-wrong-about-the-homeopathy-report.html"&gt;Le Canard Noir eloquently wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;At a time when the public purse is under such strain, we need lawmakers who are willing and able to recognise that an evidence-based approach is indispensable, that sound values must underpin our public discourse. These are values that were fought for hundreds of years ago as part of the Enlightenment - unless the legislature adopts a more credible stance on such issues as taxpayer subsidies for magical ointments and tinctures, there is a risk that the New Coalition will go the way of the Old Guard - sliding down the scale of legitimacy into farce, with MPs such as David Tredinnick leading us down the path to endarkenment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/488262047686109051-4310500533044706082?l=teekblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275503825998"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=180706">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2ff576d1b97730f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Blisstree giveaway"/><category term="giveaway"/><category term="health giveaways"/><category term="prizes &amp; giveaways"/><title type="html">This week’s sweet giveaway pairs two of our all-time favorite</title><published>2010-06-02T18:23:50Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T18:23:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/180706/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week’s sweet &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/giveaway/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=giveaway&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;giveaway&lt;/a&gt; pairs two of our all-time favorite foods:&lt;/strong&gt; instant oatmeal and dark chocolate.

In real life, that just means a witty comeback, but “&lt;a href="http://www.heybabygame.com/info.php"&gt;Hey Baby&lt;/a&gt;,” a new first-person shooter game, allows ladies to release their pent up anger on catcallers – &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey Baby” allows players to shoot men if they don’t appreciate their advances, and is meant purely for women to take out their aggression on total creeps (virtually, not literally). While many think that violent video games are never the answer, some  women will undoubtedly enjoy the catharsis. And as &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/life/video_games/index.html?story=/mwt/broadsheet/2010/06/02/video_game_harassment"&gt;Salon.com&lt;/a&gt; points out, with all the games out there that degrade women (Grand Theft Auto, anyone?), maybe it’s not such a bad thing for us to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Does this game sound too realistic and violent, or is it a harmless release for fed-up women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Blisstree told you about the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/pregnancy-and-depression-antidepressants-linked-to-miscarriage/"&gt;increased risk of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; for women who take antidepressants. We wondered if there was a better option for expectant mothers who cope with anxiety or depression. And it turns out that some people may be able to get the results that medication produces through therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey was performed with 1,544 people who had sought professional help for anxiety or depression between January 2006 and April 2009. After analyzing the data, researchers found that people who stuck with therapy for seven weeks could get results that were as effective as taking medication. This is great news for people looking to avoid prescription drugs, either because of possible risks or negative side effects. However, talk therapy alone may only be a solution for those who have patience and follow-through (not to mention good mental &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/health/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=health&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; benefits), since it can take at least seven weeks to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/feel/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=feel&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;feel&lt;/a&gt; results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;As there are no atheists in foxholes, it turns out there are no small-government disciples in massive oil spills.&lt;/strong&gt; No, with BP oil soaking the sands of his coastline, Jindal turned righteously to that big, sometimes bloated, often intrusive federal government, and asked for help. He said: Send money, send resources.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it purposely anti-atheist?  I didn’t think so.  Just an honest mistake — using an unfortunately common cliché that really should be done away with altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected an apology or retraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how Pitts responded to people who wrote him about this issue (via his assistant):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think you’re reading a little more into that offhand comment than I ever intended to pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have no doubt there are many principled atheists who stick to their non-belief even in the face of great trial and danger, I also know there are those who do not. Maybe I should’ve said, “there are few atheists in foxholes.” Maybe that’s what I’ll do in the future. But again, I was only using a familiar old saying to draw what I regarded as a useful parallel and intended no deeper meaning. I apologize to you and any other offended atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours Truly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard Pitts, Jr.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get that he was using a common phrase as a literary device and he wasn’t actually making the case that there were no atheists in foxholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not happy with the “apology.”  Pitts doesn’t get how the phrase is a slap in the face to atheists who honorably serve our country and how we’re actively trying to change that stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you have said this, but there are other offensive stereotypes that no columnist would use because of how untrue and hurtful they are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitts never would’ve written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just as Jews have all the money, BP has all the responsibility of fixing their mess.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has no problem, though, using a phrase that is offensive to atheists.  And he doesn’t get why we find it hurtful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s disappointing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, you’ve heard of Cassini, and the Mars probes, but there are two very interesting spacecraft making two very interesting encounters in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/06/epoxi.jpg" alt="epoxi" title="epoxi" width="226" height="170"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1) On June 27, NASA’s Deep Impact spacecraft — which sent a chunk of copper smashing into a comet back in 2005, and which has now been repurposed for planetary science  — &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/epoxi20100528.html"&gt;will swing by the Earth&lt;/a&gt;, using our planet’s gravity to change its direction and speed. DI &lt;a href="http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/flybys.shtml"&gt;will pass&lt;/a&gt; at a distance of just 37,000 km (23,000 miles)! That’s around the same height above the surface as geosynchronous (i.e. weather and communication) satellites. This maneuver will send the little spacecraft on its way &lt;a href="http://epoxi.umd.edu/3gallery/graphics/EPOXI_Mission_H2_Timeline-lg.jpg"&gt;to an encounter&lt;/a&gt; with the comet Hartley 2 in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/11/rosetta.jpg" alt="rosetta" title="rosetta" width="250" height="181"&gt;2) The European Space Agency’s amazing Rosetta spacecraft &lt;a href="http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/5/1169"&gt;will fly by&lt;/a&gt; the asteroid 21 Lutetia on July 10. The asteroid is about 95 km across (60 miles), and the flyby distance will be about 3200 km (2000 miles). That’s pretty close, certainly near enough to provide some nice images of the rock. In 2008, Rosetta &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/06/in-the-sky-with-diamonds/"&gt;passed the smaller asteroid 2867 Steins&lt;/a&gt; and returned nice images, and in 2009 swung by the Earth, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/11/12/rosetta-takes-some-home-pictures/"&gt;sending back an image&lt;/a&gt; so heart-achingly beautiful I chose it as one of my Top Ten images of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosetta’s primary mission is taking it to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, where it will drop an actual honest-to-FSM lander on the comet’s surface! This is a tremendously exciting mission, and I can’t wait to see what new wonders it will send us.&lt;/p&gt;

They sponsor a number of activities including lectures, education, conferences, and research.  I’ve given talks at the local branch, and it’s a great thrill to meet with such an engaged and enthusiastic audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’re in a bit of trouble.  As a non-profit, they rely on donations, and their major donor seems to have &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/fundraising_appeal/"&gt;mysteriously disappeared&lt;/a&gt;.  About $800,000 of their annual operating budget is suddenly gone.&lt;/p&gt;

What&amp;#39;s particualrly cool about this work is that it doesn&amp;#39;t require gigantic accelerators or nuclear explosions to produce a laser-like beam of x-rays-- it&amp;#39;s all done with lasers that fit on a normal-size optical table in an ordinary lab room.

The specific talk I saw was by Margaret Murnane of JILA, who co-leads their ultra-fast laser group, and dealt with a new technique for producing soft-x-rays (~500 eV photons) with ultrafast lasers. We&amp;#39;ll do this as a real quick ResearchBlogging post regarding the PRL on the subject (freely available as publication #8 on their 2009 publications list), in Q&amp;amp;A format:

So, what did they do, again? They used infrared laser pulses whose width was only a few tens of femtoseconds (1 fs = 0.000000000000001 s) to generate x-ray photons by blasting them into a hollow optical fiber filled with noble gas. They put in three millijoules of energy per pulse, and got out x-rays with an energy of 500eV per photon (a bit less than 10-16 joules, so this isn&amp;#39;t violating conservation of energy, even though the change in units makes things look weird). These have a wavelength of around 2.5 nm, almost 1000 times smaller than the laser they were using.

So, wait, if they put in infrared lasers, how are they getting x-rays out? The laser pulses they use are so intense that they ionize the atoms. It&amp;#39;s easier to think about the effect of the laser as being like a classical electric field, which strips electrons off an atom-- in quantum terms, you&amp;#39;re adding up a bazillion photons to get the electrons out. Later on, when the electron comes back to the atom and recombines, you get all that energy back out at once, hence the x-ray photons out.

As soon as Travis and I read this study, we knew we had to do a follow-up study of our own to see if this finding was simply spurious or if there was actually something to large breasts that indicated health risk - beyond that explained by obesity per se.

The project that Travis and I began over a year ago has culminated in both a hot-off-the-press publication in the journal Obesity, as well as my presentation at this year's Obesity Society meeting in Washington D.C.

In the study, we used body composition data acquired through MRI on about 100 premenopausal women to directly quantify breast size. By using MRI data we significantly improved the methodology used by the authors of the original study on breast size and diabetes risk, who relied on over 20 year recall of cup size as their key measure.

First, we sought to examine if breast tissue volume was associated with any cardiometabolic risk factors, such as glucose tolerance (a known antecedent to type 2 diabetes) and various blood lipids. Since the original authors found an association between cup size and diabetes risk, we expected to find an association between breast volume and cardiometabolic risk factors.

What did we actually find? Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

A study recently released in PLoS ONE suggests that one population of parrotbills fights this brood parasitism by laying eggs of different colors.

.flickr-photo { }.flickr-frameright { float: right; text-align: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; width:40%;}.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Common cuckoos lay eggs that mimic those of the host birds they trick into raising cuckoo chicks. Photo by Sergey Yeliseev.Brood parasitism, in which one bird species lays its eggs in another bird&amp;#39;s nest, has long been considered a likely cause of coevolution [$a] between brood parasites and their hosts, because the interaction exerts strong natural selection on both species. Hosts suffer major fitness consequences if they take on the raising of another bird&amp;#39;s chick—and brood parasite chicks are often bigger, and more aggressive, than their adoptive &amp;quot;siblings,&amp;quot; sometimes pushing them right out of the nest. On the other hand, brood parasites run the risk of losing their offspring to hosts who can recognize a strange egg and eject it from the nest.

One way to avoid raising a cuckoo chick is to lay eggs that look different from cuckoo eggs. Cuckoos counteract this defense by evolving eggs that match their most common hosts—a selective regime proposed to explain rapid rates of species formation in parasitic cuckoo lineages. In the new study, Yang et al. show that this pattern plays out within a single population of ashy-throated parrotbills and the cuckoos that parasitize them. At a forested nature reserve in southwestern China, the team found that parrotbills lay eggs of three different colors: white, blue, or (rarely) pale blue. Common cuckoos in the same area also laid eggs of those three colors, in about the same proportions as the parrotbills—and cuckoo eggs were usually found in host nests with eggs of the same color. Experimental introduction of eggs into parrotbill nests confirmed that parrotbills were more likely to reject eggs colored differently from their own.

That result captures many of the necessary conditions for coevolution between ashy-throated parrotbills and the local cuckoo population; the frequency with which parrotbills reject eggs unlike their own should exert strong selection on the cuckoos, and (conversely) the frequency with which parrotbills fail to reject cuckoo eggs that look like their own should exert selection on the hosts. This isn&amp;#39;t the first case in which brood parasites have apparently forced their hosts to diversify, however—notably, African village weaverbirds evolved less varied egg patterning after being introduced into parasite-free habitats on Mauritius and Hispaniola.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update2***&lt;/strong&gt;: You can read a response from one person with more knowledge of &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/06/02/cfi-budget-cuts-lead-to-a-number-of-firings/#comment-486675"&gt;what happened here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of bitter back and forth between the Center for Inquiry and founder &lt;strong&gt;Paul Kurtz&lt;/strong&gt; (who &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/19/paul-kurtz-resigns-from-center-for-inquiry/"&gt;recently resigned&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Kurtz is reacting to the &lt;a href="http://rjosephhoffmann.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/tuesday-massacre-at-the-center-for-inquiry/"&gt;unceremonious downsizing&lt;/a&gt; that is happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I arrived at the Center for Inquiry at shortly after 1:00PM today. Norman Allen (Director of International Programs and Director of African Americans for Humanism) was carrying a box of books to his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said to Norm, “How are you, Norm” He replied, “I have just been fired by [CEO] Ron Lindsay!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Lindsay nor [executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism Tom] Flynn thanked Norm for his years of service. Norm was stunned. He recently returned from the most successful meeting that African Americans for Humanism ever had (in May in Washington, DC) and that they received world-wide news stories. Moreover, he was enthusiastic about the continued growth of humanism in Africa. There are now 72 groups in over 30 countries! Norm had visited them several times, and he had been in constant contact. Norm believes that the African American Humanist program–the only one of its kind in the North America– will suffer irreparable damage. Similarly for his significant role, not only in Africa, but world-wide, as Norm Allen heads up our international programs….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four other people were fired today in a similar way: Toni Van Pelt, Henry Huber, Rick O’Keefe, and Matthew Sapara. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Policy in Washington, DC and CFI Florida in Tampa have been closed. The downward spiral of the Center for Inquiry continues under the regime of Ronald Lindsay.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget cuts have affected all the organizations in the atheist/Humanist world, but CFI acted on their woes in a rather callous way, it seems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously only one side of the story.  The firings don’t surprise me, because &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/fundraising_appeal/"&gt;when your budget falls&lt;/a&gt;, people have to be let go.  That’s how it goes.  And it’s the leaders’ responsibility to figure out who stays and who doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m more curious as to why it seems to have occurred in a way unbefitting a Humanist organization.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Travis Saunders (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/travissaunders" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;), my SciBling from the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/obesitypanacea/" title=""&gt;Obesity Panacea&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD student in Exercise Physiology at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  My undergrad was in Kinesiology (aka Physical Education) at the University of Calgary, and my Masters was in Exercise Physiology at Queen's University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Travis Saunders pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Travis%20Saunders%20pic.jpg" width="136" height="220" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;My research focuses on the inter-relationships between obesity, physical activity, and chronic disease risk.  For example, I have been involved with studies examining the relationship between different fat depots and health risk (abdominal fat is very bad, but leg fat can actually be protective in some situations), as well as studies examining the benefits of exercise with or without weight-loss (your lipid profile and insulin sensitivity almost always improve in response to exercise, while inflammatory markers seem to improve only in response to weight loss).   I've just begun my PhD, which is looking at the relationship between sedentary time (e.g. sitting) and health risk.  For example, if you run for an hour every morning but then spend the next 7 hours sitting in front of a computer, is your metabolic health going to be better or worse than someone who spends all day on their feet but rarely performs vigorous exercise?  No one knows just yet, but it's a very interesting area of study with important public health implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now most of my time is being spent developing my PhD project, as well as (hopefully) getting a few side projects published.  I'm fortunate to really enjoy my area of research, as well as the people I work with, so it's a pretty fun way to spend my days.  My short-term goal is to do research that is both interesting to me personally and that has a positive influence on the health of the population.  I don't have any specific long-term goals aside from finishing my PhD, but I know that I want to be involved with both research and science communication in whatever I do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely critical that researchers share their findings with the general public, rather than just other colleagues within their research area.  I think it's especially important for those of us performing tax-payer funded research - if the public is paying for our research it only makes sense that we should do everything we can to keep them informed of our results.  If the public is better informed they can make better health decisions, but they are also in a better position to understand the value of our research - a clear win-win!  For a young researcher like myself, the Web is by far the easiest way to communicate with the public about my area of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging has had a very positive impact on my work to date.  Writing a blog is almost like doing 2 or 3 Journal Club presentations every week!  It has forced me to stay up-to-date on the latest studies in my field of research, and has also helped me to develop my understanding of a number of issues (it's one thing to skim through a paper, but it's another thing entirely to write an intelligible blog post about it!)  Blogging has also been tremendously helpful in preparing for conferences - responding to comments and questions online is very similar to responding to questions following a presentation (but in a much less stressful environment).  As a result, it has made me a much more confident writer and speaker, which has direct benefits in my day-to-day work.  And finally, blogging has been a very effective means of spreading the word about my own area of research, which is the whole reason I got into blogging in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first discovered science blogs (and ScienceBlogs) in SEED magazine.  My girlfriend bought me the magazine on a whim and I absolutely loved it, and when I saw an ad for ScienceBlogs I knew it was something that I had to check out.  Around the same time my labmate Peter and I stumbled upon the blogs of Drs &lt;a href="http://www.drsharma.ca/" title=""&gt;Arya Sharma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.weightymatters.ca/" title=""&gt;Yoni Freedhoff&lt;/a&gt;, two physicians who specialize in the treatment of obesity.  That was when we realized that science blogging was something we wanted to get involved with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me personally, the coolest part of ScienceOnline2010 was meeting the bloggers that I have been following for the past few years.  This includes people like yourself, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Scicurious&lt;/a&gt;, the gang from &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" title=""&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://wordmunger.com/" title=""&gt;Dave Munger&lt;/a&gt; to name just a few.  It was especially nice to meet Dave as he's not only a phenomenal writer, but also because he has done such great work promoting peer-reviewed research via &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/" title=""&gt;ResearchBlogging.org&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part for me was meeting all of the other participants.  There were some incredibly talented science-communicators in attendance, and it was a lot of fun to be able to learn from them.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/" title=""&gt;Rebecca Skloot'&lt;/a&gt;s session on pitching story ideas was especially useful, and gave me a much better understanding of how to frame a story in a way that appeals to journalists, which is an extremely important skill as a researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year's conference featured some top-notch science-communicators (&lt;a href="http://www.michaelspecter.com/" title=""&gt;Michael Specter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/" title=""&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, etc); I'd love to see next year's conference bring in a few more top-notch researchers - maybe a Nobel Prize winner or prominent researcher like Brian Greene or Freeman Dyson.  This year's conference helped me learn a lot about science communication from the perspective of journalists and bloggers, but I feel it would be extremely useful to hear what these top researchers could add to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for all the hard work that you and Anton put into the conference, it was an amazing experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/scienceonline2010_-_interview_54.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/pmsn2liBBQY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275494279962"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/local_loon.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc5290b8d19ecd1b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Local loon</title><published>2010-06-02T14:57:40Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T14:57:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/5eFGiOnztL0/local_loon.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/local_loon.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've got 'em.

&lt;p&gt;Oooh, it&amp;#39;s the usual fear-mongering. I had to do a double-take when I saw Dennis Campbell&amp;#39;s summary of the Islamic Strategy, though…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moslems seek to influence a nation by immigration, reproduction, education, the government, illegal drugs, and by supporting the gay agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…because when I think &amp;quot;gay friendly&amp;quot;, I picture the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also wondering if Pastor Campbell thinks that a good way to oppose the influence of immigrating Muslims would be to counterbalance it with more immigration from those Catholics south of the border.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/local_loon.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5eFGiOnztL0" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275494279961"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/botanical_wednesday_better_red.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/603b13d850a012ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Botanical Wednesday: Better red than dead</title><published>2010-06-02T14:27:14Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T14:27:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/WdGCALnYvic/botanical_wednesday_better_red.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/botanical_wednesday_better_red.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_poppy"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/06/poppy.jpeg" width="450" height="423" alt="poppy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Papaver rhoeas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/botanical_wednesday_better_red.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/WdGCALnYvic" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275494279960"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/a_somewhat_baffling_result_ath.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5cdaf1c1ab1de771</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">A somewhat baffling result: atheists are like aspies, but not?</title><published>2010-06-02T13:48:42Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T13:48:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/AZTj1m8yi8U/a_somewhat_baffling_result_ath.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/a_somewhat_baffling_result_ath.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm really confused by this &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=people-with-aspergers-less-likely-t-2010-05-29"&gt;psychology study&lt;/a&gt; — the problem is that I&amp;#39;m getting it second-hand, and the source is a poster at a meeting. It&amp;#39;s interesting, but I want to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethany T. Heywood, a graduate student at Queens University Belfast, asked 27 people with Asperger's Syndrome, a mild type of autism that involves impaired social cognition, about significant events in their lives. Working with experimental psychologist Jesse M. Bering (author of the "Bering in Mind" blog and a frequent contributor to Scientific American MIND), she asked them to speculate about why these important events happened--for instance, why they had gone through an illness or why they met a significant other. As compared with 34 neurotypical people, those with Asperger's syndrome were significantly less likely to invoke a teleological response--for example, saying the event was meant to unfold in a particular way or explaining that God had a hand in it. They were more likely to invoke a natural cause (such as blaming an illness on a virus they thought they were exposed to) or to give a descriptive response, explaining the event again in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m liking the aspies here — they sound so much more rational than the neurotypical people, who invent magical explanations. But then an additional experiment with a twist comes along:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second experiment, Heywood and Bering compared 27 people with Asperger's with 34 neurotypical people who are atheists. The atheists, as expected, often invoked anti-teleological responses such as "there is no reason why; things just happen." The people with Asperger's were significantly less likely to offer such anti-teleological explanations than the atheists, indicating they were not engaged in teleological thinking at all. (The atheists, in contrast, revealed themselves to be reasoning teleologically, but then they rejected those thoughts.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm liking the atheists, too, and I'm not at all unhappy with being compared to people with Asperger's. What I'm mystified by, though, is how they classified non-teleological vs. anti-teleological statements, and how they came to the conclusion that atheists are reasoning teleologically, since that doesn't really follow from the description above. When I'm dealing with those neurotypical religiots, I am aware that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; will ascribe divine planning to events…so it&amp;#39;s not necessarily that I am thinking teleologically, but that I&amp;#39;m aware that I need to short-circuit a logical leap they routinely make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, if you're put off by the comparison of atheism with Asperger's, don't be: aspies aren't that bad, are often difficult to detect, and besides, the article compares religious thinking to schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one of the authors of the work &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/bering-in-mind-blog/"&gt;has a blog&lt;/a&gt;, maybe there will be some clarification there sometime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/a_somewhat_baffling_result_ath.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/AZTj1m8yi8U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275494108457"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=16606">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64aa0fb120918804</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="Science"/><category term="ESO"/><category term="NGC 6118"/><category term="spiral galaxy"/><category term="VLT"/><title type="html">Take a moment to just soak in a beautiful spiral</title><published>2010-06-02T15:25:59Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T15:25:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/GlBxt1FCQMs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/02/take-a-moment-to-just-soak-in-a-beautiful-spiral/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, every now and again you just need to look at &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1022a/"&gt;a beautiful image of a spiral galaxy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/images/large/potw1022a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/eso_ngc6118.jpg" alt="eso_ngc6118" title="eso_ngc6118" width="610" height="487"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, you want to click that image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s NGC 6118 as seen by the European Southern Observatory’s 8-meter wide Very Large Telescope in this newly-released image. The VLT’s 500,000 square centimeters (78,000 square inches) of mirror really suck down the light, giving us a stunning near-true-color view of this spiral. Even from 80 million light years away we can trace the positions of pinkish star factories, the dark dust lanes, and see the reddish-yellow glow of old stars in the galactic hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was drawn to how tightly wound the galaxy is, and how long the arms are. Starting at the nucleus you can trace the two major arms all the way around more than once. The galaxy is tilted severely, so it’s hard to say what’s going on at the lower right; does the arm split there? &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That sort of thing is called a &lt;a href="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ostriker/research/spurs/project.html"&gt;&amp;quot;spur&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and they can form as the gas in the galaxy interacts with the arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the stars you see in the picture are in the foreground, in our galaxy. It’s like looking out a dirty window at a tree outside; the spots are close by, the tree much farther. But you can also see dozens of small galaxies, too, which are not small at all, but in reality other majestic and grand objects diminished by their even greater distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGC 6118 is about 100,000 light years across, making it the same size as our own galaxy. And when I see something like this, I always ask myself the same thing I did when I was just a kid: is someone else out there looking back at us, and marveling at the beauty of the Milky Way?&lt;/p&gt;

It contains this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, ladies, I get it. It’s your &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. The opening credits make your tummy tickle the same way the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; theme, to this day, gives me a boner. I understand. A pair of expensive shoes worn by Carrie is just like a metallic bikini worn by Princess Leia. Bonerfreakingopolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me address this. WHAT THE ****  ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, DUDE? I’m a lady. You know what my Star Wars is? It’s Star Wars. The same as YOUR Star Wars. Star Wars doesn’t have a freaking gender certificate next to its age rating. Millions of women have seen Star Wars. Millions of women love Star Wars.  I bet you don’t own a copy of the novel entitled Lando Calrissian and the Starcave of ThonBoka. I do. I bet you didn’t own a Darth Maul that lights up when you twist him. I did. I got rid of him because Darth Maul is a bit shit, but still. I bet you don’t own every copy of the comic Star Wars Tales AND a page of the original artwork from the George R. Binks story by Tony Millionaire. I DO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, my male friend, am not alone. Here’s a little tip for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women are not the Borg* &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*This is not a Star &lt;em&gt;Wars&lt;/em&gt; reference. I will assume you already know that because I haven’t decided up front what you do and don’t like based on your gender. That would be sexist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tracy King</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275492835790"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=12896">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e062883dfd43d3ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="contest"/><title type="html">Best movies (add yours)</title><published>2010-06-02T15:33:13Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T15:33:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/best-movies-add-yours" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I’m off for a while, I thought I’d leave with a post that can get readers involved in a mutually beneficial way. I’m speaking of a list of favorite movies.  I’ve given below my twenty all-time favorites, and since I’ve seen a lot of movies let me just call these the “best movies”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know this isn’t about biology or atheism or cats.  And I also know that many of you will take issue with these choices, and argue that better movies were left out.  I plead that this list is of course subjective, and also constructed this morning from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To point us all to good films, do post your own list of five (or more) of your favorite movies, highlighting your all-time favorite with a few words. When I return I’ll send an autographed paperback of &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt; to the commenter who provides the best list (which of course includes a good blurb for the top movie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each movie I’ve added a link to the group of reviews at R&lt;em&gt;otten Tomatoes&lt;/em&gt;, my favorite movie-rating site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_picture_show/"&gt;The Last Picture Show.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt; My all-time favorite, a haunting black-and-white essay, at once hilarious and ineffably sad, on our loneliness and failure to connect with others. It’s set in the oil town of Archer City, Texas (called “Anarene”) in the 1950s, and has an all-star cast—before many of them became stars.  I’ve put below a YouTube clip of my favorite scene, Sam the Lion’s (Ben Johnson’s) soliloquy. Shoot me for saying this, but I find the scene the emotional equal of anything in Shakespeare.  Because of this movie I made a pilgrimage to Archer City in 1972, and found it &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; as it was in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passion_of_joan_of_arc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passion of Joan of Arc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The only silent movie on this list, and the best silent movie of all time.  Maria Falconetti gives a fantastic performance of Joan during her trial and execution.  You won’t believe that a movie without sound can be this good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chinatown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chinatown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;My favorite film noir, a wonderful interaction between Jack Nicholson, who plays a detective, and director Roman Polanski.  This is the kind of movie that makes you feel really unsettled as you leave the theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wings_of_desire/?critic=creamcrop#contentReviews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wings of Desire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Wim Wender’s masterpiece.  Angels hover over post-war Berlin, listening to the thoughts of its inhabitants and sometimes falling in love with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/best_years_of_our_lives/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Best Years of Our Lives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; This was a “popular” movie, made to entertain Americans after WWII.  But it far transcends entertainment. It’s a gripping story of three veterans as they return from the war and try to put their lives together.  Harold Russell, a genuine vet and non-actor, who lost his hands in the war, gives a stirring performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/best_years_of_our_lives/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Klaus Kinski’s best performance in Werner Herzog’s twisted tale of a group of conquistadors, led by a madman, trying to find the city of El Dorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100211/REVIEWS08/100219991/1023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make Way for Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(1937).   You won’t have heard of this movie, for it’s simply been forgotten. I was put 0nto it by my film-maven nephew after telling him how much I liked &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Story&lt;/em&gt; (see below). Like that movie, it’s a meditation on age—specifically, the rejection of aging parents by their children.  Parts of it seem a bit cheesy now, but it will still break your heart.  There are no reviews at &lt;em&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/em&gt;, so I’ve linked to Roger Ebert’s review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tokyo_story/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tokyo Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/late_spring/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Late Spring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/soshun/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Early Spring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/akibiyori/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Late Autumn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; If you haven’t heard of director Yasujiro Ozu, you’re in for a treat.  These four movies are, I think, his best.  They’re slow moving essays on family life in postwar Japan, and not for fans of quick-cut, fast-paced plots. &lt;em&gt;Tokyo Story&lt;/em&gt;, which deals with the relationship between aging parents and their children, may be (along with &lt;em&gt;Ikiru&lt;/em&gt;) the best foreign film ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lawrence_of_arabia/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawrence of Arabia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt; The best Hollywood blockbuster of all time. Great acting (especially by Peter O’Toole, who was born for the part), great photography, great story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_waterfront/"&gt;On the Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando.  Enough said. (Oh, and it was a tough choice between this movie and the other great film of this duo, &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1020333-streetcar_named_desire/"&gt;A Streetcar Named Desire&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1092277-wizard_of_oz/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wizard of Oz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Any list of best movies that leaves this out is deficient.  Have you seen it lately? This is the only movie on the list that’s a masterpiece for both children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Godfather&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather/"&gt;Parts I&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godfather_part_ii/"&gt; II&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt; We all know that Part III sucked, but Part II is the best sequel ever made (unless you consider Ozu’s movies as sequels).  I still consider Part I the best, but others disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/y_tu_mama_tambien/"&gt;Y Tu Mama Tambien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Loosely translated as “So’s Your Momma,” this is a Mexican film directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It’s the only coming-of-age movie on this list (I suppose &lt;em&gt;The Last Picture Show&lt;/em&gt; might qualify) but it’s more than that.  It’s a depiction of class differences in modern Mexico, set within a comedy that includes a tragedy.  Oh, and it’s the most erotic movie here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ikiru/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikiru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve seen all of Kurosawa’s “epic” films, but this, an early black-and-white movie, is far better—perhaps the best foreign film ever made. It’s about a Japanese bureaucrat who finds meaning in life only after discovering he has terminal cancer.  Unless you have no feelings, it will make you cry.  The last scene is unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two movies that don’t come up to the others as world-class films, but I love them nonetheless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comedy: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annie_hall/"&gt;Annie Hall.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Outstrips by a huge margin all other movies by Woody Allen.  Every scene is a classic, and just thinking about them makes me smile.  The Marshall McLuhan scene, the lobster scene, the dinner scene from Alvy’s childhood contrasted with that from Annie’s—sheer comic genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musical: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yankee_doodle_dandy/"&gt;Yankee Doodle Dandy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; You didn’t know that Jimmy Cagney could dance? He could—brilliantly, and his singing, dancing, and acting skills all make for a high-energy story of the songwriter George M. Cohan. As a kid I used to watch this every fourth of July (like &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1010792-its_a_wonderful_life/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a Wonderful Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it was always shown on the appropriate holiday), and I still have to watch it whenever it’s on. (Singin’ in the Rain runs a close second).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve left off some universally acclaimed movies because I either haven’t seen them (e.g., &lt;em&gt;The Bicycle Thief&lt;/em&gt;) or I can’t evaluate them properly because there’s been too much hype (&lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, tell us what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a scene from &lt;em&gt;The Last Picture Show&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

To save endangered species, conservationists need to know which species populations are contracting or expanding. Restoring an ecosystem requires an accurate picture of how the ecosystem existed historically. Unfortunately, existing global data collections such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and IUCN Red List underrepresent some geographic areas, especially in the tropics, and may not show accurate distribution or trends for many species that live there. A further problem with newer datasets is that conservation organizations have focused largely on endangered species and nature reserves and lack the broad baseline data that may be necessary for future conservation problems.A new study measures how well existing data compilations cover the Galliformes, an order that is well-studied and contains many threatened species. The datasets surveyed included museum collections, scientific articles, banding records, bird atlases, and birders&amp;#39; trip reports (archived on sites such as travellingbirder.com). Museum collections are the most significant source of historical distribution data, and scientific literature has gained importance over time. Birding reports are a relatively new phenomenon and still account for relatively few records, with most of those coming from birding hotspots.Geographic coverage of different data sources: A) museums, B) literature, C) banding, D) atlases, and E) website trip reports The data sources vary in how much geographic area they cover. Museum collections are the most comprehensive as a whole, though individual collections may be more localized. Scientific literature covers western Europe, China, and southern Asia well, but not as many studies are available for other regions. Banding data and atlases were largely confined to western Europe. Birding trip reports provide broader coverage than banding or atlases but are concentrated in well-known hotspots and easily accessible locations. Because active specimen collecting has declined, contemporary data sources are less geographically comprehensive than older ones (see maps below).Records for all galliform species across the Indian Subcontinent from A) pre-1930 and B) 1990–2006The authors offer three suggestions for improving the geographic coverage and usability of biodiversity data:Museum collections and sightings data from scientific literature should be catalogued in electronic databases to make historical data more accessible.*Observation records should include a date and location, preferably with geographic coordinates, and be incorporated into a central database to avoid fragmentation.Observers should report all species rather than just rare or threatened ones and should look outside of known biodiversity hotspots.They see a role for citizen science projects to monitor biodiversity and cite eBird specifically as an example of how a citizen science project should collect data from users. From their perspective, its principal strengths include requiring users to enter a date and geotagged location, flagging unusual records for review by regional editors, and encouraging participants to submit checklists from areas with few observations. Unfortunately eBird has so far been limited to the Americas (though it will expand coverage soon) and only records bird observations. The authors hope, however, that eBird&amp;#39;s model can be expanded to other taxa, even less charismatic ones.* Though the authors do not cite it specifically, the North American Bird Phenology Program still needs volunteers to scan and transcribe thousands of historical observations.Boakes, E., McGowan, P., Fuller, R., Chang-qing, D., Clark, N., O&amp;#39;Connor, K., &amp;amp; Mace, G.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi Café Friends,
Our June Science Café (description below) will be held on Tuesday 6/15 at the Irregardless Café on Morgan Street.   Our café speaker for the evening will be Dr. Dianne Dunning from the NCSU School of Veterinary Medicine.  Join us for a thought provoking discussion with Dr. Dunning about the relationships humans have with animals in our increasingly crowded world. 

&lt;p&gt;The Human-Animal Bond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday June 15, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time:  6:30 - 8:30 pm with discussions beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: The Irregardless Café, 901 W. Morgan Street, Raleigh 833-8898&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animals touch our daily lives -- from the pets we keep, to the food we eat, to the health care advances we enjoy. Current animal welfare concerns include pet overpopulation, rescue and care of animals in disasters, treatment of food animals, biomedical research involving animals, and the affects of global urbanization and environmental change on wildlife. Our evolving human-animal bond and the mandate to be good stewards of animal welfare are at the heart of these concerns. Join our discussion about how the integration of veterinary medicine and animal science, as well as ethics and public policy, can dictate how successfully these concerns are addressed, and how the diverse needs of humans and animals are met on a local and global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dianne Dunning is a clinical associate professor and the director of the Animal Welfare, Ethics and Public Policy Program (AWEPP) at the NC State College of Veterinary Medicine. Through professional education, public service, research and public policy development, AWEPP seeks to explore and address issues including pet abandonment, animal abuse and fighting, companion animal loss and grief, and the link between animal health and human well being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please RSVP (Katey Ahmann: kateyDOTahmannATncdenrDOTgov ) if you are able to come - As always, I will be communicating with the restaurant so that we can have a good set-up for our group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to seeing eveyone on the 15th - hope you can come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/science_cafe_raleigh_-_the_hum.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/3yMrHXH_tBk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275490864498"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3828357506008327873">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/454c60864bacfa25</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Eric On Believing Despite Not Being Able to Explain the Atonement</title><published>2010-06-02T14:07:00Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T15:21:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/jurNvsgiKno/eric-on-believing-despite-not-being.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3828357506008327873/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3828357506008327873" title="5 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/06/eric-on-believing-despite-not-being.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;I'm producing several posts called: "Reality Check: What Must Be the Case if Christianity is True?" In &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/05/reality-check-what-must-be-case-if_28.html"&gt;a recent one &lt;/a&gt; I wrote: "17) That although there is no rational explanation for why Jesus had to die on the cross to atone for our sins, his death atoned for our sins." From this a discussion ensued between Eric, who is a Christian Ph.D. student, and me. It's interesting to see where discussions lead and I want to highlight this one out of the many other issues that were raised in the comments.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric said &lt;blockquote&gt;I don't find this objection problematic at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John is a writer. He communicates with words, phrases and sentences. Communication with words, phrases and sentences presupposes that words, phrases and sentences have *meaning*, but anyone who has studied philosophy of language will tell you we have not figured out how words, phrases and sentences mean anything. (We have a host of competing theories, just as we have competing theories of the atonement.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We thus get:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(17') We cannot explain how words, phrases and sentences mean anything, but John writes books, so words, phrases and sentences mean something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does this stop you from writing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That aside, any reasoning of the form, "We don't have a rational explanation for X, so either not X or probably not X" is just blatantly fallacious. (And, clearly, at least "probably not X" is implied by John's post.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;John said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Okay Eric, a hidden premise is that if God wants us to believe in him then we should be able to rationally explain more things than we can, for the more we cannot understand about him the less we think he exists. The atonement is one belief that cannot be rationally explained. So is the Trinity. So is the incarnation. So also is personal identity after death. So also is timeless bodiless existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If God wants us to believe his ways are reasonable and good then we must be able to know enough about his ways to think they are reasonable and good. After all, he created our minds and supposedly tells us to use them, so we would expect that when we do we could understand enough of his ways to know they are reasonable and good&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eric said...&lt;blockquote&gt;I agree with this in general, but it's not, it seems to me, easy to apply in each particular case. For example, considering (17) for the moment, is it the case that understanding the 'mechanics' of the atonement is a necessary condition for rational belief in God? I don't see how that's a tenable position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm reminded of what Professor Peter Kreeft has said about the Eucharist: Jesus didn't say, "Take this and understand," but "take this and eat." Don't get me wrong: I'd prefer to understand too. But the question is, Is it necessary (in any particular case, with respect to the rationality of a belief) to understand? (This is true of any worldview: consider all the things physicalists don't understand, but have no problem accepting, about the world.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;At this point several good comments were devoted to Eric's Catholicism, but leaving that aside...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John W. Loftus said... &lt;blockquote&gt;Eric there are other considerations. When it comes to understanding something there must be evidence that there is something to understand, a known fact that needs an explanation, if you will. With the atonement there is no known fact to understand, but a mere assertion that Jesus atoned for sins. If no sense can be made of an assertion without a basis in fact then it is most likely a false assertion. And as I said the more you cannot explain or understand what you think is the case then the more that what you believe is false, especially when there are no known facts to explain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your notion of God explains everything doesn't it? But when you have an explanation that explains everything then it explains too much. It ends up not being an explanation at all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eric said...&lt;blockquote&gt;Here's the data it seems to me we're working with (note, these aren't 'known facts' in the strong sense of the phrase -- few things are, as you well know -- but they are what Christians believe to be true, and which they have reasons to believe to be true):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a God. God is the creator and sustainer of all that exists. Human beings exist in the image of God, in terms of reason and will, and thus stand in a special relationship to God. There is a right way to stand in relationship to God, and a wrong way, and we're standing in the wrong relationship to God. God became man to right this wrong relationship, and he did it as it has always been done -- with a sacrifice. In the past, priests offered sacrifices, but in this case God is both the priest and the sacrifice. This sacrifice, which provides us the means of standing in the proper relationship to God, is what we call the atonement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven't 'explained' the atonement there, but have provided the data we're working with. You of course dispute each and every piece of data, and that's fine. But if you want to discuss whether the atonement makes sense, you can do it by either (1) denying the data, or (2) presupposing the data for the sake of argument and going on from there. With respect to (17), you seemed to be taking the latter approach, and it was *that* argument I was criticizing. If you want to now approach the question with (1), well we're back to the most fundamental questions in this whole debate (why think God exists, etc.).&lt;blockquote&gt;"Your notion of God explains everything doesn't it?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, of course. God as most informed Christians understand him -- that is, as the pure act of "to be" itself -- *must* explain everything. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Ignoring Eric's last comment because it is as I said, I continued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John W. Loftus said... &lt;blockquote&gt;Eric, I don't know where you stand on the atonement. Apparently you agree with me that there isn't a rational explanation for it, as you might admit for the problem of evil, the Trinity and the incarnation. At some point the lack of a rational explanation for these and other beliefs of yours would be fatal to your faith. No one can say in advance how much incomprehensible mystery you can allow and still believe. But that is simply way over the top for me especially when there is a corresponding lack of evidence to believe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eric said... &lt;blockquote&gt;This is a somewhat glib response (I can't remember where I read it), but there's nonetheless something to it: I find the mysteries and the questions that belief in God evokes to be more satisfying than the the answers non-belief provides. (One could also refer to Newman here: "Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt." He's right.) That's true in part because we all have our mysteries: it's not as if it's a choice between mysteries and questions on the one hand, and perfect understanding on the other. The naturalist/physicalist faces mysteries as serious as those of any theist. You've said something similar in the past, John (it may have been on "The Things That Matter Most"), when you suggested that whatever the truth about reality is, it's absurd. You have your mysteries and I have mine, and we both have to find ways to deal with them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;John W. Loftus said... &lt;blockquote&gt;Eric, yes, but keep in mind that the choices before us are emphatically not between your particular brand of Christianity and atheism. For some reason it appears you forget this. I don't. What you've done is to isolate your modern Catholic Christianity as the only religious choice before you and you contrast that option with unbelief. You know differently but you don't seem to take that into account when assessing what is the case. All affirmative claims have anomalies and mysteries that we must all put on the back burner. But your choice is emphatically not between Catholicism and atheism. The options are myriad and anyone of these other choices could say the same things you just did and keep on believing. Because I understand this I argue that the default position is agnosticism. You ought therefore become an agnostic, like I am. But agnosticism naturally pushes us toward atheism since they are almost twins. Having denied all extraordinary religious claims the agnostic simply concludes no extraordinary claims have any support. Having denied all supernatural explanations and beings by a process of elimination the agnostic simply denies they exist. A person like that is an atheist, a skeptic of all such claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eric said...&lt;blockquote&gt;John, I would agree *if* (1) it were the case that all other alternatives were equally well supported (such that they in effect canceled one another out), and (2) I didn't have good reasons for thinking that the beliefs I do hold are well justified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see no reason to think (1) obtains: for example, I have concluded that any type of Christianity that teaches sola scriptura is logically self refuting (since scripture doesn't teach sola scriptura). This example alone, if it holds, and if Catholicism isn't similarly self defeating, refutes (1).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even if I cannot refute (1) -- and there are of course myriad religions I have never heard of, let alone studied or refuted -- I'm still not in the religiously equivalent position of Buridan's ass if (2) is false. And, of course, I have concluded that (2) is false, since I think I have good reasons for concluding that Catholicism is true. Take any scientific theory as an example: given underdetermination, we know there are countless possible, and empirically indistinguishable, alternative theories, most of which no one has ever refuted, because no one has ever formulated them. But it doesn't follow that we're not justified in accepting theories we think we have good reasons to accept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, your argument seems to me to presuppose that (1) and (2) obtain, and I see no good reasons to think they do&lt;/blockquote&gt;John said...&lt;blockquote&gt;Eric, you have an unjustifiably high regard for your own reasoning abilities given that (a) we are all products of our times, that is, when and where we're born; and b) there is no evidence that can decisively answer these religious disputes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a shame someone like you cannot factor (a) and (b) into your equations and come to agnosticism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you really know the alternatives are not well-supported?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can you conclude that people around the world are stupid when compared to you such that they do NOT have good reasons for what they accept? Have you ever tried to convince them otherwise? Try it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eric said...&lt;blockquote&gt;John, you've spoken out on a number of moral issues on this blog. But you must have an unjustifiably high regard for your reasoning abilities given a) and b). The same could be said for political opinions, scientific opinions, etc. all of which are subject to a) and b). Do you see the problem here? Life *requires* us to make sundry decisions for which we have incomplete information -- information that is often ineluctably colored by our cultural prejudices -- and during which we use fallible reasoning processes. How many moral, political, etc. issues can *you* answer *decisively*? Few, if any at all, correct? But you still hold them, don't you? You'd even be willing to give your life to uphold some of them, wouldn't you? You can't demonstrate much more commitment to the truth of a claim than that.&lt;blockquote&gt;"How can you conclude that people around the world are stupid when compared to you such that they do NOT have good reasons for what they accept?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;John, you know better than this. A false belief can be held rationally by a remarkably intelligent person, so it's decidedly not the case that my potion entails that I conclude those who disagree with me are 'stupid.' You're confusing the truth value of a claim here with its justification.&lt;/blockquote&gt;John W. Loftus said... &lt;blockquote&gt;Eric, so what, you're rational. Big deal. I am too. Rationality is not enough. Why can't you be rational enough to conclude this and that given the human propensity to accept and defend what we were all raised with and given the propensity to defend what we prefer to believe that we need some hard evidence to accept something? Otherwise we will be building intellectually coherent castles in the sky that never have to touch down on solid ground?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will do you no good at all to point out I have the same intellectual difficulties. You must still deal with your problems regardless of whether or not I do. But in fact I do, and I think I'm a lot more consistent than you are. I'm trying to be skeptical of everything consistently. You are not. I'm rational enough about these difficulties to be an agnostic. That's the most rational conclusion given what we know about human rationality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eric said...&lt;blockquote&gt;John, with all due respect, you are decidedly *not* in any meaningful sense an agnostic when it comes to moral claims. I could point to post after post after post to prove it. Yet your moral conclusions are just as subject to a) and b) as my religious conclusions are -- perhaps more so. Therefore, on the contrary, it seems to me as if I'm more consistent than you are here, since I recognize that we all must make commitments to the truth of sundry propositions that are subject to a) and b), while you claim that you're a consistent skeptic. In fact, few things are more difficult than being a consistent skeptic: I know of no one in the history of philosophy, from Pyrrho to Hume to Rorty, who has ever succeeded at that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;John said...&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, I most definitely am agnostic about some moral claims and I'm most definitely not agnostic about other claims. It depends on the moral claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I maintain that extraordinary faith claims need a lot of evidence for them and that Christianity is not supported by the available evidence nor can it make any rational sense of many of its doctrines. I maintain that because of (a) and (b) people will defend what they are raised to believe and what they prefer to believe. Because of these facts they should be reasonable enough to become agnostics about extraordinary claims until there is sufficient evidence for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is there about morality that is an extraordinary claim? There is some evidence needed, yes, for some claims. We have morals. They evolve. They are important to us. Want to know why? Because I want to live in some peace and security and pursue my goals unhindered by others in a community of people who help each other. Life is best lived that way. How do I know? Because I do not want people to steal from me or rape my daughter. My God what are you looking for here? I DO NOT NEED ANY EVIDENCE TO SAY TO AN ANNOYING PERSON OR THIEF OR RAPIST TO GET OUT OF MY FACE! I don't want him there. And I wish to grant everyone that same moral/political right or else I cannot claim that right myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Geese 'O Pete, Eric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric, when it comes to basic ethics most people agree. Basic ethics are the kinds of behavior that are expected from people when there are no dilemma's or extenuating circumstances, like tell the truth, be kind to others, share with the needy, treat others the way you want treated, and so forth. Almost all ethicists will argue for these things. C.S. Lewis's book &lt;i&gt;Abolition of Man &lt;/i&gt;shows we have these shared basic morals. So what's there to be agnostic about them? Nothing I can see. It makes life better for all of us. If I have to defend why these ethics makes life better for all of us with you then something is wrong. Suffice it to say with Aristotle that holistic happiness (eudomia) is an end in and of itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our disputes arise when it comes to dilemma ethics, that is, what behavior we should expect from people when they have to make a choice between two different basic ethical obligations (i.e., don't lie vs save a life, and so forth).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's very interesting to me is that when facing these moral dilemmas there is no way in advance to predict what behavior will be recommended by ethicists who hold to different meta-ethical foundations in all cases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3828357506008327873?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out more of our exclusive video chat with Piper Kerman, where she  talks about the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/friendships-in-prison-more-exclusive-video-of-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black/"&gt;surprising and unexpected friendships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/more-exclusive-video-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-on-guilt-forgiveness-and-redemption/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; she developed while in prison.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age 34, Piper Kerman was sent to  federal prison for a ten-year-old     drug smuggling and money laundering offense.  She spent 13 months in a     minimum-security correctional facility for  women in Danbury, CT,  which    isn’t necessarily what you’d expect from a  blonde-haired,  blue-eyed    Smith graduate and Red Sox fan from a nice, New  England  family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper’s excellent memoir about her prison experience, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385523386?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=randohouseinc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385523386target="&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was just  published     by Random House – with back cover blurbs by Dave Eggers and    Elizabeth   Gilbert (not bad for a first-time writer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper sat down with Blisstree for the afternoon to discuss all      aspects of her time in the clink, from &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/exclusive-video-our-conversation-with-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black/"&gt;skincare in prison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/more-exclusive-video-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-on-guilt-forgiveness-and-redemption/"&gt;guilt and forgiveness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/yoga-and-fitness-behind-bars-personal-insights-from-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-%E2%80%93-video-exclusive/"&gt;how yoga saved her sanity&lt;/a&gt;, to the torturous six  years she and her   now-husband  spent in  limbo between her  conviction  and the day she    self-surrendered in Danbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the 6th segment of our exclusive video interview with      Piper, where we ask her if she ever sought therapy before or after her prison ordeal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Share this video on your own site:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And check back for Piper’s next video, coming soon – we even got      Piper’s husband, Larry Smith of &lt;a href="http://www.smithmag.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, to talk on camera about his  side of the story&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Vanessa is a Research Scientist in Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and studies the cognition of chimpanzees and bonobos in Congo.

In my new book Bonobo Handshake, I talk about a bonobo called Mimi who throws herself over the dead body of another bonobo.

Lipopo was a seven year old bonobo who was new to the group. Mimi wasn't particularly fond of him, she just kindof ignored him most of the time. When Lipopo died, Mimi stood over the body and wouldn't let the keepers take him.

The keepers turned up with long poles to take the body away, a scary sight for any bonobo - they are usually quite shy. But Mimi would not give up the body.

She pushed at the poles and she held on to the body. She just kept grooming his face and trying to keep the flies away. It was as though she was mourning his death but still felt she had to protect him.

The body was in a tight space, near the tunnel. She must have been afraid but she wouldn’t let him go. Then Crispin the vet turned up with the ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F06%2F02%2Fare-bonobos-altruistic%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275487561069"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/openhelix/GhpE/~3/HXiXDStU7-0/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/76864554f2053154</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Tip of the Week: Database of mouse databases</title><published>2010-06-02T09:15:41Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T09:15:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/1uyo67Z4UM8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/openhelix/GhpE/~3/HXiXDStU7-0/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">We are acutely aware of the thousands of bioinformatics resources out there, and we are often asked for guidance on finding a particular type of tool for some function or other.  There are some excellent lists out there which attempt to catalog the various tools–the NAR Database Issue and corresponding list, the Resource Collection at the Univ. of Pittsburg, and others.  But recently we saw one developed with a specific focus, which claims to bring together over 200 resources for the mouse.  The Mouse Resource Browser collects and categorizes a number of different types of things–not just databases, as we’ll see.  Find them here: http://bioit.fleming.gr/mrb

The curated collection of sites that may  be of use to mouse researchers has a number of features.  The developers used a questionnaire to elicit some information from the resource providers, and when they don’t have that input they have created some basic information for the records themselves. You can do a basic search for resources with a quick search box. There is an advanced search option.  I found the option of browsing by category (they have 22 categories) the most informative to figure out what kind of resources they had collected.

The data for a given record is organized across a series of tabs:

General: description, highlights and subject matter of the resource

Ontologies and Standards: if the resource relies on any of the important vocabularies or standards formats in the field, they are listed here

Technical: details of implementation, type of database, access methods, if there is a web services component, whether there are downloads or not

CASIMIR DDF: this is an interesting tab that assesses some of the features of the resources such as currency/updates, quality control process, versioning, technical documentation, user support, and more.

Although the focus is mouse, you’ll see some more broad types of resources in there.  For example, UCSC Genome Browser is listed as there is a mouse database there.  Reactome is listed.  These have a species range and include mouse, but are certainly not focused on mouses.  Other types of resources include commercial suppliers such as Charles River. So it isn’t limited just to things like sequence databases and things of that nature–it’s got more aspects that researchers employing mouse as a model system might find useful.

There are some choices they have made that I’m not sure I would have.  They list the MGI mailing list as a separate feature from MGI.  But as I thought more about it, I could see why.  There is good information there, and if you don’t know of it already a pointer might help.  But as I was thinking of the 200+ resources just for mouse, I thought that sort of affected the total.

If you use mouse as your model system, you will probably find some useful databases and other web sites that are handy for your work.  If you don’t work with mice, there are probably still some useful resources for your work as well.  Check out MRB’s site for more information: http://bioit.fleming.gr/mrb

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/cp-iB6jwjUc%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=360" width="580" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t agree with everything therein; you can’t judge a site by its ads, for one thing. But he does a good dismantling of the claim that Phil Jones — a climatologist at the University of East Anglia, and a man who was at the center of the bogus &amp;quot;climategate&amp;quot; nonsense — says there’s been no warming since 1995. That claim is nothing less than an outright lie, a cherry-picked quotation taken out of context and basically the opposite of what Jones actually said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This video is just one of many, and I’ll have to go through &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=029130BFDC78FA33"&gt;them all&lt;/a&gt; as I have time. Every time I post something on climate change, the noise machine swings into full mania, with comments that show beyond a doubt that a lot of people have no clue what they’re talking about, but still feel that scientists who have devoted their entire lives and careers to climatology are idiots. That is, sadly, the state of the &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot; today.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, isn't that what bloggin's all about? Oh, wait, that's what I do almost every day here. No, what I really mean is that I came across an article that struck rather close to home regarding my career trajectory. So, if you don't mind, for one day I'll leave behind the rabid anti-vaccine loons, the homepaths, the alt-med mavens, and other assorted cranks and look at a problem that I've written about before but feel in the mood to discuss again. The impetus for this is an article by Andrew Schafer that was published in &lt;em&gt;Science Careers&lt;/em&gt; entitled &lt;a href="http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2010_05_28/caredit.a1000054"&gt;Perspective: The Successful Physician-Scientist of the 21st Century&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Physician-scientists have always brought a unique perspective to biomedical research that is inspired by their personal experience in caring for patients. Indeed, throughout history, physicians have played a central role in advancing the science of medicine as the "translators" of medical research. Yet there has been growing concern over the past 3 decades that the workforce of physician-scientists, at least in the form we have come to know them in previous generations, may be vanishing.

&lt;p&gt;We have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/the_physician-scientist_an_endangered_sp.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/the_physician-scientist_an_endangered_sp.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/YwmDZCC89G0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275483888622"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/no_not_the_jains.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e963da42b6a6d0dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">No, not the Jains!</title><published>2010-06-02T13:30:42Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T13:30:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/mVhpDMUaKk0/no_not_the_jains.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/no_not_the_jains.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A curious phenomenon has struck me a few times: in response to my criticisms of religion, someone will bring up the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"&gt;Jains&lt;/a&gt;. It's a peaceful religion, they'll say, that promotes kindness to all living beings, therefore my arguments are all invalid. Even more strangely, every time this happens, my interlocutor is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a Jain, which always leaves me wondering why, if this faith is so wonderful, they haven't converted. Besides, my main gripe with religion isn't that it makes people evil (the overwhelming majority of believers, whether Christian, Muslim, or whatever, are peaceable, cooperative, normal human beings), but that it's a petrified clown turd of foolishness that convinces people that it's OK to be a credulous git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Jainism is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prahlad Jani, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/physiology_explains_it_all.php"&gt;Indian fakir who claims to live on nothing but air and sunshine&lt;/a&gt;, is a transparent fraud with gullible friends in a high places. &lt;a href="http://sanaledamaruku.blogspot.com/2010/05/guardian-indias-man-who-lives-on.html"&gt;Indian skeptics have found obvious flaws in the 'testing' that has been going on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the test was running, I exposed some of those loopholes in a live programme on India TV: an official video clip revealed that Jani would sometimes move out of the CCTV camera's field of view; he was allowed to receive devotees and could even leave the sealed test room for a sun bath; his regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored and so on. I demanded an opportunity to check the test set-up with an independent team of rationalist experts. There was no immediate reaction from Ahmadabad. But a sudden call from Sterling hospital invited me - live on TV - to join the test the next day itself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Early morning, ready to fly to Gujarat, we were informed that we had to wait for the permission of the "top boss" of the project. Needless to say: this permission never came.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Similarly, we were unable to attend Shah's first Jani test in November 2003 (that was financed by Dipas too). Shah has a long record of conducting these studies, which up till now have never been discussed in any scientific journal. They merely try to prove his strange sunshine theory: that humans can stop eating and drinking and switch to "other energy sources, sunlight being one". Prahlad Jani is not Shah's first poster child. In 2000/2001, he tested one Hira Manek for more than a year and confirmed his claim that he was feeding on sunshine only (and sometimes a little water). The idea that Shah's research was investigated by Nasa and the University of Pennsylvania was officially denied by both the misrepresented parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So…he&amp;#39;s a complete phony, and the fellow running the tests, Dr Sudhir Shah is either incompetent or a conspirator. Guess what Shah&amp;#39;s religion is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah is a deeply religious Jain. As the president of the Indian Jain Doctors' Federation (JDF), he proposes that via research, the still imperfect science of medicine is to be brought in line with the Jainist '"super-science" as revealed by the omniscient Lord Mahavir.

In pain, for example, there are limited ways in which we can block pain signals – such as activating opiate receptors or inhibiting prostaglandins. There are only so many ways in which you can interact with these systems. The discovery of a novel mechanism of modulating pain is therefore most welcome, and has the potential of leading to entirely new treatments that may have better side-effect profiles than existing treatments and also have additive clinical effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nn.2562.html"&gt;A recent study by Nana Goldman et. al.&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, adds to our understanding of pain relief by identifying the role of adenosine in reducing pain activity in the peripheral nervous system. The researchers, in a nice series of experiments, demonstrated that producing a local painful stimulus in mice causes the local release of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) that peaks at about 30 minutes. This correlates with a decreased pain response in the mice. Further, if drugs are given that prolong the effect of adenosine, the analgesic effect itself is prolonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if drugs are given that activate the adenosine A1 receptor, the observed analgesic effect is replicated. When these experiments are replicated in knockout mice that do not have the gene for the adenosine A1 receptor, there is no observed analgesic effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together these experiments are fairly solid evidence that local pain results in the local release of adenosine that in turn binds to the adenosine A1 receptor inhibiting the pain response. This is potentially very exciting – it should lead to further investigation of the adenosine A1 receptor and the effects of activating and inhibiting it. This may lead to the development of drugs or other interventions that activate these receptors and may ultimately be a very useful addition to our ability to treat acute and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Comes the Spin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rational science-based world, the above would be the end of this blog entry. But that is not the world we currently live in. In this study, the chosen method of provoking pain was the insertion of an acupuncture needle into the “Zusanli point” of the lower extremity and rotating it. This allowed the authors of this study to spin the results as if they were validation for acupuncture itself – and the mainstream press dutifully followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction to this study is an apology for acupuncture itself, and sets the tone for the rest of the paper as well as the press release and comments to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is a procedure in which fine needles are inserted into an individual at discrete points and then manipulated, with the intent of relieving pain. Since its development in China around 2,000 B.C., acupuncture has become worldwide in its practice. Although Western medicine has treated acupuncture with considerable skepticism, a broader worldwide population has granted it acceptance. For instance, the World Health Organization endorses acupuncture for at least two dozen conditions and the US National Institutes of Health issued a consensus statement proposing acupuncture as a therapeutic intervention for complementary medicine. Perhaps most tellingly, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved acupuncture as a deductible medical expense in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this paragraph appears in a high-impact peer-reviewed journal is very curious (to put it mildly). It is full of misinformation and logical fallacies. Acupuncture is used for more than pain relief, and so making statements about the efficacy of “acupuncture” go way beyond the scope of this study, which involves only pain. The authors should have specifically pointed out that this study cannot be used to explain any indication for acupuncture that does not involve local pain relief. Acupuncture as it was practiced in China 4,000 years ago bears little resemblance to what is practiced today, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=583"&gt;may have been more of a form a bloodletting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then make a false dichotomy between “Western medicine” and, presumably, “Eastern medicine” – which is an anti-scientific and culturally bigoted point of view. This is followed by an argument from popularity, and a particularly bizarre argument from authority – noting that the IRS accepts acupuncture as a medical expense. I was unaware that the IRS is a scientific medical organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also fail to put this study into its proper context by reviewing existing evidence – the more traditional use of the introduction to peer-reviewed research. The clinical research on acupuncture, which is quite extensive, finds that any measured symptomatic effect is almost certainly due mostly or entirely to placebo effects. Further, it does not matter where you stick the acupuncture needle, nor even if you do not stick the needle through the skin. Twisting toothpicks against the skin in random locations has the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interpretation of the research is that acupuncture (placing needles at specific acupuncture points to manipulate &lt;em&gt;chi&lt;/em&gt;) does not work. There may, however, be non-specific physiological responses to the mechanical stimulation of sticking needles at random locations, or just poking toothpicks. This study, if anything, supports this interpretation – it, in fact, has identified a local mechanism of analgesia that can help explain a non-specific response to acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or placebo acupuncture and therefore is consistent with the clinical evidence showing no difference among these interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also not the first study to identify potential local mechanisms of pain relief from mechanical stimulation. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12365644"&gt;A 2002 study&lt;/a&gt; correlated insertional activity (depolarization of muscle fibers in response to needle insertion) or electrical stimulation with pain relief. This would explain why, in this study, constant twisting of the needle was needed to provoke pain relief – perhaps insertional muscle activity is needed to release adenosine, or increases its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on what is really going on here we can best understand how to develop methods to capitalize on these local mechanisms optimally for pain relief. It must be noted, however, that needle insertion gives very unimpressive results in clinical trials. It may be that the effect is too temporary to be worthwhile, at least as mechanically provoked – pharmacologically activating the adenosine A1 receptor may be a better strategy. Also, it is very difficult to extrapolate from mouse data as the subjects are much smaller than humans, and therefore their nerves and motor end-plates (the locations where the nerves innervate the muscles) are much closer together and superficial – closer to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms are interesting, but net clinical outcomes in humans are the only kind of scientific data that really tells us if a modality works or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it has to be emphasized that this study says nothing about acupuncture itself, except for providing a possible mechanism for a non-specific local response. The term “acupuncture,” in fact, is becoming increasingly problematic and is confusing the scientific literature, not to mention the public. What is acupuncture? If we use the term broadly enough to mean any use of needles, with or without electrical stimulation, at any points, with or without skin penetration, etc. then the term is too broad to be useful. If we use the term narrowly – to mean sticking needles to a certain depth in specific acupuncture points that work through a novel mechanism specific to those locations, then we can say, based upon extensive research, that “acupuncture” does not work and its proposed underlying mechanisms are nothing more than pre-scientific superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is an excellent example of the mischief caused by confusing the non-specific use of the term “acupuncture” with its more traditional use. Research involving acupuncture in its vaguest sense is used to promote “acupuncture” in the traditional sense. This is highly deceptive and scientifically sloppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers of this current study could have used other controls to see if the effect they discovered is in any way specific to any acupuncture variables. For example – they could have used a non-acupuncture point as a control, or other forms of mechanical pain production that do not involve needles. I suspect any local pain production or mechanical trauma beyond a certain threshold would result in the same adenosine response – which certainly seems like a non-specific mechanism to modulate pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the authors did not do this, they did not actually research “acupuncture”. The description of this research in the published paper and in the press should have been as I discussed in the opening of this post. Instead, genuinely interesting research that may lead to novel pain treatments is being diverted as propaganda for an ancient superstition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a May 6 Catholic Community Conference in Washington DC, Speaker Pelosi openly touted Jesus Christ, "The Word Made Flesh", as the inspiration for her public policies.  CNS News reports a couple of her more powerful statements:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
     "And that Word," Pelosi said, "is, we have to give voice to what that means in terms of public policy that would be in keeping with the values of the Word. The Word. Isn't it a beautiful word when you think of it? It just covers everything. The Word."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
     "Fill it in with anything you want. But, of course, we know it means: 'The Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us.' And that's the great mystery of our faith. He will come again. He will come again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps most tellingly, the U.S. Internal  Revenue Service approved acupuncture as a deductible medical expense in  1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this paragraphs appears in a high impact peer-reviewed journal  is very curious (to put it mildly). It is full of misinformation and  logical fallacies. Acupuncture is used for more than pain relief, and so  making statements about the efficacy of “acupuncture” go way beyond the  scope of this study, which only involves pain. The authors should have  specifically pointed out that this study cannot be used to explain any  indication for acupuncture that does not involve local pain relief.  Acupuncture as it was practiced in China 4000 years ago bears little  resemblance to what is practiced today, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=583"&gt;may have been more of a  form a bloodletting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then make a false dichotomy  between “Western medicine” and, presumably, “Eastern medicine” – which  is an anti-scientific and culturally bigoted point of view. This is  followed by an argument from popularity, and a particularly bizarre  argument from authority – noting that the IRS accepts acupuncture as a  medical expense. I was unaware that the IRS is a scientific medical  organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors also fail to put this study into its  proper context by reviewing existing evidence – the more traditional use  of the introduction to peer-reviewed research. The clinical research on  acupuncture, which is quite extensive, finds that any measured  symptomatic effect is almost certainly due mostly or entirely to placebo  effects. Further, it does not matter where you stick the acupuncture  needle, nor even if you do stick the need through the skin. Twisting  toothpicks against the skin in random locations has the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My  interpretation of the research is that acupuncture (placing needles at  specific acupuncture points to manipulate chi) does not work. There may,  however, be non-specific physiological responses to the mechanical  stimulation of sticking needles at random locations, or just poking  toothpicks. This study, if anything, supports this interpretation – it,  if fact, has identified a local mechanism of analgesia that can help  explain a non-specific response to acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or  placebo acupuncture and therefore is consistent with the clinical  evidence showing no difference among these interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is  also not the first study to identify potential local mechanisms of pain  relief from mechanical stimulation. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12365644"&gt;A 2002 study&lt;/a&gt; correlated insertional activity (depolarization of muscle fibers in  response to needle insertion) or electrical stimulation with pain  relief. This would explain why, in this study, constant twisting of the  needle was needed to provoke pain relief – perhaps insertional muscle  activity is needed to release adenosine, or increases its release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By  focusing on what is really going on here we can best understand how to  develop methods to optimally capitalize on these local mechanisms for  pain relief. It must be noted, however, that needle insertion gives very  unimpressive results in clinical trials. It may be that the effect is  too temporary to be worthwhile, at least as mechanically provoked –  pharmacologically activating the adenosine A1 receptor may be a better  strategy. Also, it is very difficult to extrapolate from mouse data as  they are much smaller than humans, and therefore their nerves and motor  end-plates (the location where the nerves innervate the muscles) are  much closer together and superficial – closer to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms  are interesting, but net clinical outcomes in humans are the only kind  of scientific data that really tells us if a modality works or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally,  it has to be emphasized that this study says nothing about acupuncture  itself, except for providing a possible mechanism for a non-specific  local response. The term “acupuncture”, in fact, is becoming  increasingly problematic and is confusing the scientific literature, not  to mention the public. What is acupuncture? If we use the term broadly  enough to mean any use of needles, with or without electrical  stimulation, at any points, with or without skin penetration, etc. then  the term is too broad to be useful. If we use the term narrowly – to  mean sticking needles to a certain depth in specific acupuncture points  that work through a novel mechanism specific to those locations, then we  can say, based upon extensive research, that “acupuncture” does not  work and its proposed underlying mechanisms are nothing more than  pre-scientific superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study is an excellent example  of the mischief caused by confusing the non-specific use of the term  “acupuncture” with its more traditional use. Research involving  acupuncture in its vaguest sense is used to promote “acupuncture” in the  traditional sense. This is highly deceptive and scientifically sloppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  researchers of this current study could have used other controls to see  if the effect they discovered is in any way specific to any acupuncture  variables. For example – they could have used a non-acupuncture point  as a control, or other forms of mechanical pain production that do not  involve needles. I suspect any local pain production or mechanical  trauma beyond a certain threshold would result in the same adenosine  response – which certainly seems like a non-specific mechanism to  modulate pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they did not do this they did not actually  research “acupuncture”. The description of this research in the  published paper and in the press should have been as I discussed in the  opening of this post. Instead genuinely interesting research that may  lead to novel pain treatments is being diverted as propaganda for an  ancient superstition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February of 2007 &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/02/lovecraftian_horror_in_guatema_1.php"&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; about a giant sinkhole that had opened in Guatemala City. "The pit was emitting foul odors, loud noises and tremors, and a rush of water could be heard from its depths." These sinkholes are &lt;del&gt;the same kind of geological feature as&lt;/del&gt; &lt;ins&gt;similar to&lt;/ins&gt; the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote"&gt;cenotes&lt;/a&gt; into which the Maya sacrificed people, gold, jade and copal resin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now it's happened again. Last weekend a tropical storm hit Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, killing at least 115 people and causing over 100 000 to be evacuated. And in Guatemala City, another sinkhole opened, swallowing two buildings and possibly a security guard.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/books/02book.html?hpw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something  disgraceful,” George  Orwell, one of Mr. Hitchens’s literary touchstones, wrote. “A man  who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life  when viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.” Mr. Hitchens  passes this test, if only by a nose. “Hitch-22” has its share of words  like “embarrassing” and “shame”  and “misgiving.”  He is bitter about  the way the Iraq war was actually conducted.  And he ruefully admits he  has been a less than stellar father to his own children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hitch-22” is far from downbeat, however. It is packed with people —  everyone from William  Styron,  Jessica Mitford and Isaiah  Berlin to Nora Ephron,  Keith McNally and Hunter  S. Thompson, all of whom arrive attached to good anecdotes. A  generous friend, Mr. Hitchens gives most of his book’s good lines (and  there are many, a good deal of them unprintable here) to the people he  loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those good lines including this one, from Clive James, who began a  review of a Leonid Brezhnev memoir this way: “Here is a book so dull  that a whirling dervish could read himself to sleep with it…. If it  were read in the open air, birds would fall stunned from the sky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the opposite of that book is, Mr. Hitchens has written it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2010/06/01/christopher_hitchens_hitch_22_review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;God — if Hitchens will excuse my use of the term — knows that we  always need a good, hard-bitten contrarian, but something has become  skewed in Hitchens’ vision since 9/11 shifted him to the right. In an  article in October  2009 for the Atlantic, Hitchens feigned surprise at discovering  that Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Al Franken were … liberal.  “Bush’s brain or IQ,” he observes, “is enough to ignite peals of mirth  from those in Stewart’s studio crowd, who just know they are smarter  than he.” Of course, they are smarter than Bush, and Hitchens surely  knows this. He does himself and his readers no service by pretending,  even for a moment, that this isn’t true, and he pretends it for more  than 400 pages in “Hitch-22.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Hitch-22/ba-p/2697"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barnes and Nobel Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hitch-22 &lt;/em&gt;goes some distance toward answering the central  mystery about Hitchens: how, over forty years of writing and constant  on-air yakking, he has managed to continue to find issues that excite  him, and that indeed regularly summon the intensity that a normal writer  might reserve for only the most hotly contested elections, or perhaps a  particularly recriminating suicide note. He is a man of uncommonly  strong opinions about everything. The source of that energy appears to  be in those radical student days, to which the most interesting portions  of his memoir are devoted, and where he learned not only his ideology  but the rhetorical techniques that provide his livelihood, and more. “I  made a minor discovery,” he says: “If you can give a decent speech in  public or cut any sort of figure on a podium, then you need never dine  or sleep alone.” Those days appear, in his telling, to have been an  atmosphere of intense and seductive confidence. We see the young  Hitchens actively seeking out rivals to heckle in local political  meetings, hunting for censored comrades to republish and distribute, and  training in Cuba—providing a glimpse of the future of that island when  uttering counterrevolutionary thoughts of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/05/christopher-hitchens-iraq-self"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (review, called “Oedipus Wrecked,” by Terry Eagleton)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitchens is foolishly proud of having been thwacked on the bum by  Margaret Thatcher, a tale he cannot stop recounting, but then hastily  notes that he could hardly believe it was happening. He is almost as  eager to report that the “blind Yorkshire socialist and proletarian  David Blunkett” (three of the descriptive terms are accurate) observed  how a brilliant lecture by Hitchens reduced a &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; meeting  to absolute silence, but adds in a touchingly self-effacing manner that  he doesn’t remember the silence “being quite so absolute”. He feels, he  tells us, “absurdly honoured” to be grouped in the public mind with such  great scholars as Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett. “Absurdly”  because such parity is absurd, or “absurdly” because it is no more than  his due? . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one can swallow one’s vomit at some of this, there is much in the  book to enjoy. Hitchens writes with admirable seriousness and passion  about the 11 September 2001 attacks, Poland, Cuba, Iraq and a good deal  more. The old bellicose champion of human liberties and decencies is  still alive and well. There is a vastly entertaining account of London  literary life, and a chapter on the Rushdie affair that magnificently  displays all the finest qualities of a long-standing critic of autocracy  and injustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1. The baccalaureate ceremony is a privately sponsored religious event. The Tamaqua Area School District is not and will not be involved in or associated with the baccalaureate ceremony and does not or will not endorse the ceremony in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. As a public school entity, the Tamaqua Area School District does not or will not require any student to attend the baccalaureate ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The Tamaqua Area School District may not and will not provide any information regarding the date, time, location or content of the baccalaureate ceremony to the students. Such information may be provided to parents, employees or public upon specific request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. In their official capacity, Tamaqua Area School District employees are prohibited from participating in the baccalaureate ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Tamaqua Area School District employees are not required to attend the baccalaureate ceremony and will not be required to attend the ceremony in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about the graduation season that makes high school administrators so &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/25/greenwood-high-school-tries-to-circumvent-injunction-against-graduation-prayer/"&gt;ignorant&lt;/a&gt; of basic laws and high school seniors so &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/30/eric-workmans-graduation-speech/"&gt;courageous&lt;/a&gt; in response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tamaqua, PA, senior &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Miorelli&lt;/strong&gt; is a class officer at a public high school and he was told to attend &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccalaureate_service"&gt;Baccalaureate&lt;/a&gt;, a religious ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said &lt;a href="http://pahomepage.com/fulltext?nxd_id=140626"&gt;he wasn’t going&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A class officer, Miorelli said he wasn’t attending Baccalaureate. The staff member reportedly told him he would be stripped of his office if he didn’t attend. And internal school documents show the high school principal, RuthAnn Gardiner, supported that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miorelli called the ACLU and received immediate representation in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACLU first sent a letter of legal demand to the district. The documents, obtained by the I-Team, show the ACLU required the district to formally distance itself from Baccalaureate services, since they were religious in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Miorelli said he was taking heat over his decision, again, to stay clear of the church. He said things heated up after he discovered &lt;strong&gt;nomination petitions for class officers included language that required anyone elected to class office attend Baccalaureate.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is the school responding to Miorelli and the ACLU?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re claiming it was all just one big mistake… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
School Board President Larry Wittig said the nominating petition using the language that students were “required” to attend was an error, a typo.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miorelli didn’t attend the ceremony.  But the ceremony did occur, breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tamaqua Area School District is just asking for a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wonderful poetic justice if it was one of the district’s own graduates who came back to sue the district one day…&lt;/p&gt;

In my write up, I contrasted the results in M&amp;amp;W (assuming zero CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from now on) with a constant concentration scenario (roughly equivalent to an immediate cut of 70% in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions), however, as a few people pointed out in the comments, this exclusive focus on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a little artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have elsewhere been a big advocate of paying attention to the multi-faceted nature of the anthropogenic emissions (including aerosols and radiatively and chemically active short-lived species), both because that gives a &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/its-all-about-me-thane/"&gt;more useful assessment&lt;/a&gt; of what it is that we are doing that drives climate change, and also because it is vital information for &lt;a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/40528"&gt;judging the effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; of any proposed policy for a suite of public issues (climate, air pollution, public health etc.). Thus, I shouldn’t have neglected to  include these other factors in discussions of the climate change commitment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, some estimates do exist in the literature of what happens if we ceased all human emissions of climatically important factors. One such estimate is from &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/g5861615714m7381/"&gt;Hare and Meinshausen (2006)&lt;/a&gt;, whose results are illustrated here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/haremeinshausen06.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curve (1) is the result for zero emissions of all of the anthropogenic inputs (in this case, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CFCs, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, VOCs and NOx).  The conclusion is that, in the absence of any human emissions, the expectation would be for quite a sharp warming with elevated temperatures lasting almost until 2050. The reason is that the reflective aerosols (sulphates) decrease in abundance very quickly and so their cooling effect is removed faster than the warming impact of the well-mixed GHGs disappears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calculation is done with a somewhat simplified model, and so it might be a little different with a more state-of-the-art ESM (for instance, including more aerosol species like black carbon and a more complete interaction between the chemistry and aerosol species), but the basic result is likely to be robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is not a realistic scenario for anything that could really happen, but it does illustrate a couple of points that are relevant for policy. Firstly, the full emissions profile of any particular activity or sector needs to be considered – exclusively focusing on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; might give a misleading picture of the climate impact. Secondly, timescales are important.  The shorter the time horizon, the larger the impact of short-lived species (aerosols, ozone, etc.). However, the short-lived species provide both warming and cooling effects and the balance between them will vary depending on the activity. Good initial targets for policy measures to reduce emissions might therefore be those where both the short and long-lived components increase warming.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275473900038"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=3937">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2175feef239527f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="announcements"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="vaccination"/><category term="anti-vax lobby"/><category term="Australian Vaccination Network"/><category term="flu vaccine"/><category term="information for parents"/><category term="Medicare"/><category term="Meryl Dorey"/><category term="WA health"/><title type="html">The AVN WA library lecture becomes a political bun fight where kids are the losers</title><published>2010-06-02T10:06:45Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T10:06:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/06/02/the-avn-wa-library-lecture-becomes-a-political-bun-fight-but-who-wins/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night the State Library of Western Australia hosted the AVN on their premises, for the purposes of spreading bountiful misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—-&lt;br&gt;
Dear Margaret Allen, If you do read this, please follow this &lt;a href="http://www.antivaxxers.com/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to see the nature of the AVN’s material. As a librarian of experience, I expect you have researched this group prior to agreeing to host them. If not, and I understand you are very busy, then it might be of interest.&lt;br&gt;
—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done to Margaret Allen, CEO of the library, who was apparently responsible for this lapse in judgement and now has the dubious honour of putting the health of WA children at &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/05/02/flu-reactions-bad-batch-ruled-out-the-search-for-the-cause-continues/"&gt;further risk&lt;/a&gt;. I hope she is pleased with her decision to host a “controversial” group that is the AVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message to Margaret Allen: there is nothing “controversial” about vaccines, except that which exists in the minds of the anti-vaxers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 200 people attended the event, including the brave sceptics @podblack, @luminousmonkey and @danbuzzard who live tweeted and blogged the event. (They must have stronger stomachs than do I). If you want to follow the course of events as they unfolded you can search twitter for the hashtag #stopAVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminar itself featured a talk from PhD candidate Judy Wilyman from Murdoch University Perth and Meryl Dorey, media spokesperson (and immediate past president) for the AVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a history to this talk – it is the second time the AVN have scheduled a public lecture in Perth in recent weeks. The first time, their booking was &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/05/13/uniting-church-cancels-venue-access-to-avn-for-perth-seminar/"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; at the eleventh hour owing to the Uniting Church in the City (responsibly) deeming that hosting the AVN was not within their charter and ethos and “..&lt;a href="http://www.perthunitingchurch.com.au/viewStory/What%27s+Happening"&gt;there may be a public perception that the Church does not support childhood vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Meryl, she was informed of the decision as she was about to board a plane to Perth from the Gold Coast, and was forced to forfeit her airfare and return home with her tail between her legs. What a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the library assured Meryl they would not repeat such a cancellation. And so they kept their promise with Margaret Allen responding to emails of complaint with the same form response;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“The State Library of Western Australia provides facilities and services to the community of Western Australia as a whole; inevitably from time to time this may include interest groups with views that some may find controversial.&lt;br&gt;
.
&lt;p&gt;The State Library does not make any judgment about individuals, groups or organizations, unless there is a clear breach of law, policies or procedures, in which case we may act to exclude clients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally called the WA Dept of Health to ask them to explain themselves, but was informed that the matter had been passed to the Minister for the Arts and Culture since the majority of complaints pertaining to the event, were about the use of a state tax-payer funded facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was apparently out of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they should have made it their job to put a stop to this, and I informed them of such (I am not shy), but despite them agreeing with all my points about the AVN, they sat on their hands. They did however have a meeting with Meryl Dorey and Judy Wilyman the evening prior to the event, which I was told was a routine event offered to anyone requesting so. I imagine Meryl taught them much about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m certain the head of the Immunisation Programme for WA Health, Dr Paul Effler can’t possibly know as much as someone touted as “&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/01/05/a-lesson-in-the-importance-of-unbiased-proof-reading/"&gt;Australia’s Leading Expert in Vaccination&lt;/a&gt;” whose qualifications are a “brain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because of the current government departments sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yunSRfnsVck"&gt;TROLOLOLOLOL&lt;/a&gt;” the Shadow minister for Culture and the Arts, John Hyde got mad. I don’t know if he knows the AVN’s work, but he was quoted in a West Australian newspaper article entitled “&lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7323001/anti-vaccine-forum-causes-row/1/asc/26945/#thread"&gt;Anti-vaccine forum causes row&lt;/a&gt;” saying the Barnett Government had opened the floodgates for any group to use the library’s facilities to push  their agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Does this mean that the Liberal Party can hold a membership drive there, or for that matter the Ku Klux Klan or a bike gang?&lt;/em&gt;” Mr Hyde said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Why should a group that endangers the lives of WA children be allowed to speak and promote their cause at a taxpayer-funded venue dedicated to learning?&lt;/em&gt;” Mr Hyde said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also informed a colleague in a personal communication that he would be asking Ms Allen and the Minister to explain their policies with respect to allowing groups like the AVN free rein of State funded facilities in parliament today. I look forward to hearing their explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel 7 news &lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/video/national/watch/20122777/885679/"&gt;reported the story &lt;/a&gt;where Mr Hyde said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Our state library shouldn’t be subsidising or promoting propaganda that puts the lives of our children at risk.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Fiona Stanley was less polite, simply stating: “&lt;em&gt;This misinformation will lead to the deaths of children.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for CEO Ms Allen, the resident sceptics last night reported that Channel 7 was forbidden from filming inside the venue and that this was at the request of Ms Allen, not the AVN. It seems strange to me that Ms Allen is happy to host “controversial” groups, but doesn’t want anyone to know what they say. Either way, she now has a lot of explaining to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweets such as this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hey @statelibrarywa good job on hosting an anti-vaxer and HIV/AIDS denier. Australia’s children thank you #stopAVN #FAIL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very nice of AVN to talk about  free choice, sorry, if your choice means a child dies, you don’t get to  be free on that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;were appearing all over their twitter page last night as the seminar progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the event and because of the previous last minute cancellation,  Meryl was constantly screeching about “free speech” and democracy. Well, I want to  be free to say “I HAVE A BOMB” on a plane, but for sake of public safety I wouldn’t, I can’t and I don’t. Much the same as yelling “FIRE!” in a crowded cinema when there is no fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile a &lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7305739/child-vaccination-rates-plunge/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; which appeared in the West Australian last week claimed that more WA parents were opting out of vaccinating their children, with the number of youngsters not fully immunised in the national program doubling over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to the Dept of Health this report was exaggerated. Medicare figures show WA has the lowest rate of childhood vaccinations in the country for children aged 12 to 15 months, but only by 0.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The percentage of children 12-15 months of age (age calculated at 31 December 2009) assessed as fully immunised. Date of processing 31 March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT 92.8%, VIC 92.0, QLD 91.5%, SA 90.6%, &lt;strong&gt;WA 89.2%&lt;/strong&gt;, TAS 93.0%, NT 89.4%, AUS 91.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the percentage of children 24-27 months of age (age calculated at 31  December 2009) assessed as fully immunised is lower by a difference of 2.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACT 93.9%, VIC 92.3, QLD 92.6%, SA 91.6%, &lt;strong&gt;WA 89.9%&lt;/strong&gt;, TAS 93.5%, NT 92.0%, AUS 92.0%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And according to Dr Paul Effler, the medical co-ordinator of the immunisation program in WA, the state is consistently lower than the rest of the country largely because the State had the fewest GPs, who give 63 per cent of immunisations, per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll bet you can’t guess where the lowest rates of immunisation nationally might fall. Go on, guess. And here’s a clue, the  AVN are based in Bangalow, an area know as the Northern Rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the most recent Medicare figures reporting the rankings for Divisions of General Practice in descending order based on immunisation coverage rates calculated from the General Practice Immunisation Incentives scheme. Rated for the May quarter 2010, from 1 (first) – (last) 113.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;113. NORTHERN RIVERS GENERAL PRACTICE NETWORK 79.6%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a coincidence that this is the region where the AVN are based? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Meryl Dorey and the AVN for campaigning hard and long, and succeeding in discouraging parents from vaccinating their children. First place in the lowest vax uptake in the country is nothing to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And congratulations must also go to the WA government for allowing this dangerous group to spew their “controversial” BS all the way to Perth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what will be the prize? Mumps, whooping cough, pick your favourite communicable disease. They’re all in the running now.&lt;/p&gt;

We adorn our homes with paraphernalia caught in the net of life - the photos, the books and pictures. But what happens when you&amp;#39;re homeless? How do you define your space and identity when your home is a public place? To find out, Darrin Hodgetts and colleagues have conducted an unusual &amp;#39;ethnographic&amp;#39; case study with &amp;#39;Brett&amp;#39;, a 44-year-old homeless man in Auckland.The researchers gave Brett a camera, asked him to take photos representative of his life and then they conducted two in-depth interviews with him, using the photos as spring-boards for discussion.The clearest finding to emerge was the way that Brett used a portable radio to insulate himself from the outside world - what the researchers called an &amp;#39;audio cave&amp;#39;. &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve got a sound bubble around me,&amp;#39; Brett said, &amp;#39;and I can wander through the streets without paying attention to what&amp;#39;s going on around me.&amp;#39; At the same time, by consistently listening to his favourite station George FM, Brett was able to develop a sense of belonging with the station&amp;#39;s other listeners. This provided Brett with a &amp;#39;fleeting sense of companionship and &amp;quot;we-ness&amp;quot;,&amp;#39; the researchers said.Brett is a self-confessed loner who avoids contact with other people where possible and who tries to conceal his homeless status. He told the researchers about the places he went that enabled him to do this, including a former gun emplacement with stunning views of the sea; Judges Bay where there are free showers and gas barbecues; and in the city centre, the church, bookshops and libraries. These places allow Brett to experience &amp;#39;life as a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; person who has interest in books and reading, or simply escaping the city to sit and reflect,&amp;#39; the researchers said. By contrast, returning to photograph the public toilets on Pitt Street was an ordeal for Brett, reminding him of this time as a drug addict.Brett referred to how other homeless people spend a lot of time sitting round talking and how it [homelessness] psychologically unhinges them. By contrast, the researchers said Brett had never &amp;#39;lost himself&amp;#39; to the streets. &amp;#39;...[H]is memories, imagination, and daily practices, including his use of space, provide anchorage to an adaptive sense of self and belonging.&amp;#39;  _________________________________Hodgetts D, Stolte O, Chamberlain K, Radley A, Groot S, &amp;amp; Nikora LW (2010).

It's kind of in the nature of an eating disorder that there aren't any really funny pictures or something that Sci can put in here.

Apparently, tonight he has learned that &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/penis-fracture/an01217"&gt;it is possible to fracture your penis&lt;/a&gt;.  He is now completely obsessed with this.  I suspect that I am going to have to hear many hours worth of discourse on the penile fracture.&lt;/p&gt;

The top panel is an MRI of a normal, erect penis.  The bottom panel contains a broken penis.  If you squint, that penis has a sad face. :(  Here is the &lt;a href="http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/20/5/1397.full"&gt;source of those penises&lt;/a&gt;. I will bet $500 that the normal penis belongs to the author.  Isn't it some kind of dude fantasy to publish one's penis?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, before the discussion of broken phalluses (phalli?) began, I received the following email:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mighty Isis wrote&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"My blogroll has gotten too big for the regular sidebar!

I do, and I really want to like Geek Mommy Prof.  I really want more women scientists to blog and to be positive role models.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the problem.  I have learned over the last two years in the science blogosphere that being a feminist and an advocate for minorities are not necessarily coupled. Sometimes my feminist colleagues and allies still need a little help to ensure that they don&amp;#39;t end up playing racial bingo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/racial%20bingo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="racial bingo.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/06/racial%20bingo-thumb-400x404-50321.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="400" height="404"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: Dr. Isis&amp;#39;s racial bingo card.  Click to embiggen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Geek Mommy Prof sent me her email, I clicked over to her blog to check it out.  Today&amp;#39;s post is entitled: &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://geekmommyprof.blogspot.com/2010/06/cultural-diversity-in-research-lab.html"&gt;Cultural 
Diversity in a Research Lab&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.  &lt;span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;color:black;font-weight:bold;vertical-align:baseline"&gt;¡&lt;/span&gt;Mi corazón! &lt;span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;color:black;font-weight:bold;vertical-align:baseline"&gt;¿&lt;/span&gt;Alguien mas que piensa en la diversidad?  Then I began to read.  My interest was initially piqued when I read...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For instance, occasionally I will have 2 or 3 people from the same country, and 
they tend to speak in their native language when at work, which excludes others 
from the conversation. Since conversations in the lab are first and foremost 
supposed to be work-related, and since the language of instruction at the 
University is English, I now explicitly require that all the conversations in 
the lab or office be in English. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has friends and collaborators who hail from the same region as some members of my family, this was interesting to me.  Sometimes when we&amp;#39;re together I speak to them in Spanish.   I also share a language with many members of the janitorial staff at MRU and will converse with them &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"&gt;en &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"&gt;español&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;I know that this occasionally makes the white folk feel antsy (Heaven forbid they think we are talking about them. Or, God forbid, plotting to storm their border), so I was willing to not blow this one out of proportion (see racial bingo above).  But, then I read this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are also some amusing (at least in hindsight) aspects of cultural 
diversity. For instance, some of my lab/office rules now include explicit 
instructions on proper food storage (e.g. food should be stored in the fridge 
and not left out to rot on one's desk for days) and hygienic habits (frequent 
showers and washing laundry). This sounds silly, but I have had more than one 
occasion of a student with a strong body odor, where the smell was so strong 
that it would disrupt the work of others to the point of them avoiding to come 
to the lab after complaining in vain. Not only am I now well versed in 
conversing about someone being stinky, I have had to occasionally do it more 
than once, and in one case, after repeated conversations, I had to threaten 
termination of research assistantship unless the situation improved (it did). On 
more than one occasion, I have also talked with students about laundry issues 
such as fabric softener choice, and I once researched Al-free deodorant for a 
student who would not use any deodorant for fear of cancer. I remember thinking 
whether this was really part of my job description as their research advisor, 
but I suppose it is, because I see no one else volunteering...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it just sounded like this...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/foreign%20grad%20student.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="foreign grad student.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/06/foreign%20grad%20student-thumb-400x531-50325.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="400" height="531"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: Behold the foreign graduate student.  Unbathed, surrounded by piles of rotting food, jibbering in his native tongue...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We&amp;#39;ve all had smelly people in our lives - white, brown, or otherwise.  Most of us grow up and deal with it.  Some of us have coworkers who leave food around shared spaces and forget to clean up after themselves.  I will admit that it is usually me.  I am also the one who drinks the last Diet Pepsi from the fridge and doesn&amp;#39;t replace it.  Lo siento, cabrones.  But, conflating all of these issues in a post about cultural diversity made me imagine this...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/posh%20tea.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="posh tea.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/06/posh%20tea-thumb-340x270-50327.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="340" height="270"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 4: And if you can manage to break the brown people of their savage ways, you can certainly mold them into good scientists.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I need to believe, como la diosa de laboratorio y casa, La Gran Dra. Isis, that this is not how Geek Mommy Prof wanted me to read this. I need to believe that we can have a deeper conversation about incorporating foreign and minority students into academia.  One that extends beyond language and showers.  A conversation that begins to discuss how we can encourage individuals of different backgrounds to interact, how we can encourage scientists to exchange languages, and how we can create a shared culture that accepts the differences between us.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, Geek Mommy Prof is a new blog, only 10 posts old, and I can only hope that this is her making her foot-in-mouth mistakes early.  I am going to give Geek Mommy Prof a week or two to keep developing here bloggy chops and then I&amp;#39;ll check back with her.  The blogosphere needs more academic women bloggers and I think she may develop into a blogger with some valuable insights.  I&amp;#39;ll let you know what I find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless Mr. Isis fractures his penis.  Then all bets are off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/06/blogrolling_on_probation-_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/mmNJkCnFDBU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275458684472"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/jhCrT/~3/mYP7Wgh8Ta4/metasim-metagenome-sequence-simulators.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55f5a2507f612bb4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Metagenome Sequence Simulators</title><published>2010-06-02T00:56:52Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T00:56:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/7TrF2Hl13To/metasim-metagenome-sequence-simulators.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/jhCrT/~3/mYP7Wgh8Ta4/metasim-metagenome-sequence-simulators.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Richter DC, Ott F, Auch AF, Schmid R, &amp;amp; Huson DH (2008).

PloS one, 3 (10) PMID: 18841204An article from the Huson&amp;#39;s Group at Tübingen University has just came out in the Open Access (and scientific publishing innovator) journal PLoS ONE, describing MetaSim, a software to produce artificial or syntetic or in silico metagenomes out of a selection of completely sequenced genomes.This is just &amp;quot;heaven-sent&amp;quot; for me since I&amp;#39;ve been working on a set of syntetic metagenomes for the past two months, and will be happy to use this software first hand like... today. It seems that the software not only lets you choose the source genomes from a phylogenetic tree (figures reproduced here from the original article al PLoS ONE thanks to the Creative Commons License), but also choose from three different type of sequencing technology output (Sanger, 454 and Illumina) and generate theorethical metagenome. This is the continuation of a very important change in genomic sciences, moving from experiments far too expensive or long to be replicated and hence out of hard statistical comparision, to null-model based in silico genomic analysis.The first effort to analyze the true scope of metagenomic analysis was presented by Kostas Mavrommatis and others from the Genome Biology group at JGI (unfortunately published in an non-OA journal), where they produced three simulated metagenomes of contrasting complexity to asses assembly, gene prediction and annotation (SPOILER: the best combination assesed was Arachne assembler with Fgenesb predictor and PhyloPhytia for binning, and BLAST &amp;quot;performed poorly&amp;quot; as usual).  This work also produced a database for the Fidelity of Analysis of Metagenomic Samples (FAMeS), a great effort to standarize metagenomic analysis software. A great alternative is ProxyGene annotation, as reported by the Markowitz group.Mavromatis K, Ivanova N, Barry K, Shapiro H, Goltsman E, McHardy AC, Rigoutsos I, Salamov A, Korzeniewski F, Land M, Lapidus A, Grigoriev I, Richardson P, Hugenholtz P, &amp;amp; Kyrpides NC (2007).

The point is that metagenomics is sometimes being overselled just in the very same way as genomics has been (see Eisen&amp;#39;s blog for just some examples) and this leads to an skeptic counterwave.My brief cons and pros:a) metagenomics offers indeed the unprecedented opportunity to explore unculturable microbial diversity, which no other tool can do.b) metagenomics is not only a technological advance like genomics was, it fits perfectly in an ecological (community/ecosystemic) theoretical backgroundc) no matter what everybody says, the GOS sampling has provided an incredible amount of data on previously unknown (and often unimagined) microbial diversityd) criticisms on the amount of money spent on metagenomics seem to me like questioning the financial support on Humboldt&amp;#39;s (or any other naturalist) voyages, which were explorative and not precisely focused on any hypothesis.e) metagenomics is obviously  error-prone, and it&amp;#39;s biases have been poorly evaluatedf) metagenomics is much more useful in small, simple communities where a reasonable coverage can be achievedg) metagenomics is much more useful in well known, deeply studied natural communities where it is employed to answer specific biological questionsh) metagenomics is expensive!i) a great deal of work is still to be done on: defining parameters for comparing different samples, assessing taxonomical and functional biases, increasing assembly effectiveness and contig construction, improving functional prediction, developing tools for the analysis of such huge datasets, etc.j) metagenomics is best when interdisciplinary, that is when it&amp;#39;s used along with techniques and analyses from other disciplines that might provide physiological, evolutionary or ecological informationThat being said, metagenomics rocks!Rusch DB, Halpern AL, Sutton G, Heidelberg KB, Williamson S, Yooseph S, Wu D, Eisen JA, Hoffman JM, Remington K, Beeson K, Tran B, Smith H, Baden-Tillson H, Stewart C, Thorpe J, Freeman J, Andrews-Pfannkoch C, Venter JE, Li K, Kravitz S, Heidelberg JF, Utterback T, Rogers YH, Falcón LI, Souza V, Bonilla-Rosso G, Eguiarte LE, Karl DM, Sathyendranath S, Platt T, Bermingham E, Gallardo V, Tamayo-Castillo G, Ferrari MR, Strausberg RL, Nealson K, Friedman R, Frazier M, &amp;amp; Venter JC (2007).

One bit of the copious evidence that belies the claim is the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/age_of_autism_and_gardasil_whats_that_ag.php"&gt;obsessive focus of that blog on Gardasil&lt;/a&gt;. Even if science hadn't failed time and time again to find a link between vaccines and autism, even in the most fevered dreams of anti-vaccine zealots Gardasil couldn't have anything to do with autism because it is usually administered when a girl is between 10-13, long past the age when autism is most commonly diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is the meningococcal vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why, then, is Age of Autism going crazy about a proposed vaccine mandate for the meningococcal vaccine to be required before children enter seventh grade? See what they're &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/action-alert-ny-to-mandate-meningitis-vaccine-for-7th-graders.html"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Urgent Calls &amp;amp; Faxes Needed Tomorrow, Tuesday, June 1st to
STOP new meningitis shot mandate for 7th graders in NY and to oppose Assembly Bill 10313 and Senate Bill 7156.
  
Tomorrow, Tuesday, June 1, 2010 you need to get in the car and come to Albany to stop an effort to sneak through yet another mandatory vaccine in New York, this time for the meningitis vaccine, for both seventh graders and college students. If you can&amp;#39;t make it to Albany get on the phone, fax, and click on the Take Action link above to send your legislators an email and tell your legislators to fix state government and fix the $9 billion+ deficit and pass decent autism health insurance reform rather than interfere with your families&amp;#39; health decisions.

&lt;p&gt;No other state, or country requires, adolescents to get this shot. Only two states, New Jersey and Connecticut require it for college students, and that's only for students who live in dormitories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="http://vaccineinfo.net/alerts/StopMeningococcalVaccineMandateinNY.shtml"&gt;anti-vaccine groups are joining the bandwagon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, what was that about Age of Autism not being "anti-vaccine"? If it's not anti-vaccine, why the obssessive focus on Gardasil and now the rabid reaction to a meningococcal vaccine mandate for seventh graders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's because when Age of Autism bloggers proclaim that they're "not anti-vaccine," they're either lying or fooling themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/age_of_autism_and_vaccination_against_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/QyABPy8dXig" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275449256658"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_98.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a4103548263e722</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS this week</title><published>2010-06-02T01:25:58Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T01:25:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/GWcRE4fBCDs/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_98.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_98.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000385" title=""&gt;Distorted Views of Biodiversity: Spatial and Temporal Bias in Species Occurrence Data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Historical as well as current data on species distributions are needed to track changes in biodiversity. Species distribution data are found in a variety of sources but it is likely that they include different biases towards certain time periods or places. By collating a large historical database of ~170,000 records of species in the avian order Galliformes, dating back over two centuries and covering Europe and Asia, we investigate patterns of spatial and temporal bias in five sources of species distribution data: museum collections, scientific literature, ringing records, ornithological atlases, and website reports from "citizen scientists." Museum data were found to provide the most comprehensive historical coverage of species' ranges but often proved extremely time-intensive to collect. Literature records have increased in their number and coverage through time, whereas ringing, atlas, and website data are almost exclusively restricted to the last few decades. Geographically, our data were biased towards Western Europe and Southeast Asia. Museums were the only data source to provide reasonably even spatial coverage across the entire study region. In the last three decades, literature data have become increasingly focussed towards threatened species and protected areas, and currently no source is providing reliable baseline information--a role once filled by museum collections. As well as securing historical data for the future and making it available for users, the sampling biases will need to be understood and addressed if we are to obtain a true picture of biodiversity change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000271" title=""&gt;Secondary Prevention of Suicide&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suicide prevention can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary suicide prevention aims to reduce the number of new cases of suicide in the general population [5]. Secondary suicide prevention aims to decrease the likelihood of a suicide attempt in high-risk patients [5]. Tertiary suicide prevention occurs in response to completed suicides and attempts to diminish suicide contagion (clusters of suicides in a geographical area that occur predominantly among teenagers and young adults) and copy-cat suicides [5],[6].

&lt;p&gt;Secondary suicide prevention is particularly important but not always given the attention that it deserves, in part because research into secondary prevention is only just starting to be applied to clinical practice. In this article, we discuss recent research on the evaluation of suicidal risk and on different kinds of secondary suicide prevention interventions that aim to reduce that risk. We also indicate how these interventions are currently being applied and what additional research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010912" title=""&gt;Multi-Way Multi-Group Segregation and Diversity Indices&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we compute a segregation or diversity index from a three-way or multi-way contingency table, where each variable can take on an arbitrary finite number of values and where the index takes values between zero and one? Previous methods only exist for two-way contingency tables or dichotomous variables. A prototypical three-way case is the segregation index of a set of industries or departments given multiple explanatory variables of both sex and race. This can be further extended to other variables, such as disability, number of years of education, and former military service. We extend existing segregation indices based on Euclidean distance (square of coefficient of variation) and Boltzmann/Shannon/Theil index from two-way to multi-way contingency tables by including multiple summations. We provide several biological applications, such as indices for age polyethism and linkage disequilibrium. We also provide a new heuristic conceptualization of entropy-based indices. Higher order association measures are often independent of lower order ones, hence an overall segregation or diversity index should be the arithmetic mean of the normalized association measures at all orders. These methods are applicable when individuals self-identify as multiple races or even multiple sexes and when individuals work part-time in multiple industries. The policy implications of this work are enormous, allowing people to rigorously test whether employment or biological diversity has changed.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_98.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/GWcRE4fBCDs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275449256658"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/whaling_-_politics_science_eth.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72191b3d6c03fa1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><title type="html">Whaling - Politics, Science &amp;amp; Ethics</title><published>2010-06-02T01:20:26Z</published><updated>2010-06-02T01:20:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Gp0KHHEr5xI/whaling_-_politics_science_eth.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/whaling_-_politics_science_eth.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/forum/whale-whaling-moratorium-stephen-palumbi/" title=""&gt;new forum at PRI World Science&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Listen to a story by reporter Eric Niiler, followed by our interview with Stephen Palumbi.

&lt;p&gt;Our guest in the Science Forum is marine biologist Stephen Palumbi of Stanford University. He uses genetics to study whale populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Whaling Commission is considering legalizing commercial whaling by some countries, but at a very limited scale. Palumbi says that the current proposal would fail to protect endangered whale species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can ask Palumbi your own questions. Join the conversation. It's just to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Do you think all whaling should be banned? Why?&lt;br&gt;

In 1958, it was the founding tenant of North Carolina's Research Triangle Park. Today it's one of the largest research institutes on the planet.

&lt;p&gt;At 5:30 pm on Tuesday, June 8, RTI will welcome SCONC members to its 180-acre campus to learn about efforts to solve one of the world's most pressing challenges: the need to reengineer our energy use. Come and learn about efforts to create fuel from biomass, to remove sulfur and other bad actors from coal combustion and to use nanotechnology to develop more efficient lighting systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTI will provide refreshments. We'll meet in the Johnson Science and Engineering Building, # 23 on this map:&lt;br&gt;
http://www.rti.org/pubs/rti_international_maps.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directions to RTI are here:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special note to non-U.S. citizens: RSVP right away so RTI can get you on a special "approved" list. Everyone else: if you can come, email Cathy Clabby by Monday June 7 at cclabby@amsci.org.&lt;/p&gt;

This is known as Darwin&amp;#39;s Naturalization Hypothesis, and his logic was that among close relatives, where ecological requirements should be most similar, the struggle for existence is most severe. Thus the modern formulation is that invader success is influenced by the amount of time since two species shared a common ancestor (usually called phylogenetic distance). Tests of this hypothesis have been primarily done on large species inventories, with results from different studies either supporting or refuting it. In a new study by Lin Jiang and colleagues published in the American Naturalist, they cleverly use bacteria with known relatedness to test this hypothesis.They used four species of bacteria: Bacillus pumilus, B. cereus, Frigoribacterium sp. and Serratia marcescens as residents in every possible 1, 2, 3 and 4-species communities and invaded them with a subspecies of S. marcescens. What they found was that the invader density was highly significantly related to phylogenetic distance, so that the invader reached its greatest density when communities contained only distantly-related species.Though these types of laboratory experiments are simplistic (I too use these systems), they offer insights into particular mechanisms, which may otherwise be difficult to detect in noisier systems.Jiang, L., Tan, J., &amp;amp; Pu, Z.

Actually, if you are in the US I should ask "Have you ever NOT bought a cell phone in such a place?" (In at least some other countries they don't make the process so religious and obnoxious.  You just go into Woolworth's or something and get your phone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm looking forward to the prospect of &lt;a href="http://wireless.amazon.com/?tag=wwwgregladenc-20"&gt;getting my next cell phone at Amazon.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the site, the main objective is to make buying/upgrading/etc "easier."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service appears to handle at least three carriers including Verizon (good for me, because that's the one that works at the cabin). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can get a Motorola Droid for about 20 bucks with a new account, but it goes up to 130 bucks if I admit I already have a phone.  Or, if I just keep everything I have the same but replace my current phone with the Droid, it will only cost me .. 530 dollars! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday, there will be a revolution.      &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/06/you_can_get_your_next_cell_pho.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/m33YK68vtLw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275442236618"><id gr:original-id="http://lifeinthefastlane.com/2010/06/toxicology-conundrum-036/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a714e702a28b09ec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Seafood poisoning</title><published>2010-06-01T20:42:37Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T20:42:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/eRAzKRWQscY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://lifeinthefastlane.com/2010/06/toxicology-conundrum-036/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A couple present to the ED with vomiting and paraesthesiae after eating at a seafood restaurant.

At least they know I am honest, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving a seminar that is usually held on a Friday afternoon to a Tuesday afternoon is a really crappy thing to do.  My brain wants to think that it is the weekend and turn itself off for two days.  This would be heroically unproductive.  It might, however, keep me from running my mouth during a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn it.&lt;/p&gt;

Staying cool might seem like a universal “do”, but air-conditioning stirs up a surprising debate within offices and households this time of year. Some prefer to blast it and sleep under a lofty comforter, some prefer not to use it at all, and some swear it makes them sick to work in an air conditioned office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to know what you do in the heat of summer: Do you sweat it out, or turn on the A/C? &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European stereotypes practically revolve around slowly-smoked cigarettes and smoky cafes, but it turns out their smoking habits actually may be healthier than ours. Americans are getting a higher dose of the most deadly carcinogens in cigarettes, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. American cigs are made from “American blend” tobacco, which contains higher levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines because of growing and curing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may be tempting to get your pen-pal across the Atlantic to send you care packages full of less-toxic British cigarettes, we suggest you use this as yet &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/smoking-and-birth-control-daily-health-quiz/"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-stop-smoking-right-now/"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; to kick the habit for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BABloggee Alereon (and many others) sent me to an interesting site: &lt;a href="http://www.doomers.us/forum2/index.php/topic,68213.0.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Life After the Oil Crash Forum&lt;/a&gt; —  a forum that apparently has a lot of doomsday-type scuttlebutt posted to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anonymous poster there says he has heard that the star Betelgeuse is about to go supernova, maybe as soon as a few weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was talking to my son last week (he works on Mauna Kea), and he mentioned some new observations (that will no doubt get published eventually) of “Beetlejuice”;  it’s no longer round.  This is a huge star, and when it goes, it will be at least as bright as that 1054 supernova…except that this one is 520 light years away, not 6,300 [...]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it collapses, it will be at least as bright as the full moon, and maybe as bright as the sun.  For six weeks.  So the really lucky folks (for whom Betelgeuse is only visible at night) will get 24 hour days, everybody else will get at least some time with two suns in the sky.  The extra hour of light from daylight savings time won’t burn the crops, but this might.  Probably, all we’ll get is visible light (not gamma rays or X-rays), so it shouldn’t be an ELE.  It’s sure gonna freak everyone out, though…..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it will form a black hole, but we’re too far away for that to matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buzz is that this is weeks/months away, not the “any time in the next thousand years” that’s in all the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basic takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, folks, first: when news like this comes from an unnamed source on some random forum, and that source is not even a primary one, and that secondary source quoted is also unnamed, and that person heard it from a &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; party that is also unnamed… well, oddly enough my skeptic alarm bell in my head rings loudly enough that my eardrums explode outward in every direction at the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I’m being clear here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first important thing to note here is that if Betelgeuse explodes, we’re in no danger at all. &lt;strong&gt;It’s too far away to hurt us.&lt;/strong&gt; Got that? It’s the most important thing to remember here, because I’m quite sure this story will get wildly exaggerated as it gets repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the deal with Betelgeuse? What is it, will it explode, and if so, when?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betelgeuse is one of the brightest stars in the sky. That’s because it’s an intrinsically luminous star, and one that’s relatively close by. By luminous, I mean something like 100,000 times that of the Sun, and by close I mean roughly 600 light years away if not more. That’s 6 quadrillion kilometers, or almost 4 quadrillion miles. In other words, quite a hike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betelgeuse is a red supergiant. It has a mass of something like 20 times the Sun’s, and is near the end of its life. When it dies, it will explode as a supernova, a titanic event that is among the most violent in the Universe. For details on how this happens, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/sn87a_explosion.html"&gt;read this essay I wrote about it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know just when a star will explode when you’re on the outside. Betelgeuse might go up tonight, or it might not be for 100,000 years. We’re just not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betelgeuse isn’t round, and it’s shrinking!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bulletin board post, he talks about the star not being round. It’s unclear, &lt;a href="http://astronomynow.com/news/n0907/29betel/"&gt;but it sounds like he’s referring to observations&lt;/a&gt; which show that there is a big plume coming from the surface of Betelgeuse. That was exciting news when it was released, but not hugely surprising; stars are active, and massive stars even more so.  Also, note that those &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; observations are a year old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/04/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/06/hst_betelgeuse.jpg" alt="hst_betelgeuse" title="hst_betelgeuse" width="610" height="419"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That image above is from even earlier, and shows a Hubble observation of Betelgeuse taken in 2005. Note here that the star doesn’t look round, but that’s an illusion. The image shows a hot spot in Betelgeuse’s swollen atmosphere, and that makes it look like a bump is hanging of the side. In reality, that’s just because of the way the image is printed, and isn’t an actual physical bump. But the hot spot (probably due to a big ol’ bubble of hot gas rising near the surface) in itself shows that things on the star change all the time; just recently &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/12/spotting-betelgeuse/"&gt;two such spots were found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post also talks about Betelgeuse shrinking. That claim is from &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17282-betelgeuse-the-incredible-shrinking-star.html"&gt;observations made over the course of many years&lt;/a&gt;. Those data indicate the star is shrinking, but it’s unclear what they mean. While it may mean the star is in fact shrinking, starspots (sunspots on another star) &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/12/spotting-betelgeuse/"&gt;may be fooling us&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Also, red supergiants aren’t like marbles, with a clean, sharp surface. They are balls of gas, extended and bloated, so there is no real surface. It’s therefore entirely possible the astronomers aren’t even really measuring the surface of the star at all, and it’s just the highly extended atmosphere that’s changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface tension, rotten to the core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I’m making is that a lot of stuff can happen on the surface of the star that has nothing to do with the core. Since it’s the core that generates the star’s energy and &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/sn87a_explosion.html"&gt;eventually causes it to explode&lt;/a&gt;, what’s happening on the surface is not an indication of any impending explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, the surface and the core do &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; to each other, though slowly. As the core changes, that information does leak to the surface, but it takes centuries. Until, that is, the core collapses. When that happens, the shock wave takes hours or days to get to the surface, and the star explodes. But that’s hardly a slow event taking decades! So any changes we see happening now probably have little to do with what’s happening hundreds of millions of kilometers deep in the star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s been known for a long time that Betelgeuse is a variable star; its light output changes. This shrinking may just be a part of that natural cycle, and again no indication of an explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, I’ll note that someday, Betelgeuse &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; explode. That’s for certain! But it’s also way too far away to hurt us. A supernova has to be no farther than about 25 light years away to be able to fry us with light or anything else, and Betelgeuse is 25 times that distance (which means its power to hurt us is weakened by over 600x). It’s the wrong kind of star to explode as &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/04/28/new-burst-vaporizes-cosmic-distance-record/"&gt;a gamma-ray burst&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m not worried about that either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that distance, it’ll get bright, about as bright as the full Moon. That’s pretty bright! It’ll hurt your eyes to look at it, but that’s about it. The original post says it may get as bright as the Sun, but that’s &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; wrong. It won’t even get 1/100,000th that bright. Still bright, but it’s not going to cook us. Even if it were going to explode soon. Which it almost certainly isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my personal opinion is that this is just another breathless rumor of astronomical doomsday that we get every couple of years. Even if any of the science of it is right, it doesn’t mean Betelgeuse is about to explode any day now. And since this is a rumor three times removed, I don’t put any stock in it. I’ll wait until I hear from named scientists with published or publishable data before I start to wonder if the star is about to blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if and when it does explode, it can’t hurt us. Someday it will — maybe not for a hundred thousand years, but someday —  and every astronomer on the planet hopes it happens in their lifetime! It will be a scientific bonanza unlike any ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

This would &lt;a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/01/my-take-ending-dont-ask-dont-tell-would-undermine-religious-liberty/"&gt;cause terrible suffering for military chaplains&lt;/a&gt;, compromising their liberty to be bigots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that all 1.4 million members of the U.S. military will be subject to sensitivity training intended to indoctrinate them into the myths of the homosexual movement: that people are born "gay" and cannot change and that homosexual conduct does no harm to the individual or to society.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Anyone who points to the mountain of evidence to the contrary - or merely expresses the personal conviction that sex should be reserved for marriage between one man and one woman - runs the risk of receiving a negative performance evaluation for failing to support the military's "equal opportunity policy" regarding "sexual orientation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I believe you can change how people behave sexually, and this policy change won&amp;#39;t change that at all. Of course, forcing people to act sexually in ways which bring them no joy is also a great way to cause deep misery. I just look at all the tightly puckered smarmy jiveweasels inhabiting right wing Christian think-tanks, for instance, and see a horde of frustrated, tightly-wound self-flagellators — it&amp;#39;s no wonder they so look forward to an afterlife in their death-cult, because this one is giving them nothing but priggishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For no other offense than believing what all the great monotheistic religions have believed for all of history, some service members will be denied promotion, will be forced out of the service altogether, or will simply choose not to reenlist. Other citizens will choose not to join the military in the first place. The numbers lost will dwarf the numbers gained by opening the ranks to practicing homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those "great" monotheistic religions also teach that women are inferior, that slavery is a respectable institution, that to kill and be killed for your god is a virtue, that homosexuals are to be stoned to death. Don't try to tell me that because a centuries-old book of tribalism and superstition says something is so, it deserves respect. It does not. It has earned contempt and dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These same kinds of &lt;a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/military_history.html"&gt;bigoted remarks were made when the executive order to integrate blacks and whites in the military was made&lt;/a&gt;, which wasn&amp;#39;t actually that long ago…before 1948, military units were segregated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many white Americans (especially Southerners) responded with visceral revulsion to the idea of close physical contact with blacks. Many also perceived racial integration as a profound affront to their sense of social order. Blacks, for their part, often harbored deep mistrust of whites and great sensitivity to any language or actions that might be construed as racial discrimination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So his holy book and ignorant superstitions are not cause to continue a policy of discrimination, we have a history of similar arguments being made and being proven wrong…what about his claim that this change in policy will drive out good god-fearin&amp;#39; gay-hatin&amp;#39; soldiers and chaplains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screw them. Let 'em go. We're better off without those fundagelical frauds in the military anyway. And just think how much this will hurt their efforts to infiltrate and take over our military forces!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in case you're feeling some pity for good ol' boys with a hatred for gays who'll be forced to change their professions and leave a military career because they feel so deeply that the faggots need to be caged, don't. Martyrdom is a very Christian ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they only like the pseudo-martyrdom of being compelled to tolerate others.  Voluntarily quitting a career isn't quite a sacrifice on the scale that Matthew Shepard made, or comparable to the kind of persecution they've been perpetrating on gay citizens for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, here's a &lt;a href="http://missioncompromised.org/"&gt;site that promotes discrimination against gays&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at this lovely argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We Must Protect Our Military
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Our military exists to fight and win wars, not engage in radical social engineering. Forcing soldiers to cohabit with people who view them as sexual objects would inevitably lead to increased sexual tension, sexual harassment, and even sexual assault.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, that sounds familiar — isn&amp;#39;t that the same claim Muslims use for swaddling women up to protect them from the uncontrollable lusts of men? I guess the US is in big trouble — our soldiers are so weak and undisciplined that they&amp;#39;ll simply lapse into gay orgies if ordered to exercise tolerance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/06/tony_perkins_weeps_for_benight.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/APIAJHn7lwA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275427510613"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=2038">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28cc44b8d4b8a063</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Innovation isn’t just about science funding</title><published>2010-06-01T21:25:03Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T21:25:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/innovation-isnt-just-about-science-funding/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">Improving Canadian innovation is a major justification for the government’s recent investment in the Canada Excellence Research Chairs.

I went to last year’s Festival, and I have great respect for Brian Greene and Tracy Day for bringing together such a massive undertaking.  It would be better if they didn’t take money from the Templeton Foundation, but money has to come from somewhere, and I’m not the one paying the bills.  I don’t even mind having a panel that talks about religion — it’s a big part of many people’s lives, and there are plenty of issues to be discussed at the intersection of science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it would be a lot more intellectually respectable to present a balanced discussion of those issues, rather than the one that is actually lined up.  The panelists include two scientists who are Templeton Prize winners — Francisco Ayala and Paul Davies — as well as two scholars of religion — Elaine Pagels and Thupten Jinpa.  Nothing in principle wrong with any of those people, but there is a somewhat obvious omission of a certain viewpoint:  those of us who think that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible/"&gt;science and religion are not compatible&lt;/a&gt;.  And there are a lot of us!  Also, we’re right.  A panel like this does a true disservice to people who are curious about these questions and could benefit from a rigorous airing of the issues, rather than a whitewash where everyone mumbles pleasantly about how we should all just get along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not as much of an anti-Templeton fundamentalist as some people are; I won’t take money from them, but I will cooperate with institutions and organizations that do take money from them, even as I grumble about it.  (Money laundering as the route to moral purity.)  But this event is a perfect example of the ultimately pernicious influence that Templeton has.  I disagree with Jerry and others who consider Templeton money a “&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/02/27/the-templeton-bribe/"&gt;bribe&lt;/a&gt;” to people who are willing to go along with their party line; I have no doubt that Ayala, Davies, Pagels and Jinpa will express only views that they sincerely hold and would still hold in the absence of any monetary reward.  What Templeton does is that it hands people with those views a giant megaphone.  Francisco Ayala is a respected scientist who happens to believe that science and religion complement each other rather than coming into conflict; that’s fine, although somewhat unremarkable.  But then he wins the Templeton Prize, and that exact same opinion &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627546.800-templeton-prizewinner-we-need-science-plus-morality.html"&gt;gets plastered all over the media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Panels like this one at the WSF are the same story.  Maybe exactly the same event would have been organized even if Templeton had nothing to do with the Festival; but I doubt it.&lt;/strike&gt;  (Update: upon reflection, I don’t know what the process was by which the event was organized, and I shouldn’t cast dark aspersions in the absence of evidence. My real point is that I don’t think that the panel should have happened the way it did, and I don’t want to detract from that.)  Plenty of science festivals and museums seem to get along perfectly well without discussing religion at all.  And if you did want to discuss it, there’s no way that an honest investigation into how scientists feel about religion would end up leaving out some fully committed atheists who would be pretty uncompromising towards belief.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hundred years after Galileo turned his telescope on the heavens, it’s incredibly frustrating that we still have debates over whether the world can be described in purely naturalistic terms, rather than accepting that insight as an amazing accomplishment and moving on to the hard work of articulating its consequences.  It’s a shame that the World Science Festival is helping to keep us back, rather than moving us forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mice had their paws injected with rather unpleasant stuff called Complete Freund’s Adjuvant. This makes them inflamed and sore, so they are unusually sensitive to pain.  When the mice were pierced with human-sized needles, and the needles rotated, they responded a bit less to painful stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper reports of this paper were even worse than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst of the lot was Richard Alleyne, in the &lt;em&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;: “&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7785824/Acupuncture-does-work-as-it-stimulates-a-natural-pain-killer-scientists-find.html"&gt;Acupuncture does work as it stimulates a natural pain killer, scientists find&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona McCrae in the Daily Mail was marginally better, with “&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1282678/Acupuncture-DOES-ease-pain.html"&gt;Let’s get straight to the point, acupuncture DOES ease pain&lt;/a&gt;“. At least she manages to include a brief critical comment from Edzard Ernst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the usually-excellent Ian Sample in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; was unusually gullible with “&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/may/30/acupuncture-pain-natural-painkiller"&gt;Acupuncture  may ease pain by triggering release of natural painkiller&lt;/a&gt;“. The subheading did say the study was done in mice not man, but there was no critical comment and, as in the other reports, no attempt to summarise what’s known already about acupuncture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still, it wasn’t just the newspapers.  There were similar poor reports in &lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/05/how-acupuncture-pierces-chronic-.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=mechanism-points-to-acupuncture-pai-10-05-30"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and even the &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2010/05/acupuncture_works_in_mice.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; news blog&lt;/a&gt; left a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this sort of misreporting occurs, it often seems to come from the press release (another case documented &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=209"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Many journalists never get any further than the press release, Here is &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;‘s press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOI: 10.1038/nn.2562 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture can relieve many kinds of pain, but it remains unclear how it might work, beyond the possibility of a strong placebo effect. A study published online in&lt;em&gt; Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; now shows that acupuncture locally activates pain-suppressing receptors which could be the key to the treatment’s ability to relieve pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maiken Nedergaard and colleagues inserted fine needles into the mouse equivalent of a traditional acupuncture point near the knee, and rotated these needles intermittently as is practiced by acupuncturists. This alleviated the pain reactions of mice with an inflamed paw, and it also strongly increased the local tissue concentration of the neurotransmitter adenosine.  Pain relief required the presence of a particular adenosine receptor. It is known that this receptor resides on pain-transmitting nerve fibers and can reduce the activity of these fibers. The authors  found that no pain relief or adenosine elevation was observed when the needles were simply inserted into the acupuncture point without rotation. They also noted that a drug that prolongs the lifetime  of adenosine in live tissue helped to prolong the pain-attenuating effect of mouse acupuncture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that while this work suggests a mechanism for local pain relief by acupuncture, it does not in any way endorse the ancient mystical idea that the needles  work by correcting some aberrant “qi”   energy flow along “meridians”. Instead, the authors propose a model whereby the minor tissue injury caused by rotated needles triggers adenosine release, which,  if close enough to pain-transmitting nerves, can lead to the suppression of local pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Maiken Nedergaard (University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;a href="mailto:nedergaard@urmc.rochester.edu"&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nedergaard@urmc.rochester.edu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="en-us"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title, and the first sentence, are tendentious, to put it mildly.  The false assertion that &amp;quot;Acupuncture can relieve many kinds of pain&amp;quot; misrepresents entirely the current state of the evidence.  A lot has been written about acupuncture, not least &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=acupuncture"&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;, but the current position can be summed up roughly as follows.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been found time and time again that no difference can be detected between real and sham acupuncture in blind comparisons, and
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a non-blind comparison between acupuncture and no-acupuncture usually shows some advantage for the acupuncture, but the effect is small, transient and very variable.  A &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=945"&gt;recent review from the Nordic Cochrane&lt;/a&gt; group concluded the effect was barely big enough to be clinically significant.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds are that acupuncture is no more than a theatrical placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release should have made all this clear, but failed to do so. But then the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/pdf/nn.2562.pdf"&gt;paper itself&lt;/a&gt; also failed to make the context clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract of the paper starts &amp;quot;Acupuncture is an invasive procedure commonly used to relieve pain.&amp;quot;  The second paragraph starts &amp;quot;Although the analgesic effect of acupuncture is well documented, little is understood about its biological basis&amp;quot;.  It is simply not true that &amp;quot;analgesic effect of acupuncture is well documented&amp;quot;.  It is not.  Try reading &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell"&gt;Barker Bausell’s excellent book, “Snake Oil Science”&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know about the strength of the evidence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole paper is written with the underlying premise that acupuncture works, and all that needs to be done is to explain why.  How the paper got past the referees in its present form beggars belief.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journals like &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, like it or not, have a certain prestige. Of course, the prestige is exaggerated, and like all journals, it has some good papers and some poor ones. With that prestige comes responsibility to ensure that press releases are accurate. But one often has the impression that press releases are written with the aim of getting wide press coverage, and prestige for  the journal, rather that as critical evaluations of the science.  This is one such case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Rees said today, in his first Reith lecture, that &amp;quot;science is organised scepticism&amp;quot;.  It should be, and in the long run, it is.  This paper is an exception and sadly it isn’t alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other commentaries on this paper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have already been some excellent commentaries on blogs.  As so often, the best bloggers are sharper than the scientific journals.  If it were not for the fact that my comments on Twitter got some criticism from &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, I wouldn’t have bothered to add to the following excellent analyses&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Yong, in the Discover site&lt;/strong&gt; was quick off the mark with &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/30/a-biological-basis-for-acupuncture-or-more-evidence-for-a-placebo-effect/"&gt;A biological basis for acupuncture, or more evidence for a placebo effect?&lt;/a&gt;.  This provides more detail than I’ve given here.  It also has an intriguing postscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PS: The paper notes that the authors have no competing financial interests that might have affected their work. However, it is worth noting that one of the co-authors, Jurgen Schnermann, is married to one Josephine Briggs. Briggs is the director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine [NCCAM], an institute that has had its fair share of controversy in the past.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCCAM is, of course the branch of the US National Institutes of Health that has spent over a billion dollars of US taxpayers’ money without coming up with a single good treatment.  This is rather fascinating, because the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;report in the Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; ends with a laudatory comment from, ahem. Dr Josephine Briggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Josephine Briggs, director of the National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health in the US, said: “It is clear that acupuncture may activate a number of different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This carefully performed study identifies adenosine as a new player in the process. It is an interesting contribution to our growing understanding of the complex intervention which is acupuncture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Cole&lt;/strong&gt; at the Stuff and Nonsense blog has another take on the same work, under the ironic title &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/acupuncture-works-say-scientists/"&gt;Acupuncture Works, Say Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/strong&gt;, Orac gives a superb and thorough account.  Read it: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/when_what_an_acupuncture_study_shows_is.php"&gt;When what an acupuncture study shows is much more interesting than what acupuncture believers think it shows&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a favorite health-focused nonprofit? If you do, it’s time to let &lt;a href="http://greatnonprofits.org/"&gt;GreatNonprofits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www2.guidestar.org/"&gt;GuideStar&lt;/a&gt; know about it. Throughout the month of June, these two organizations are working together – in partnership with the National Association for &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/health/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=health&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Fitness,  Mental Health America, Cancer Schmancer, Diabetes Hands Foundation, FACE  AIDS, and HopeLab – to compile user generated reviews of nonprofits in order to identify the best groups that work to improve the health and well-being of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://greatnonprofits.org/health"&gt;And they want to know what you think!&lt;/a&gt; You can be a  donor, volunteer,  board member, client, or a member of the public. Tell them: How do these organizations make an  impact? Which ones are great? Which ones need improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a nonprofit garners at least 10 positive reviews by June 30, 2010, it’ll be included on the GreatNonprofits Top-Rated Health Nonprofits List. And participating nonprofit organizations may be eligible  for a $5,000 GuideStar Health &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/giveaway/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=giveaway&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;Giveaway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let GreatNonprofits know what groups are making a positive difference in your community – &lt;a href="http://greatnonprofits.org/health"&gt;visit GreatNonprofits Health Campaign 2010&lt;/a&gt; to write a review in your own words of your favorite health-related nonprofit. And don’t miss the June 30 deadline!&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last week and a half we’ve hosted a great talk by Jen McCreight on May 23 and held a pretty bad ass counter protest at the Autism One anti-vaccination rally in Chicago’s Grant Park on May 26. If you read any other skeptical blogs besides Skepchick, or read the Chicago Tribune, you probably heard about them. But not here… you know, where the president and founder of the organization blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fnal-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="fnal-1" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fnal-1-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’m going to play the only card I’ve got on this one – I just had a baby. May 20! She was delivered by c-section and spent 5 days in the NICU. She showed up a week earlier than scheduled. We’re still catching up on everything we didn’t get done because we thought we’d have extra time… and I’m still healing from surgery. I HAVE AN EXCUSE! GET OFF MY BACK! (Also, I’m out of oxycontin… if you have a spare prescription pad, email me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve been slacking and popping pain killers for the last week and a half, the WTF board of directors asked me to start pulling my weight and promote our bad ass &lt;strong&gt;behind-the-scenes FermiLab tour fundraiser on June 12&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll meet at &lt;strong&gt;10:00am&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.fnal.gov/culture/NewArts/fermi_directions.shtml"&gt;front reception desk at Wilson Hall&lt;/a&gt;, get an intro to Fermilab, go on a guided walk-through tour of the Linear Accelerator building and the 15th floor of &lt;a href="http://history.fnal.gov/highrise.html"&gt;Wilson Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and a Q&amp;amp;A with a real live Fermilab woman scientist! Yes! A woman and a scientist in ONE BODY! That’s certainly worth your $30!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after you’re done at Fermi, you’re going to head over to Gino’s East in St Charles for pizza! For free*!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;*with purchase of $30 tour ticket&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is &lt;a href="http://www.shop.womenthinkingfree.org/FermiLab-tour_c5.htm"&gt;buy a ticket at our online store&lt;/a&gt; and show up at Wilson Hall. Tickets are limited to 40 people (kids 10 and older are welcome) and must be purchased in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shop.womenthinkingfree.org/FermiLab-tour_c5.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (NOTE: You WILL NOT receive a paper ticket)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deets:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fermilab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:00am, Saturday June 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$30 – includes tour and lunch at Gino’s East&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you survive a cardiac event could depend on where you are. Neighborhoods whose residents are poorer, less educated, and have more black residents yield higher death rates as a result of cardiac incidents. When researchers studied areas in Georgia, people who had a heart attack in Fulton County (Atlanta area) were up to three times more likely to die – and less likely to have bystanders perform CPR – than those who suffered heart attacks in other Georgia counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because heart disease is the number one killer of American women, it’s troubling to know that some deaths could be avoided if the victim walks down a different street. It’s impractical to avoid certain areas because there’s a chance you’ll have a heart attack while you’re there; so we hope legislators use this research to enact more rigorous CPR training in schools and public &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/health/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=health&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; centers, as well as develop more prompt EMS responses in high-risk areas. Of course, individuals should take responsibility for their health, but the government should do its part to reduce cardiac incident deaths in economically disadvantaged areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s good bacteria, and there’s bad bacteria, and until now, both were fair game for antibacterial products. While that’s made antibacterial bandages a subject of debate, researchers at the University of Bath in England have created a bandage that kills only the bacteria that will cause an infection, and lets the good bacteria continue healing the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists predict that the more discerning bandages won’t be on the market until 2017, so we have six-and-a-half more years to battle the pros and cons of antibacterial bandages. (We’re not sure about their healing powers, but they definitely make our skin stickier.) Hopefully the scientists can come up with a formula that not only leaves good germs alone, but also minimizes the goo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I gotta admit that my friend Orac moved me to render this &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special 10th Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W^5/2™&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (after a brief hiatus) by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/when_what_an_acupuncture_study_shows_is.php"&gt;mentioning it today&lt;/a&gt; in the context of &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.2562.html"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; that used, er, the &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt; of our venerable game to great advantage! Some of it is brilliant, unprecedented even:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Perhaps most tellingly, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service approved acupuncture as a deductible medical expense in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hat is off to whoever came up with that one! Hey, y’gotyer basic logical fallacies, right? Y’gotyer appeal to tradition, yer appeal to popularity (or, as Orac put it, yer &lt;em&gt;argumentum ad populum&lt;/em&gt;—sheece, is he a snob er what?), yer appeal to authority, which, I shpoze, an appeal to the IRS is a species of, as it were (hmmm: is that appeal heard in Tax Court?)…but there’s something just a little more special about this than just that. Therefore I propose, in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tremendous (and Trendy!) Tradition of Trademarked Titles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;™&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; long associated with the Wonderful &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W^5/2™&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a bran’, spankin’ new fallacy of its own, presented, of course, in a tasteful Madison Avenue format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you unsure about your cure? Has that acupuncture juncture got you in a funk, sir? Don’t be waverin’ when you could be savorin’! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Facts to the Max, consult the Sheriff of the Tariff!©&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;(Or, in the hifalutin’ language favored by the sniffing Orac, &lt;em&gt;argumentum ad yer-workin’-for-nobody-but-meum).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Week’s Entry &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;But enuffa that. Let’s lookit the translations submitted for &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165"&gt;‘last week’s’&lt;/a&gt; entry, which, as y’ll recall, was itself submitted by loyal &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W^5/2™&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gamer &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wertys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;! Not that you need reminding, because it’s obviously fresh in your minds, but that entry is once again topical thanks to Harriet Hall’s most &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5339"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;, seein’ as how it was all about “palpatory literacy”—in the chiropractic sense, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;First off, I gotta gently chide a fewayuz who just seemed to wanna scold. I mean, lighten up a little, OK, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11837"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Benway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11844"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perky Skeptic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11852"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MedsVsTherapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11865"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurjen S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Then there’s an intriguing comment by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-22161"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AppealToAuthority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that just maybe the authors of the entry were attempting, in a chiropractic journal, to appeal to rationality, or, even better, to write a satire. Either one seems doubtful, but I gotta admit I hadn’t thoughta that, even if I totally agreed with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11848"&gt;Stu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (m’man!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;As always, of course, the real kudos have gotta go to translators who really put their hearts’n’souls into it, ifya know wuddeye mean: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11834"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (even if he did &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11878"&gt;nominate himself&lt;/a&gt;, f’cryin’ outloud), &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11955"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mojo,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11849"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sastra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11854"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Wode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11859"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mmarsh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=165#comment-11858"&gt;Stu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (m’man!), using (what else?) the &lt;em&gt;Power of Simple Substitution&lt;/em&gt; first unveiled &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=68#comment-2054"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Award-Winning, Wondrous and Wonderful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W^5/2™!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Week’s Entry: Alan Sokal, Cultural Studies, and…Homeopathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Most readers of this blog are probably aware of the “Sokal Hoax” of the mid-90s: Alan Sokal, a physicist at NYU, wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html"&gt;satirical article&lt;/a&gt; titled “Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermaneutics of Quantum Gravity.” As you may gather from that title or already know, Sokal wrote the article in the style recently favored by a strain of “post-modern” academics. He did it, in extreme summary, to protest the burgeoning nonsense portrayed, by that set, as scientific knowledge. Here is a juicy sample from Sokal’s piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;But whose mathematics? The question is a fundamental one, for, as Aronowitz has observed, “neither logic nor mathematics escapes the ‘contamination’ of the social.” And as feminist thinkers have repeatedly pointed out, in the present culture this contamination is overwhelmingly capitalist, patriarchal and militaristic: “mathematics is portrayed as a woman whose nature desires to be the conquered Other.” Thus, a liberatory science cannot be complete without a profound revision of the canon of mathematics. As yet no such emancipatory mathematics exists, and we can only speculate upon its eventual content. We can see hints of it in the multidimensional and nonlinear logic of fuzzy systems theory; but this approach is still heavily marked by its origins in the crisis of late-capitalist production relations. Catastrophe theory, with its dialectical emphases on smoothness/discontinuity and metamorphosis/unfolding, will indubitably play a major role in the future mathematics; but much theoretical work remains to be done before this approach can become a concrete tool of progressive political praxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The hoax occurred when Sokal’s article was accepted and published, with an entirely straight face, by the trendy “cultural studies” journal &lt;a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_text/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A few months later Sokal &lt;a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html"&gt;revealed the hoax&lt;/a&gt; in another journal, &lt;em&gt;Lingua Franca&lt;/em&gt;. After that, as they say, all hell broke loose. You can read all about the affair &lt;a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/#papers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (it’s worth doing, for entertainment value as well as for a scary look at academic culture of only a few years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In my opinion, the “Sokal Hoax” is one of the best things that has happened during my lifetime. The reason that it pertains to this week’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W^5/2™, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;however, stems from Sokal’s &lt;a href="http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/afterword_v1a/afterword_v1a_singlefile.html"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;, after the fact, of the style that he had had to learn in order to write the satire, and how difficult that had been for him to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;Like the genre it is meant to satirize — myriad exemplars of which can be found in my reference list — my article is a mélange of truths, half-truths, quarter-truths, falsehoods, non sequiturs, and syntactically correct sentences that have no meaning whatsoever. (Sadly, there are only a handful of the latter: I tried hard to produce them, but I found that, save for rare bursts of inspiration, I just didn’t have the knack.) I also employed some other strategies that are well-established (albeit sometimes inadvertently) in the genre: appeals to authority in lieu of logic; speculative theories passed off as established science; strained and even absurd analogies; rhetoric that sounds good but whose meaning is ambiguous; and confusion between the technical and everyday senses of English words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It seems to have been much easier for those that Sokal satirized to write such drivel, as he demonstrated in numerous quotations throughout his satire. Here is Sokal citing one such author:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;Along parallel lines, Donna Haraway (1991, 191-192) has argued eloquently for a democratic science comprising “partial, locatable, critical knowledges sustaining the possibility of webs of connections called solidarity in politics and shared conversations in epistemology” and founded on “a doctrine and practice of objectivity that privileges contestation, deconstruction, passionate construction, webbed connections, and hope for transformation of systems of knowledge and ways of seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Here he quotes verbatim from English professor &lt;a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/people/rmarkley"&gt;Robert Markley&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;Quantum physics, hadron bootstrap theory, complex number theory, and chaos theory share the basic assumption that reality cannot be described in linear terms, that nonlinear — and unsolvable — equations are the only means possible to describe a complex, chaotic, and non-deterministic reality. These postmodern theories are — significantly — all metacritical in the sense that they foreground themselves as metaphors rather than as “accurate” descriptions of reality. In terms that are more familiar to literary theorists than to theoretical physicists, we might say that these attempts by scientists to develop new strategies of description represent notes towards a theory of theories, of how representation — mathematical, experimental, and verbal — is inherently complex and problematizing, not a solution but part of the semiotics of investigating the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Yup, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=62"&gt;language matters&lt;/a&gt;. There is an intimate relation between style and honesty. In &lt;em&gt;Lingua Franca,&lt;/em&gt; Sokal wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;padding-left:30px"&gt;In short, my concern over the spread of subjectivist thinking is both intellectual and political. Intellectually, the problem with such doctrines is that they are false (when not simply meaningless). There is a real world; its properties are not merely social constructions; facts and evidence do matter. What sane person would contend otherwise? And yet, much contemporary academic theorizing consists precisely of attempts to blur these obvious truths — the utter absurdity of it all being concealed through obscure and pretentious language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Text’s&lt;/em&gt; acceptance of my article exemplifies the intellectual arrogance of Theory — meaning postmodernist literary theory — carried to its logical extreme. No wonder they didn’t bother to consult a physicist. If all is discourse and “text,” then knowledge of the real world is superfluous; even physics becomes just another branch of Cultural Studies. If, moreover, all is rhetoric and “language games,” then internal logical consistency is superfluous too: a patina of theoretical sophistication serves equally well. Incomprehensibility becomes a virtue; allusions, metaphors and puns substitute for evidence and logic. My own article is, if anything, an extremely modest example of this well-established genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On, then, to the fun! Several weeks ago, spurred by &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178&amp;amp;cpage=2#comment-45285"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and similar comments, I was temporarily inspired to write a satirical homeopathy treatise employing the sort of verbiage quoted above (I even suggested to SD that he might do it, for it seemed that he’d already demonstrated the knack, but he didn’t reply). Well, it proved to require more than a trivial effort and I kinda forgot about it for a time, and then one day it was just STARING ME IN THE FACE! Not, alas, as a satire, but, as had been Alan Sokal’s initial experience, as a completely serious composition, fully formed! Aha, the cognoscenti among you are thinking, I musta read something by &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19922258"&gt;Lionel Milgrom&lt;/a&gt;. Good try, but nope; this is even better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Logics of the Quantal Base State in Homeopathic Potentization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Potentizing homeopathic substances beyond the Avogadro limit is a critical-state coherent process, wherein an element of active information cannot be considered identical to itself. Temporal ordering is paramount in transferring such information to and from the quantal base state, and requires m-valued logics and skew-parallel geometries to represent the identity transparency produced by the active temporal operators. In order to model the turbulent dynamics of dilution-succussion, the Hilbert space of quantum theory must be modified under m-valued logics such that a multivalued reference space becomes the informational ground, or quantal base state, decomposed and recomposed by operator-time. Such temporal operations inherently involve complex angular momentum exhange via “imaginary time”. This temporal-spin is a generalization of Dirac’s “spin coordinate” and offers insight into how homeotherapeutic potency sustains itself indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:left"&gt;In homeopathic potentization the dilution-succussion process…becomes a water-borne stack of crisis states that cascade highly organized (i.e., coherent) time-pattern shapes through the nested collection of “acetate” clock-sheets constituting the transparent information ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:left"&gt;—Pensinger W, Paine D, Jus J. &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Insititute of Homeopathy&lt;/em&gt; 90(2): 77-88 (1997)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Truth sure is stranger than fiction, i’nit? Happy Waluating!&lt;/p&gt;

But what’s the best way to get there? &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/exercise-and-diet?cat=20153&amp;amp;tip=20147"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; examined several health goals, and determined whether or not diet or exercise is the most effective method of reaching each goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:290px"&gt;&lt;img title="px244s011" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/06/78632447-280x186.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="186"&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo: Thinkstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Loss:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re trying to drop pounds, the best way to do that is through dieting. It’s much easier to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/eat/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=eat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt; 300 fewer calories every day than to run three more miles at the gym, and research shows that trimming calories from your diet is the most direct way to trim your waistline. Exercise will help keep the weight off, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Energy:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re low on energy, however, hit the gym to increase your levels of dopamine and norepinephrin, which will result in increased energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweating is also the best way to improve your mood – one &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/exercise/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=exercise&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; session can boost your mood for 12 hours. It’ll also help you deal with stress more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing Heart Disease and Diabetes:&lt;/strong&gt; When it comes to preventing future health problems, dieting will help prevent heart disease more effectively, while exercise is more beneficial when trying to reduce the risk of diabetes. To ward off heart disease, pack your diet with omega-3 fatty acids – they can reduce the risk of heart disease up to 64%. Exercising, however, will cause your muscles to absorb more glucose from the blood, which will keep your blood sugar more level. Of course, you want to make sure you’re at a healthy weight as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; The best method of cancer prevention involves both exercise and dieting. Eating a largely plant-based diet and regular exercise are the best ways to protect yourself from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Blisstree cringes at the word “dieting,” you can’t go wrong with a combination of a &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/healthy-eating/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=healthy%20eating&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;exercise, especially if you’re hoping to achieve multiple health goals. (Who doesn’t want to protect themselves from both heart disease &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;diabetes?) Working out regularly while eating lots of healthy, natural foods is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  &lt;a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/limits-of-understanding"&gt;The Limits of Understanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  &lt;a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/mind-and-machine"&gt;The Future of Thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, it wouldn’t be a proper World Science Festival without a panel on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.   &lt;a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/faith-and-science"&gt;Faith and Science&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all their historical tensions, scientists and religious scholars  from a wide variety of faiths ponder many similar questions—how did the  universe begin? How might it end? What is the origin of matter, energy,  and life? The modes of inquiry and standards for judging progress are,  to be sure, very different. But is there a common ground to be found?  ABC News’ &lt;strong&gt;Bill Blakemore&lt;/strong&gt; moderates a panel that  includes evolutionary geneticist &lt;strong&gt;Francisco Ayala&lt;/strong&gt;,  astrobiologist &lt;strong&gt;Paul Davies&lt;/strong&gt;, Biblical scholar &lt;strong&gt;Elaine  Pagels&lt;/strong&gt; and Buddhist scholar &lt;strong&gt;Thupten Jinpa&lt;/strong&gt;.  These leading thinkers who come at these issues from a range of  perspectives will address the evolving relationship between science and  faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the Science Festival is so delighted to have Templeton’s money (after all, the organization is one of their “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/arts/31science.html"&gt;founding benefactors&lt;/a&gt;“) that they’ll permit the incursion of panels stacked with Templeton people. Davies and Ayala are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Templeton Prize winners, and Davies’ &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/capabilities_2008/PM/fqpc_flga.html"&gt;research is funded by Templeton&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/capabilities_2008/PM/ssqur_srgr.html"&gt;see here, too)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait—why is the World Science Festival hosting a panel like this, anyway? Isn’t the science festival supposed to be about &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;, not about how to reconcile it with superstition? Did Templeton specify this panel as a condition for funding, or was it done as a favor to the Foundation by director Brian Greene? (Greene’s own work &lt;a href="http://www.templeton.org/capabilities_2008/PM/ssqur_srgr.html"&gt;has also been funded by Templeton&lt;/a&gt;.)  The Festival has had a Templeton-sponsored faith-and-science-accommodation panel &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/in-which-i-refuse-an-invitation-to-the-world-science-festival-on-grounds-of-accommodationism/"&gt;every year since at least 2008&lt;/a&gt; (I turned down an invitation in 2009), so this is not a one-off thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the WSF is pitching woo, how about this panel for next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  Homeopathy and Medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all their historical tensions, physicians and homeopaths ponder many similar  questions—how do we cure people of diseases? Does surgery really work?  What is the efficacy of treating infectious disease with distilled water? The modes of inquiry and standards  for judging progress are,  to be sure, very different. But is there a  common ground to be found?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to God Templeton would keep its filthy mitts off the World Science Festival—indeed, off science, period—but that’s not going to happen so long as the Foundation has deep pockets and there are scientists with outstretched hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I missed one symposium sponsored by Templeton: &lt;a href="http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/back-to-the-big-bang"&gt;Back to the Big Bang: Inside the Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet access here is sketchy and I have eight pages of typed transcript already. So, what I’ll post here is the summary from the end of the talk by Judy Wilyman, PhD Candidate Murdoch University. Big, big thanks to Dan, who got me in here despite there being a big asterisk next to his name on the check-in list and it made me go ‘eep’! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She wants answers to her questions – and says that despite talking to the WA Gov yesterday (who the introductory spiel points out haven’t turned up tonight), she’s not getting any.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of lecture:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- vaccination is not the main reason for decline in infectious diseases – Wallace, over 100 years ago reported that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- it is  not prove that ingredients in vaccines are not causing the chronic illness in our kids – and that the vaccinations outweigh the harm – and their evidence by the Dept Health is that they say that vaccinations have controlled disease and therefore we’re more concerned about side effects, but by 1950s in developed countries they were at low risk just naturally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Claims that the vaccines are brought in for herd immunity and no disease has been eradicated by herd immunity so don’t do it for herd immunity. If others decided that there’s no harm, then that’s not a good enough excuse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Therefore says that there is precautionary principle and it’s not good enough.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wants a new health ethics assumption for the AVN policy that she thinks should be spread and adopted:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The burden of proof of harmless is on the government – not the general public.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; We can no longer state is its for the community good when so many vaccinations are being used&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; This procedure is for healthy individuals – coercive policies are unacceptable if no hard evidence of the harm that requires multiple vaccinations  – and McIntyre said so and there is no need for herd immunity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get better community protection if you don’t vaccinate for a disease – you won’t find evidence that lack of vaccination is harmful if you are not looking and she says the government isn’t looking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She has said at least three times that vaccinations contain mercury.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Meryl is talking, so will have to work on transcribing her – hers is called “Influenza vaccination – nothing to sneeze about.”&lt;/p&gt;

LA has seen its first outbreak of measles in four years there, and it's something to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the April issue of Pediatrics examined a 2008 measles outbreak in San Diego. The index case was a 7-year-old unvaccinated child who was exposed to the virus while abroad. This case resulted in 839 exposed persons, 11 actual cases (all in unvaccinated children) and the hospitalization of an infant too young to be vaccinated. In total, the outbreak cost the public more than $175,000, which would have covered the costs of measles vaccinations for almost 180,000 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You skip out on giving your kids a cheap, easy, routine shot, and this is what you can do: harm hundreds. Measles is also the kind of disease people can die of, too, so there's an even greater risk than making a lot of people miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this next bit was the most compelling part of the story. How can smart people be so stupid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, many parents continue not to vaccinate their children. I see such children frequently. Last fall, when I entered an examination room, a 5-year-old patient loudly yelled "Get out!" Her mother apologized, then explained. "Sorry, she's never gotten S-H-O-T-S before."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Confused, I looked down at the chart to confirm that the patient was in for H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Seeing that she was, I seized the opportunity to offer her catch-up vaccines as well, but her mother declined. She explained matter-of-factly that it was because the flu was "going around" whereas the other vaccine-preventable diseases, she said, were no longer a threat.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She went on to tell me that she was a lawyer who had grown up in a country where measles is still endemic. Since moving to the U.S., she had never known anyone to suffer from measles, but she did know several children who had autism. So, while she understood that vaccinations had not been definitively shown to cause autism, she felt that, here in America, the risk of autism was a bigger threat than that of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No longer a threat? That&amp;#39;s awfully short-sighted. This clever lawyer moved to this country from a place where the disease was endemic…does she think there is a super-duper barrier around America now so no more people and diseases can move here from her native country?

The study was conducted in Germany and the authors hypothesized that particulate matter air pollution may promote the development of type 2 diabetes with the proposed mechanism having to do with the development of subclinical inflammation in response to the pollution and that in turn impairing glucose metabolism.The researchers compared women leaving in the &amp;quot;highly industrialized&amp;quot; Ruhr district those living in two rural reference counties. They controlled for socio-economic status, smoking, second hand smoke exposure, occupational pollutant exposure, home heating with fossil fuels, and body mass index. The main outcome measure of the study was a physician&amp;#39;s diagnosis of diabetes during the course of the study.The results?Living closer to traffic was associated with a 15% increased relative risk of developing type 2 diabetes for every increase in interquartile range in particulate matter or nitrogen dioxide.So, should you move to the country?Not based off this study.Two huge flaws. The first? The end point was physician diagnosed diabetes. Sounds like a fair end point but having worked in rural and urban centres I can tell you the access to physicians in rural settings is not comparable to urban ones. Consequently without controlling for physician visits (or even having a physician) this study may simply be a reflection of the fact that the rural folks don&amp;#39;t have physicians to actually diagnose them with diabetes.The second? And this one should have been a deal breaker for the peer reviewers, the study didn&amp;#39;t control for diet. Given the incredible impact of diet on the development of type 2 diabetes, not controlling for diet in a study looking at the development of type 2 diabetes is rather mind boggling. Diets with consumptions of the highest quartile of refined carbohydrates confer a 400% relative risk increase in the development of type 2 diabetes when compared diets inclusive of the highest quartile of whole grain consumption. Given the differences in availabilities of fast food and farm fresh foods in urban versus rural settings, and given the small relative risk increase found in this study, there&amp;#39;s no doubt diet differences could easily account for all of it. So, while there may indeed be ills associated with air pollution, this study does nothing to suggest that diabetes is one of them.(Sorry for the late post.

I recently came across this post by Michelle Dawson that states the thesis that one of the abnormalities in Autism spectrum disorders is due to abnormal circadian clock functioning. More specifically, the clock is internally driven and has a greeter ‘free running’ period and does not entrain readily to environmental and social clues.

Specifically, the Friday afternoon talk on observing relativity with atomic clocks by Chin-Wen Chou of the Time and Frequency Division at NIST in Boulder.

The real technical advance is in a recent paper in Physical Review Letters (available for free via the Time and Frequency Publications Database, because government research isn't subject to copyright): they have made improvements to their atomic clock based on the spacing of two energy levels in a single aluminum ion (described in a Science paper, also available free at the Time and Frequency Publications Database), so it is now accurate to something like one part in 1017. They now have two "clocks" (you can argue about whether they really count as official clocks in the current configuration) based on the same ion that they can compare to unprecedented precision.

This allows a couple of really cool tricks that haven't been published anywhere (yet), but which were the subject of the DAMOP talk. These clocks are now good enough to observe relativistic effects on a human scale: they see time dilation from motion of the ion at speeds of 10m/s or less, and the gravitational redshift caused by raising one of the two clocks a foot above the other.

To generalise, you try to cope with as many different conditions as possible, so that if you get out-competed in one area you can try to cope with the conditions elsewhere. To specialise, you get damn good at using the conditions in your little niche, in the hope that you&amp;#39;ll be better than anyone else who comes along, and be able to out-compete them.There are many resources that need fighting over, and in the sea one of the major ones for photosynthetic  organisms is sunlight. Other nutrients such as nitrogen, phospherous and trace metals such as iron and copper can exist in different forms at different levels in the ocean (as shown below), but once you start getting below a certain depth, sunlight quickly becomes a finite and rapidly diminishing resource:Diagram showing availability of nutrients at different depths.Taken from the reference below.Different organisms can cope with the lack of sunlight in different ways. Some (especially the larger algae species) have generalised, they contain a whole range of different light capturing pigments which can absorb a range of light wavelengths, including those in the darker depths. But little photosynthesising bacteria like Procholorococcus (which I mentioned in this post) which have the smallest genomes of all photosynthesising organisms, don&amp;#39;t have that option. Instead they have to specialise, so that different strains in a species are adapted to different levels of light.Work done by Rocap (paper reference below) looked at two different strains of Prochlorococcus: MED4 and MIT9313 (which I will just call MED and MIT). The MED strain was found only in the surface waters, while MIT was found much lower down; a phenomenon known as &amp;#39;vertical niche partitioning&amp;#39;. Despite their genomes differing by only 3%, and despite being technically the same species (although &amp;#39;species&amp;#39; is an uncertain word in the world of bacteria) they have optimised themselves to completely different levels of not just light but also nutrients, trace metals and virus specificities. MED (the one near the surface) has a slightly smaller genome than MIT, yet contains twice as many genes dedicated to high-light-inducible proteins, many of which seem to have arisen by gene duplication. It also has genes specialised for the nitrogen sources found near the surface of the water, and organic phosphates (which again are found predominantly on the surface).MIT on the other hand has fewer genes for ultraviolet damage repair, but more light harvesting genes, for example it possesses two copies of the hight-harvesting chlorophyll binding antenna protein. This helps it to gather as much light as possible, despite being further below the surface. it&amp;#39;s also adapted for its specific nitrogen source and increased ability to use orthophosphate, rather than organic phosphates. Both genomes have lost the ability for photoacclimatisation, that is  the ability to change to suit different light conditions. By taking up vertical niche positions, they have forfeited the ability to change their response, meaning that a strict horizontal partition between them must be maintained at all times. Any Prochlorocuccus found at lower levels will be of the MIT variety, while those at higher levels will be MED. It&amp;#39;s even thought that there might be further strict niche partitioning; with different ecotypes of MED adapted to use different iron sources, or different temperatures. For the photosynthetic organisms that inhabit it, seawater is more than just a blue shifting salty mass. It&amp;#39;s a whole range of niches and environments, partitioned in three dimensions depending on the surrounding conditions and nutrients.---Rocap G, Larimer FW, Lamerdin J, Malfatti S, Chain P, Ahlgren NA, Arellano A, Coleman M, Hauser L, Hess WR, Johnson ZI, Land M, Lindell D, Post AF, Regala W, Shah M, Shaw SL, Steglich C, Sullivan MB, Ting CS, Tolonen A, Webb EA, Zinser ER, &amp;amp; Chisholm SW (2003).

It stunk, it got virtually no reviews from the scientific community, although it was avidly sucked up by the fans of Intelligent Design creationism. One curious thing about the book is that it has sunk out of sight already, which is a bit peculiar and a bit disappointing for an explanation that was promised to revitalize ID.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Michael Behe's book, &lt;i&gt;Darwin's Black Box&lt;/i&gt;? I&amp;#39;ll give Behe credit, that one was well-marketed and got the brief attention of many scientists, who read it bogglingly, recognizing quickly that it was poor fare written by someone with no idea of what was going on in evolutionary biology and genetics. But at least it was quick and punchy, and had some great PR slogans that still get thrown around — &amp;#39;irreducible complexity&amp;#39;, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meyer&amp;#39;s book had none of that. It&amp;#39;s a bloated paperweight, full of self-indulgent preening by Meyer, and without a single novel idea in it — it&amp;#39;s simply the most unmemorable, uninteresting pile of schlock the DI has turned out yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think the DI knew it. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/12/you_know_its_a_stinker_when_th.php"&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, the marketing was awful — they worked hard to keep it out of the hands of scientists who might review it ahead of time, which was an awful mistake. Even if we were pretty much guaranteed to trash it, it would be &lt;i&gt;publicity&lt;/i&gt; — look again at &lt;i&gt;Darwin's Black Box&lt;/i&gt;. If there was even a hint of controversy in the text, the best move would have been to fan it. But no…it is the most boringly tedious mess, and the only stories they got were scientists rolling their eyes in boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, reviews have trickled in…all negative. So what does the Discovery Institute do? Would you believe they have published a whole book titled &lt;a href="http://www.discoveryinstitutepress.com/signature-of-controversy/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Signature Of Controversy: Responses to Critics of Signature in the Cell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? It's only 105 pages long, so it's a more digestible read than Meyer's book, and it's also a free download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's impressive. It's a bad idea to spend too much time responding to criticisms, but the staff at the DI have been so peevish that they've written an entire book in an angry tone (hah! Tone!) in ineffectual reply. Here's an example of their cranky wit, from an introduction in which they classify their critics as either "distinguished scientists who haven't read the book" or "pygmies who populate the furious, often obscene Darwinist blogs".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Jerry Coyne is a University of Chicago biologist who lately seems to spend most of his time blogging. Yet he clearly belongs among the ranks of the more distinguished writers who bashed Meyer's book without reading it or reading about it. On the other hand, such an individual as blogger Jeffrey Shallit, mathematician at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada--not to be confused with the University of Wallamaloo of Monty Python fame--may object to being classed as a pygmy. Oh well. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's fairly typical of how they handle their critics: if they're a big name in the field, claim that they've never read the book; if they're less well known, point out that they aren't associated with the big name universities like the University of Chicago or Harvard. I even get this treatment in their brief section on me, who gets both barrels of their dual strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the people who hate Meyer's book appear not to have read it. So too we have the complaint of Darwinian-atheist agitator P. Z. Myers, a popular blogger and biologist. Myers explains that he was unable to read the book, which he slimes as a "stinker" and as "drivel," due to his not having received a promised free review copy! But rest assured. The check is in the mail: "I suppose I'll have to read that 600 page pile of slop sometime... maybe in January."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Myers teaches at the Morris, Minnesota, satellite campus of the University of Minnesota, a college well known as the Harvard of Morris, Minnesota. So you know when he evaluates a book and calls it "slop," a book on which he has not laid on eye, that's a view that carries weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In all seriousness, what is this with people having any opinion at all of a book that, allow me to repeat, they haven't read and of which, as with Jerry Coyne, they admit they haven't so much as read a review?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true that I hadn't read the book &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/12/you_know_its_a_stinker_when_th.php"&gt;when I wrote that&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s also true that they had pre-empted many of their potential critics by promising a review copy and never delivering. They still haven&amp;#39;t sent the promised copy, but I did buy one — used, for cheap — and actually did read it last January. I&amp;#39;d also seen the reviews and found the absence of any substantive content in the descriptions telling. Since reading it, which was a genuinely agonizing experience since Meyer is such a pretentious writer who goes on and on at painful length about nothing at all, I have to tell you that my summary was spot-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't posted a review because, honestly, it's a book guaranteed to inspire nothing but ennui. There isn't one solid nugget of substance or even sharply defined ideas, no matter how wrong, in the entire pile of sludge. I can, however, pull up a summary from near the end of the book, in Meyer's own words. This is the logical edifice on which his story is based. See if you can spot the flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a thorough search, no material causes have been discovered that demonstrate the power to produce large amounts of specified information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Intelligent causes have demonstrated the power to produce large amounts of specified information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Intelligent design constitutes the best, most causally adequate, explanation for information in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll notice the key phrase in there is "specified information". I looked through the whole book for a definition. There is none. Well, that's not quite true: I did find this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term specified complexity is, therefore, a synonym for specified information or information content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. One vague tautology is all he's got to back that up. Notice how revealing that is about his first point above: his entire book peddles this idea that no one has demonstrated a natural mechanism for producing &lt;i&gt;specified&lt;/i&gt; information. But of course, any one with any competence in this subject can tell you all kinds of ways a genome can produce increases in &lt;i&gt;information&lt;/i&gt;, the kind that has a few mathematical definitions and is measurable, so Meyer tosses in that magic modifier, &lt;i&gt;specified&lt;/i&gt;, to throw away a big chunk of the literature that troublingly contradicts him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps to grasp the rhetorical game he's playing, just substitute the word "magic" for "specified". It's perfectly equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a thorough search, no material causes have been discovered that demonstrate the power to produce large amounts of &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Intelligent causes have demonstrated the power to produce large amounts of &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Intelligent design constitutes the best, most causally adequate, explanation for information in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those terms, his first point is correct but uninteresting. Material causes do not produce &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; information, but so what? They do produce mundane information, and that's all we need to describe a cell. Meyer also fails to demonstrate that cells contain any &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; information in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, though, it also ruins his second point. I would cheerfully concede that intelligent processes can change the information content in a cell, and would have agreed with him on one third of his syllogism…but, unfortunately, I know of no way to produce &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; information, since Meyer hasn't bothered to define it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And his final point is both nonsense and dishonest. Note that he has left the &lt;s&gt;specified&lt;/s&gt; &lt;i&gt;magic&lt;/i&gt; qualifier off the word information this time; it's a cheap sleight of hand. Even so, though, to accept his conclusion requires accepting a false premise, that natural process have not been demonstrated to produce new information, and therefore we have to accept his claim that ID is the best explanation around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, that's all there is, that's the core of that 600 page behemoth of noise. It is most unpersuasive. Perhaps that's why they've had to produce a lengthy, carping criticism of their critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't let me give you the wrong impression: they only mentioned me in a few paragraphs, and you've just seen everything they had to say about me. The bulk of the book is dedicated to a few people who have made some telling criticisms: &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/on-reading-the-cells-signature/"&gt;Francisco Ayala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/on-reading-the-signature-a-response-to-stephen-meyer/"&gt;Darrel Falk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://recursed.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jeffrey Shallit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/"&gt;Steve Matheson&lt;/a&gt; (I must also mention &lt;a href="http://aghunt.wordpress.com/"&gt;AG Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, who also has some great &lt;a href="http://aghunt.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/well-that-was-interesting/"&gt;critiques&lt;/a&gt;…but got ignored by the DI). In particular, I recommend Shallit as someone who actually knows information theory well and does a fine job describing how Meyer butchers it; I also have to recommend &lt;a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/search/label/Signature%20in%20the%20Cell"&gt;Matheson's amazingly thorough chapter-by-chapter dissection of the book&lt;/a&gt;. If anything should be published, it's those blog entries, which neatly expose the dishonesty and ignorance that permeates every page of Meyer's hackwork. I don't know how he did it, because &lt;i&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/i&gt; was exasperatingly &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt; to me, and after reading it twice I never want anything more to do with it ever again. Maybe Matheson has discovered one virtue to religion (he's a Calvinist biologist, by the way): it teaches one how to pore over meaningless, badly written texts without lapsing into a coma.&lt;/p&gt;

Now try to think of some incident that really made you furious. Probably you can’t do it, unless you erase that smile and frown.  Alternatively, knot your fists, frown, and try to imagine an incident that made you extremely happy. You will probably start to smile or else not maintain the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or try this: Think of a high-pitched &lt;small&gt;beeeeeeep&lt;/small&gt;.  You will probably feel your vocal cords contract to match the pitch.  Now think of a low pitched BEEEEEEEP, and your vocal chords will relax to match that pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are examples of what the neuroscientist &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Descartes-Error-Antonio-Damasio/dp/0399138943" rel="external "&gt;Antonio Damasio&lt;/a&gt; calls the somatic (bodily) response – in possibly oversimplified terms, you cannot feel an emotion unless, as Damasio says, you can literally feel it, if not in your gut, then in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, it was no surprise to me to read in the LA Times that &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/health/la-he-botox-20100531,0,4090611.story" rel="external "&gt;injections of Botox in a certain muscle&lt;/a&gt; involved in frowning slowed people’s ability to comprehend “negative emotional language.” In short, if you cannot frown, then your ability to understand emotions that would cause frowning is diminished. When I read the article, I thought I got some idea of how Thomas Huxley felt when he read about Darwin’s conception of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by psychology graduate student David Havas at the University of Wisconsin–Madison asked 40 women who were awaiting Botox injections to read certain sentences on a computer and press a key when they thought they understood each sentence.  The women were retested after their Botox injections and were significantly slower to understand sentences that conveyed negative emotions but not sentences that conveyed positive emotions. There was no indication that the women responded to positive emotions faster after the injections, but the researchers administered a mood-analysis test to confirm that the women were not generally happier after the injections. The result is consistent with other experiments that relate processing of emotionally charged information with facial expression, as described in the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; article.

My argument is that when it comes to miraculous claims, yesterday’s evidence no longer can hold water for me, for in order to see it as evidence, I must already believe in the framework that allows me to see it as evidence. In other words, in order to see yesterday’s evidence as evidence for me, I must already believe the Christian framework that allows me to see yesterday’s evidence as evidence for Christianity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2439096255141021864?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

My opinion is that, well, it&amp;#39;s all rather complicated...At first glance, it seems as though it should be easy to discover the truth. SSRIs are some of the most studied drugs in the world. We have data from several hundred randomized placebo-controlled trials, totaling tens of thousands of patients. Let&amp;#39;s just look and see whether people given SSRIs are more likely to die by suicide than people given placebo.Unfortunately, that doesn&amp;#39;t really work. Actual suicides are extremely rare in antidepressant trials. This is partly because most trials only last 4 to 6 weeks, but also because anyone showing evidence of suicidal tendencies is excluded from the studies at the outset. There just aren&amp;#39;t enough suicides to be able to study.What you can do is to look at attempted suicide, and at &amp;quot;suicidality&amp;quot;, meaning suicidal thoughts and self-harming behaviours. Suicidality is more common than actual suicide, so it&amp;#39;s easier to research. Here&amp;#39;s the bad news: the evidence from a huge number of trials is that compared to placebo, antidepressants do raise the risk of suffering suicidality(1) and of suicide attempts(1) (from 1.1 per 1000 to 2.7 per 1000), when given to people with psychiatric disorders.There&amp;#39;s no good evidence that SSRIs are any worse or any better than other antidepressants, or that any one SSRI stands out as particularly bad(1,2). The risk seems to be worst in younger people: compared to placebo, SSRIs raised suicidality in people below age 25, had no effect in most adults, and lowered it in the oldest age groups(1). This is why SSRIs (and all other antidepressants) now carry a &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; in the USA, warning about the risk of suicide in young people.*This is very troubling. Hang on though. I mentioned that suicidality is an exclusion criterion from pretty much all antidepressant trials. This is for ethical as well as practical reasons: it&amp;#39;s considered unethical to give a suicidal person an experimental drug, and it&amp;#39;s really impractical to have patients dying during your trial.Indeed the recorded rate of suicidality in these trials is incredibly tiny: only 0.5% of the psychiatric patients experienced any suicidal ideation or behaviour at all(1). The other 99.5% never so much as thought about it, apparently. If that were representative of the real world it would be great; unfortunately it isn&amp;#39;t. Yet what this all means is that antidepressants could not possibly reduce suicidality in these trials, because there&amp;#39;s just nothing there to reduce. Even if, in the real world, they prevent loads of suicides, these trials wouldn&amp;#39;t show it.How do you investigate the effects of drugs &amp;quot;in the real world&amp;quot;? By observational studies - instead of recruiting people for a trial, you just look to see what happens to people who are prescribed a certain drug by their doctor. Observational studies have strengths and weaknesses. They&amp;#39;re not placebo controlled, but they can be much larger than trials, and they can study the full spectrum of patients.Observational studies have found very little evidence suggesting that antidepressants cause suicide. Most strikingly, since 1990 when SSRIs were introduced, antidepressant sales have increased enormously, and the suicide rate has fallen steadily; this is true of all Western countries.More detailed analyses of antidepressant sales vs. suicide rates across time and location have generally either found either no effect, or a small protective effect, of antidepressant sales(1,2,3, many others). In the past few years, concern over suicidality has led to a fall in antidepressant use in adolescents in many countries: but there is no evidence that this reduced the adolescent suicide rate(1,2).Another observational approach is to see whether people who have actually died by suicide were taking SSRIs at the time of death. Australian psychiatrists Dudley et al have just published a review of the evidence on this question, and they found that out of a total of 574 adolescent suicide victims from the USA, Britain, and Scandinavia, only 9 (1.5%) were taking an SSRI when they died. In other words, the vast majority of youth suicides occur in non-SSRI users. This sets a very low upper limit on the number of suicides that could be caused by SSRIs.*So what does all this mean? As I said, it&amp;#39;s very controversial, but here&amp;#39;s my take, with the standard caveat that I&amp;#39;m just some guy on the internet.The evidence from randomized controlled trials is clear: SSRIs can cause suicidality, including suicide attempts, in some people, namely some people below age 25. The chance of this happening is below 1% according to the trials, but this is still worrying given that lots of people take antidepressants. However, the use of antidepressants on a truly massive scale has not led to any rise in the suicide rate in any age group. This implies that overall, antidepressants prevent at least as many suicides as they cause.My conclusion is that the clinical trials are not much use when it comes to knowing what will happen to any individual patient. The evidence is that antidepressants could worsen suicidality, or they could reduce it. This is hardly a satisfactory conclusion for people who want neat and tidy answers, but there aren&amp;#39;t many of those in psychiatry. For patients, the implication is, boringly, that we should follow the instructions on the packet - be vigilant for suicidality, but don&amp;#39;t stop taking them except on a doctor&amp;#39;s orders.Dudley, M., Goldney, R., &amp;amp; Hadzi-Pavlovic, D.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Susan G. Komen fought breast  cancer with her heart, body, and       soul. Throughout her diagnosis,  treatments, and endless days in the       hospital, she spent her time  thinking of ways to make life better for       other women battling  breast cancer instead of worrying about her  own      situation. That  concern for others continued even as Susan  neared the      end of her  fight. Moved by Susan’s compassion for others  and  committed     to  making a difference, Nancy G. Brinker promised  her  sister that  she     would do everything in her power to end breast   cancer forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That promise is now Susan G. Komen for the Cure®, the global        leader of the breast cancer movement, having invested nearly $1.5        billion since its inception in 1982. As the world’s largest grassroots        network of breast cancer survivors and activists, we’re working      together   to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for  all,     and   energize science to find the cures. Thanks to events like  the     Susan G.   Komen Race for the Cure®, and generous contributions  from  our    partners,   sponsors, and fellow supporters, we have  become the    largest  source of   nonprofit funds dedicated to the  fight against    breast  cancer in the   world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://cassierodenberg.com/" title=""&gt;Cassie Rodenberg&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cassie Rodenberg pic2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Cassie%20Rodenberg%20pic2.jpg" width="200" height="300" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;I'm a Charleston, SC native that now resides in NYC -- a complete Northern convert that carries an appreciation for Southern plantations and shrimp 'n grits. As a kid I slogged through marshes to erect an osprey perch, played slippery 'jelly ball' (jellyfish) hockey on a shrimp boat and floated an ATV across a river, only now realizing how much science I was experiencing. The physics of ATV floating? The surprising number of jelly balls hoisted aboard a boat when hunting for shrimp? The torturous plotting of perch placement in attracting birds of prey? Science is everywhere, why hadn't I noticed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm shamelessly effervescent about science now, dying to share a cool science factoid or an interesting study, which somehow bubble out despite my best efforts to stem them! I think people care about science more than we think they do; science communicators just need to find out what intrigues them-- like ATVs or jellyfish hockey games. Enthusiasm and passion are contagious, too. If we're truly excited, others will be as well. We all need to find the inner kid that's fascinated by the world around us, the one that shouts, "oo, cool!" before trying to reach the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied chemistry during college, finding it the most beautifully simple and elegant of all the sciences. Under an NIH grant, I conducted inorganic chemistry research -- single molecule spectroscopy -- on the Amyloid-Beta peptide associated with Alzheimer's, looking at different conditions that stimulate growth of the earliest cytotoxic stages of peptide and thus spur the disease's formation. And my 11-year-old brother would be horrified if I didn't mention the coolest part: I worked with a laser in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosh, it certainly is an interesting trajectory...after my lab days I wanted to investigate the public's perception of science, how people thought about science on a daily basis. Actually, I was so intrigued, I later published psychology research on the subject. If we're making careers out of reaching people and teaching, we better understand where these people come from and how they think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I worked at a local science museum, teaching science in big public programs -- chemistry demonstrations, reptile shows (yes, I held everything from boas to Madagascar hissing roaches to tarantulas)... even walked around in a toga as the Lady of Pompeii to guide in ancient medicinal practices. Besides learning fascinating things myself (iguanas have a third light-sensing eye on the tops of their heads, my long curly hair could stand on end with enough static electricity power..), I learned quickly how to speak across age barriers, from the three-year-old to her great-grandmother to her bored aunt with a Blackberry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After, I moved to NYC and took science journalism graduate courses at NYU before becoming an in-house contributor at &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/search/fast_search?search_term=Cassie+Rodenberg+" title=""&gt;Popular Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; and a writer for the weekly science section of the &lt;a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/search/?q=cassie+rodenberg&amp;amp;submit=Search&amp;amp;aff=10002" title=""&gt;Charlotte Observer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm starting at &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/" title=""&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; as an associate web producer, working mainly with planetgreen.com, a environmental and futuristic tech initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cassie pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Cassie%20pic.jpg" width="320" height="381" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;The geek side of me loves production and organization. Though I like writing, I don't feel married to my byline -- the important thing to me is contributing to something meaningful. I hope to do more entrepreneurial work with both science- and non-science-based efforts, hopefully working with idea geniuses to launch new projects. Of course, I'd expect that whatever I delve in will have some scientific element to it, but hybridizing science with other subjects makes it more tangible to readers. We should always be reaching and trying new things... I could never imagine myself without a side project bubbling in the recesses of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You used to be involved with &lt;a href="http://www.scienceline.org/" title=""&gt;Scienceline&lt;/a&gt; until recently. Can you tell us a little bit more about the project, what was your role there, and what were your experiences while working there? Was it a useful jumping board for your career?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scienceline is a project of NYU's graduate science journalism program -- all students contributed to running the website and producing content, a mini-newsroom of sorts. It's a bit like training wheels on a bike: it's important to get newsroom experience, even working with fellow students as editors, before getting started in the real world of journalism. Though I think it is useful to an extent, especially for giving prospective employers links to clips, I encourage all students to go for internships first and foremost. I've always learned most by jumping headlong into a field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web provides science communicators a wonderful opportunity for collaboration. Once upon a time, in a small town in South Carolina, I didn't know any science writers, didn't know who to go to for advice and inspiration. The web has transformed this, and that struggle isn't true anymore, as we have genius at our fingertips at just a tweet away. We can craft ideas, bounce them off one another and form relationships. Even further, we can debunk bad science, pass along source recommendations and generate excitement on an issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out blogging but lost steam fairly quickly, realizing that Twitter was a much better outlet for my exuberance that a blog post because, honestly, I want to talk about science news constantly... but don't usually have time to blog about it. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cassierodenberg" title=""&gt;On Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, I can post the gist of my opinion and ask others for theirs in return -- much more effective and efficient than waiting around for comments on WordPress. I can feel the hum of my network around my tweets, much more vibrant than a blog. Twitter is inordinately positive in what I do -- knowing what the public thinks should be as, if not more so, important to a journalist as writing a piece, and Twitter magnifies the vitality of readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just after ScienceOnline2010, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/01/hints_on_how_science_journalis.php" title=""&gt;highlighted an online event&lt;/a&gt; in which you played a central role, that hints at how some aspects of the new journalistic ecosystem - scientist-journalist collaboration - may work. What are your thoughts, in light of this event, on the ways the science journalistic ecosystem is changing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think scientists and journalists are finally understanding how much they need one another to effectively change the way science news is disseminated. Science journalism should never have been a fragmented system, it should be a constant conversation and relationship between two different sorts of people united by a single goal. Honest and important news comes from general concern and idea generation -- the best ideas come from different vantage points. In the future, I imagine scientists and journalists brainstorming and mingling over drinks, public interest forefront. I've already mingled on Twitter -- the web only enhances the science/journalist cocktail hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It staggered me to think beyond web and print communication and on towards TV, entertainment and citizen journalism projects. It's invigorating to realize what an effort there is to mesh good science with the public realm and gives me hope that scientific accuracy may not be so far away, that scientists won't always be portrayed in movies as 'mad' and that everyone can do small science projects at home for the benefit of a larger goal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. Looking forward to meeting you again soon in NYC and I hope to see you here again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/06/scienceonline2010_-_interview_53.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/y6YtQ_bzC0I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275407320810"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=16423">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/273079122b1bfa13</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alt-Med"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Andrew Wakefield"/><category term="antivax"/><category term="Bruce Critelli"/><category term="Jamie Bernstein"/><title type="html">Wakefield’s walk of shame</title><published>2010-06-01T15:30:10Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T15:30:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/ZnUtTjWsNL0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/01/wakefields-walk-of-shame/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read this blog for more than 8 nanoseconds, you know I have no love for Andrew Wakefield. Founder of the modern antivax movement, disgraced researcher, discredited &amp;quot;doctor&amp;quot;, and at least partly to blame for the rise in preventable illnesses, his impact has made the world a worse place. The Sceptic’s Book of Pooh-Pooh &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/05/29/callous-unethical-and-dishonest-wakefield-finally-gets-struck-off/"&gt;totally eviscerates Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, holding nothing back. If you have any question about this guy’s horrifying history, then go read that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, he claims he is being persecuted, victimized, etc. etc. Baloney. What has actually happened is that the forces of science and reality have called his bluff. The problem is, he still hasn’t folded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the collapse perhaps, is imminent. &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;Skeptical Teacher has the story&lt;/a&gt; of a recent antivax rally to support Wakefield. Several skeptics showed up at this event, including Bruce Critelli and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/uajamie"&gt;Jamie Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;. You may be amused by this picture they took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/wakefield-skepticninjas.jpg" alt="wakefield-skepticninjas" title="wakefield-skepticninjas" width="496" height="376"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie gave Wakefield a note, which he said he’d read later. I wish I could’ve been there when he did. The note said:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;    Dear Andrew Wakefield,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    I know that you truly believe that what you are doing is helping people and that the ends justify the means, but I just want you to know that the things you are doing –- the actions you have taken in the past have hurt people –- killed people. Your work has scared and manipulated parents into not vaccinating their children, putting them and their entire community at risk, all in the name of safety. Children have died because of you. I just want to make sure that you fully understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
    Jamie &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BANG! I know he’s heard this a lot before, but somehow I think having a note like that handed to him at a rally for him to read later may actually hit home. It won’t change his mind at all — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/24/andrew-wakefield-martyr/"&gt;he has way too much invested in his antivax garbage&lt;/a&gt; — but I sure hope he loses some sleep over it. I know a lot of parents have lost sleep due to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your further schadenfreude,&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/my-day-at-an-anti-vaccination-rally/"&gt; Jamie recounts the events of that day&lt;/a&gt;, Bruce &lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/12084050"&gt;posted some video&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-skeptical-pwnage-of-darth-wakefield-his-anti-vax-woosters-continues/"&gt;Skeptical Teacher has comments and some links&lt;/a&gt;. You may be amused to note that claims of hundreds of attendees to the rally turn out to be like every other antivaxxer claim: hot air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, while Wakefield still attempts to twist reality into a Möbius strip, &lt;a href="http://vaccinecentral.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/winnebago-county-reports-a-whooping-cough-outbreak/"&gt;whooping cough is on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://vaccinecentral.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/vaccine-preventalbe-death-callie-grace-van-tornhout/"&gt;we lose more babies because people don’t get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is — to stretch the poker analogy I used above — while we hold all the cards, what Wakefield and his followers are betting is the health and safety of every person on the planet, including babies. Those stakes are simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past month, the devastating BP spill that began April 20th has become catastrophic in scale. And that's an understatement.

When I checked on my inbox early May, it was overflowing with questions from our readers about oil's impact on the marine realm, its potential to spread, and the long-term possibilities across sectors. Foremost, I want to thank Wallace J. Nichols and Philip Hoffman for posting in my absence when I asked them to provide details. Chris has also done a good job covering the reasons we should all be concerned about the 2010 hurricane forecast.

In short, the BP oil spill is as bad as it gets. It's an unprecedented social, environmental, and economic disaster in the US. And it's not over. The public seems to have expected that scientists and engineers would have a quick fix immediately--not surprising given that on television, problems take less than an hour to solve (with commercials). Now any fix will do, but no one's sure what we're dealing with 5000 feet below sea level. I haven't kept up with all of the coverage while overseas, though I'm sure much of what I'd say about the tragedy itself would be repetitious. ...

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be buying it, simply because he’s always interesting and witty, even when he’s wrong.  In this respect he’s the Orwell of our generation.  I thought I’d collect some of the major reviews (and excerpts) here if you want opinions before buying.  Since the book came out in the UK on May 20, most of these are British:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/30/christopher-hitchens-hitch-22-memoir"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/22/christopher-hitchens-decca-aitkenhead"&gt;a snarky interview&lt;/a&gt; with Hitch by Decca Aikenhead)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portrait of Hitchens to emerge from this book, then, is at odds with  his self-image. He thinks of himself as an ironist, permanently alert  to the contradictions of the world, a master of negative capability. In  fact, he’s a born polemicist, only fully alive when marshalling all his  forces to advance a particular cause. His critics accuse him of being a  professional controversialist, taking up positions merely in order to be  given the opportunity to defend them in print and on television. But  few traces of such opportunism are detectable in this memoir. On the  contrary, it’s the absence of cynicism that’s so striking. He’s an  ideologue, as full of passionate intensity when defending George Bush Jr  as he was when attacking Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/hitch22-a-memoir-by-christopher-hitchens-1984845.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rushdie fatwa brings out the combative best in his writing; his call  for “a    bit of character and guts and integrity,” his willingness to put    himself in the firing line, his lack of patience with anyone who  doesn’t    feel like joining him. His musings on Islamophobia and the need for    executive action against Saddam Hussein read too much like essays –  until he    tells the story of Mark Jennings Daily, a young Californian who went  off to    Iraq to fight, and die, for a war in which he believed because of  Hitchens’s    writings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article7131889.ece"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; of London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is far more in this engaging book than fury. Hitchens is a  vain man but he has much to be vain about: intelligence, wit, style,  charm, a prodigious memory and a fluency in debate that brings packed  houses to wherever he expounds his views. He declares his favourite word  in the English language to be “library” and he has indeed read and  remembers a very great deal. Auden, Dawkins, Clare, Orwell and Joyce are  cited on the first two pages. Yet this is not a bookish life: Hitchens  has been out and about wherever the action is: Prague, Poland, Sarajevo,  Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, sometimes arrested, often duffed up. This is  no coward’s tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7768160/Hitch-22-by-Christopher-Hitchens-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More striking than the way in which the content of his opinions has  changed,    however, is the continuity in the manner in which he has held those    opinions. He likes to think of himself as a rational sceptic, but he  isn’t    really: his views are more visceral than that, his lurches from one  deeply    held position to the next driven mostly by gut instinct. Fine orator  and    fluent writer though he is, he’s never been much of an analytical  thinker,    and his style of argument proceeds more by a series of emphatic,  emotive and    stylish assertions (he magnificently denounces Argentina’s General  Videla as    looking ‘like a cretin impersonating a toothbrush’), by appeals to  common    sense and common feeling, than by logical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/review/memoirs_of_a_pugilist.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Hitchens cares so deeply about  literary judgments (his oeuvre is almost devoid of references to  painters, dancers, musicians, and filmmakers), let it be said that, at  the level of the sentence and the paragraph, the writing in &lt;em&gt;Hitch-22&lt;/em&gt; is mostly gorgeous. But the book feels too long and too uneven: some  chapters are lean, others are bloated. In the latter, Hitchens is like a  jazz saxophonist who crams too many notes into his solos. Names clog  the pages: “My later friend Jessica Mitford . . . my Argentine  anti-fascist friend Jacobo Timerman . . . my beloved friend Christopher  Buckley.” My patience gave out when I reached the chapter about Martin  Amis, in which the speed of the name-dropping—and the intensity of the  backslapping and self-satisfaction—becomes insufferable. We are supposed  to be impressed that the young Amis recited, from memory, “a  spine-tingling rendition of Humbert Humbert’s last verbal duel with  Quilty,” and that “Martin has done the really hard thinking about  handjobs.” If an enemy of Hitchens were to write about a friend in such  gushing terms, Hitchens would annihilate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/28/AR2010052802265.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The  Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been said by unkind people that an honest politician is one who,  once bought, stays bought. So is an honest journalist one who, once  bamboozled, stays bamboozled? Call me naive — please! — but I’m  floored that the great dirt-digger still clings to the certainty,  peddled by Paul Wolfowitz and Ahmed Chalabi and long since discredited,  that the late Saddam Hussein was unseated for his tyranny and his  possession of weapons of mass destruction. Tyranny? Has Hitchens seen  what we’re still sucking up to? Most tyrants, of course, aren’t  squatting atop a quarter of the world’s known oil reserves. Even Alan  Greenspan wrote in his 2007 memoir that it was “politically inconvenient  to acknowledge what everyone knows: The Iraq war is largely about oil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/28/RV6R1DIOS1.DTL"&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, Hitchens’ mother didn’t live to see very much of this. She  killed herself in Athens in the early 1970s, as part of a suicide pact  with her lover. Hitchens’ account of the death and the task he faced  arranging her funeral in Greece, dealing with corrupt officials and  clergy, displays a tenderness and emotional depth that isn’t always  present in the rest of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only much later that Hitchens discovered that his mother, and  therefore he, was Jewish. In some ways it seems surprising that Hitchens  makes so much of his Jewishness. A true nonbeliever might be expected  to regard it with genuine indifference. In any case, these two  revelations of maternal suicide and ethnicity would be more than enough  for many a memoir, but Hitchens gives us far more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Hitchens discussing his book in a two-part interview (total: 15 minutes) with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It’s well worth watching, especially for the bits on his mother (first video) and on Iraq (second video).&lt;/p&gt;

I posted only &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/" title=""&gt;127 times&lt;/a&gt; in May. Apart from many cool videos and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/various_updates_1.php" title=""&gt;various updates&lt;/a&gt;, I did blog about other things as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the WWW2010 conference and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/public_vs_publicized_future_of.php" title=""&gt;wrote my thoughts about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Laboratory submissions are in full swing so I decided to post the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/open_laboratory_-_old_prefaces.php" title=""&gt;old Prefaces and Introductions&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for the first three books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dennis Meredith came to town to talk about Explaining Research so &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/explaining_research_with_denni_1.php" title=""&gt;I reported from the event&lt;/a&gt;. I also reported on the presentation about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/serious_gaming_at_sigma_xi_1.php" title=""&gt;Serious Gaming at Sigma Xi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of my friends and neighbors published books in May so I announced the sites and times for local readings - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/on_the_grid_is_coming_in_two_d.php" title=""&gt;'On The Grid' by Scott Huler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/bonobo_handshake_coming_soon_t.php" title=""&gt;'Bonobo Handshake' by Vanessa Woods&lt;/a&gt;. I reported from the 'On The Grid' reading &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scott_huler_-_on_the_grid_at_q.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Both book reviews are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cory Doctorow did a book reading/signing in Chapel Hill - I went and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/cory_doctorow_in_chapel_hill.php" title=""&gt;wrote about the event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Over at Yale Environment 360, I take a look at how they will behave in a world warming up as we inject carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Will they draw down some of the extra CO2, or will the heat spur them to spew out more? Or both? The answer isn’t clear yet, but it’s important.

I’d love to go and spend more time… especially when I see as lovely a view of &lt;em&gt;L’hexagone&lt;/em&gt; as this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/44000/44124/ISS023-E-029061_lrg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/iss_view_france.jpg" alt="iss_view_france" title="iss_view_france" width="610" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to engrandenate.] &lt;em&gt;C’est magnifique! C’est belle!&lt;/em&gt; It looks like a beach picture, the Moon shining down on the coastline, clouds gently wafting over the horizon…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, wait a second. That isn’t a picture taken from the beach! That’s taken &lt;em&gt;from space!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oui&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=44124"&gt;This shot&lt;/a&gt;, taken from the International Space Station, is looking southwest at France (and a little bit of Italy), but from several hundred kilometers above it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It was taken at nearly midnight on April 28. The view is not straight down, but at an angle; about 60° from straight down, or 30° down from horizontal (if I’ve done the math correctly; the law of cosines was a little tricky for this one, but I got the data from &lt;a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/sseop/photo.pl?mission=ISS023&amp;amp;roll=E&amp;amp;frame=29061"&gt;the NASA site&lt;/a&gt;). At the moment it was taken, the center of the picture was about 650 km (400 miles) away from the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this picture! What you think at first is the Moon is actually moonlight reflecting off the water of the Ligurian Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean between France and Italy. Corsica can be seen to the upper left. Also visible are Marseille (to the right), Lyons (at the bottom) and Torino in Italy to the left (bonus astronomy goodness: a decade ago, Torino hosted a meeting for astronomers, who concocted &lt;a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/torino_scale.html"&gt;the Torino Scale&lt;/a&gt; of how dangerous an Earth-buzzing asteroid is). Since it was midnight, the lights of the cities glow softly from this distance. You can also see the gentle blue reflected moonlight off snow-capped Alps in the center, interspersed with the light cloud cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot we can learn from observing our home planet from space, but perhaps the most important — and the one with the most lasting impact — is just how beautiful it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. I was listening to Debussy’s &amp;quot;Claire de Lune&amp;quot; as I wrote this, and when it ended, went right to &amp;quot;Prelude a L’Apres Midi d’un Faune&amp;quot;. &lt;/em&gt;C’est vrai!&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps the reason is that, unlike homeopathy, which based on physics, chemistry, and biology alone is so implausible that, for it to "work," huge swaths of well-established physics and chemistry would have to be shown to be not just wrong but extravagantly and outrageously wrong (making homeopathy far more akin to magic than science), or reiki, which, when you come right down to it, is nothing more than faith healing based on Eastern mysticism rather than Christianity, acupuncture actually involves doing something physical. Indeed, at the risk of annoying or boring long time readers, who have seen me write this many times before, even I used to think that there might be something to acupuncture. Certainly, I recognized that the concepts of meridians along which life energy (qi) flows and how sticking needles into just the right locations on these meridians somehow "unblocks" the flow of qi and thereby relieves pain and heals disease was prescientific nonsense on the order of thinking that evil spirits cause disease. Such ideas may have made sense hundreds of years ago, before scientists developed an understanding of how the body works, but now, in 2010, they are vestiges of a time when medicine really had close to no idea how the body works and when medicine was more often worse than the disease being treated.

Yet the fascination with acupuncture remains, so much so that an inordinate amount of research dollars are spent on studying it. Of course, as Steve Novella has pointed out, in general in medicine (at least these days), the trajectory of research is from bench research to animal models to small scale, less rigorous, pilot studies in humans to large scale, rigorously designed studies using many subjects. True, this order doesn't always hold. For instance, if physicians make a compelling observation "at the bedside" of response to therapy or how a disease progresses, frequently, after making closer observations to confirm the initial observation, researchers will jump back to animal models and bench top research to try to figure out what's going on. For such a progression to be useful, though, scientists have to be sure that the phenomenon in human patients under study actually exists. Unfortunately, such is not the case for acupuncture. As larger, more well designed studies using real placebo or sham acupuncture techniques, have increasingly shown that acupuncture does not function any better than placebo in human beings (and sometimes even worse), acupuncturists and acupuncture believers have been reversing the usual order of things, doing smaller studies and "pragmatic" (i.e., uncontrolled) clinical trials, where the placebo effect is not controlled for. Never mind that it doesn't matter where the needles are placed (thus blowing the whole "meridian" idea out of the water) or even if the needles puncture the skin. Toothpicks work just as well as needles. Also never mind that the mythology of acupuncture as having been routinely practiced for over two thousand years (or, sometimes, four thousand years, is largely a creation of Chairman Mao, who elevated what was a marginal practice at the time to a modality that the state supported and promoted (1,2,3,4). Unfortunately, even the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) falls for this mythology.

Sometimes, acupuncture studies even end up in high impact journals like Nature Neuroscience. Of course, what is being studied is not really "acupuncture" per se, but rather sticking needles into either people or animals. Since a bunch of you have deluged my mail box with this particular study, I felt obligated to have a look at it. Before I get to the study itself, though, let's take a look at the press release: Read the rest of this post... | Read the comments on this post......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Laden is cheerfully dismissive of the arguments raised in such discussions. But his scorn doesn't change the facts of the case, which are roughly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Without a careful definition of what you mean by "word" and by "language X", questions like "how many words are there in language X" are pretty much meaningless, because different definitions will yield very different numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The same thing applies, with the added issue of what you mean by &amp;quot;know&amp;quot;, to the question of &amp;quot;how many words of language X does a specific person know?&amp;quot; Another layer of variation is added by generalizing the question to &amp;quot;how many words of language X does an average four-year-old or 18-year-old know?&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s an obvious answer, subject to the usual sampling-error problems, but the result is a bit like asking about average income — the mean value may not be very useful in telling you what you really want to know about the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Most sensible definitions for (1) and (2) above create serious practical difficulties for counting. That is, they define an  answer, but the prescribed process for finding it is hard to carry out, and especially hard to automate in a way that produces an accurate result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Extrapolating accurately from samples raises its own special problems here — for a discussion of some of these difficulties, see &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs502/LNRE.html"&gt;this set of lecture notes&lt;/a&gt;, or read Harald Baayen's book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frequency-Distributions-Speech-Language-Technology/dp/1402009275"&gt;Word  Frequency Distributions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Despite all these difficulties, researchers over the years have gone through the steps of defining carefully what they mean by "word", "language", "know", etc., and then carried out these steps. Some classical references are M. Graves, "&lt;a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0091-732X%281986%2913%3C49%3AVLAI%3E2.0.CO;2-K"&gt;Vocabulary  Learning and Instruction&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Review of Research in Education&lt;/em&gt;,  13 49-89, 1986; W.E. Nagy &amp;amp; R.C. Anderson, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0034-0553%28198421%2919%3A3%3C304%3AHMWATI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L"&gt;How  many words are there in printed school English?&lt;/a&gt;" &lt;em&gt;Reading  Research Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; 19, 304-330, 1984. [(added later) They've done this because the (suitable qualified) answers matter to various scientific and technological questions: How much word-learning, and of what kind, do children need to do in the course of learning a language? How many entries does a lexicon need to have in order to get X% of coverage on task Y? etc.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Comparisons across languages are made more difficult by the fact that the most natural and sensible answers to questions like those in (1) tend to be different in different languages. Furthermore, a decision that may have only a small effect on the results in language X, may turn out to change things by an order of magnitude or more in language Y. Again, this doesn't make it impossible to answer the questions, it just increases yet again the range of sensible values that answers might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laden is radically impatient with all this talk about how it all depends and it&amp;#39;s hard to tell, but his impatience doesn&amp;#39;t change the facts. Nor does it change the fact that there are plenty of attempts to answer such questions — one of the &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2001/ling001/homework3.html"&gt;standard assignments&lt;/a&gt; in my LING 001 course asks students to use a dictionary-sampling method to estimate the size of their passive vocabulary in English. Of course, I also explain some of the reasons that the estimated numbers are not very meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laden seems to be aware of these issues — for example, he found the Nagy and Anderson reference — but his goal in the cited post seems to be to make fun of people rather than to clarify the questions and answers.  (He suggests, towards the start of his post, that he wants to evaluate claims about the rate of word learning by children — but I couldn&amp;#39;t see any connection between this issue and the rest of his hyper-kinetic complaining about the difficulty of getting a simple answer to the word-counting question.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275399918834"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=180290">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f286c4066e035dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="1-800-FLOWERS"/><category term="adult relationships"/><category term="baby boomers"/><category term="bikini wax"/><category term="bikini waxing"/><category term="boyfriends"/><category term="breast implants"/><category term="criminal record"/><category term="dating"/><category term="dating advice"/><category term="dating dilemmas"/><category term="dating sites"/><category term="detoxifying foods"/><category term="divorce"/><category term="divorce rate"/><category term="facebook"/><category term="Facebook status updates"/><category term="falling in love"/><category term="flickr"/><category term="google"/><category term="Googling"/><category term="Huffington Post"/><category term="iphone"/><category term="iPhone users"/><category term="John Cusack"/><category term="journalism"/><category term="marriage"/><category term="Marvel comics"/><category term="nutrition"/><category term="oral sex"/><category term="oversharers"/><category term="oversharing"/><category term="PeopleFinder"/><category term="Relationships"/><category term="romantic relationships"/><category term="sex"/><category term="sex and dating"/><category term="sex on the first date"/><category term="twitter"/><category term="Twitter feed"/><title type="html">Dating Rules: Google Is a Girl’s Best Friend</title><published>2010-06-01T13:08:54Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T13:08:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/dating-rules-google-is-a-girl%e2%80%99s-best-friend/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-180296" href="http://blisstree.com/live/dating-rules-google-is-a-girl%e2%80%99s-best-friend/attachment/bn362054/"&gt;&lt;img title="bn362054" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/06/89794786-280x186.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="186"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dear Potential Suitors,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how you ended up on Blisstree, since it’s filled with stories about bikini waxing, detoxifying foods, alternatives to milk, breast implants, and what we women stick up our vaginas. Well, maybe the last two interest you. But chances are, you happened upon this story by Googling my name. Maybe I met you at a friend’s party, or perhaps on one of those dating websites that continue to prove I am a glutton for punishment. We may have already shared in a few drinks, some idle conversation, eye contact, a laugh or two, a hug, or maybe a little smooch goodbye. One of us may have remarked that we should get together again. It’s even possible that we have yet to go on date #1, and you’re just doing some preliminary research. I don’t blame you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To imagine dating before Google is like picturing the 80s without John Cusack films. What did our parents do before you could properly screen your date? Well, judging from the divorce rate among baby boomers (estimated to be more than 50%), you got married and horrified and divorced. Or, at least, that’s what my mother did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you don’t &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/feel/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=feel&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;feel&lt;/a&gt; threatened by what I am about to tell you. My potential boyfriend research is pretty thorough. (Hello, Master’s in journalism!) I start with a rudimentary Googling, and then I’ll parlay clues, like the user name that keeps popping up in comments on websites and also happens to be the name on your blog – touche33, artbruttt, or what have you. And I’m just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One chick I know goes so far as to hit websites like PeopleFinder. I don’t bother, because those sites don’t really tell me much, usually just your last four addresses, the property you or your family owns, and maybe your mother’s maiden name. Amateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not searching for info on your criminal or driving record, or even your net worth. And, though it may seem like it to you, I am not a stalker. However, I am very sick of dating closet douche bags, and I’d like some assurance that you’re a kind and decent human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that a recent study reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/facebook-tmi-and-online-o_n_579205.html"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that 32% of Internet users overshare personal info online, while nearly 60% of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/iphone/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=iphone&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; users admit to feeling poster’s remorse. (For the record, this letter doesn’t count as oversharing, since it’s been vetted by my &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/team/"&gt;trusty editor&lt;/a&gt;, and because I would happily disclose all of this over a beer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, it wasn’t until I moved from a casual to a more serious relationship with Google that I discovered how the World Wide Web tends to illuminate one’s true character. Usually, the bad qualities rise to the surface more readily than the virtuous ones – like on the first page or two of a Google trail – though sometimes it takes a little more digging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, a handsome comic book writer managed to date me for close to four months and hide the fact that he had a loving, long-term (and possibly pregnant) girlfriend at home. We connected on a dating site, and I did a casual Google before we met face-to-face. I found a geeky Twitter feed (140 characters of Marvel comic mania, obscure graphic novels, and enthused reports on the progress on his own books), comments he’d made on other people’s blogs, a professional website, plus some press coverage of his strip. All of it was pretty innocuous, though I didn’t get most of his pop culture references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I abruptly stopped hearing from him, I hopped back online and examined &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/facebook/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=facebook&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, various comic websites, and Flickr. It finally came together when I cross-referenced his and her Twitter feeds. I learned of the couple’s morning coffee ritual, a recently opened shared bank account, a dying house cat, and their shithole-of-an-apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later I received a 1-800-FLOWERS delivery, a mixed bouquet more appropriate for your mother than your mistress. The card informed me that I was lovely. I decided to respond via email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear ____________,&lt;br&gt;
Thanks for the flowers. You’re an asshole. Please give my best to your lovely girl friend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Vanessa is a Research Scientist in Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and studies the cognition of chimpanzees and bonobos in Congo.

The following is a modified excerpt from Bonobo Handshake.

In 1988, a crane operator called Joe Honner was digging out telegraph poles on Darrell Tree’s farm in South Australia. Joe’s three-year-old son was sitting with him in the cabin while Joe maneuvered the crane.

Suddenly, the crane swung into live telegraph wires. Over nineteen thousand volts of electricity shot through the broken wires into the crane, which, being made of metal, was a superb conductor. Joe jumped clear, but his son was stuck in the cabin. Joe rushed forward to get his son, but he was held back by the farmer, Darrell. The little boy was fine, Darrell said, as long as he didn’t move. The electricity wound around the crane, creating a perfect circuit, but the leather interior of the cabin was untouched. The boy was frightened and started to cry. As Darrell turned to get a rope to rescue him, Joe rushed forward. As soon as he touched the crane, he tapped into the circuit ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F06%2F01%2Fare-only-humans-good-samaritans%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275393882732"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AgriculturalBiodiversityWeblog/~3/Ay6V8fjE_Rk/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b296bb3190fe7a4b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Learning from Kibale’s failure</title><published>2010-06-01T03:47:24Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T03:47:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/QPoZ25gkeDY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AgriculturalBiodiversityWeblog/~3/Ay6V8fjE_Rk/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">It must have sounded like a great idea at the time.

That is, you don&amp;#39;t have a sneak preview of what your own words sound like before you utter them. That&amp;#39;s according to Falk Huettig and Robert Hartsuiker who say their finding has implications for our understanding of the brain&amp;#39;s internal monitoring processes.The researchers took advantage of an established effect whereby the sound of a spoken word draws our eyes automatically towards written words that sound similar. Forty-eight Dutch-speaking undergrads were presented with a succession of line drawings, each of which appeared alongside three written words. The participants&amp;#39; task was to name out loud the objects in the drawings. Meanwhile the researchers monitored their eye movements.On each trial, one of the written words sounded like the name of the drawn object - for example, for a drawing of a heart (&amp;#39;hart&amp;#39; in Dutch), the accompanying words were: harp (also &amp;#39;harp&amp;#39; in English), zetel (&amp;#39;couch&amp;#39;) and raam (&amp;#39;window&amp;#39;). As expected, after saying the word &amp;#39;hart&amp;#39;, the participants eyes were drawn to the word &amp;#39;harp&amp;#39;. The key question was whether this happened earlier than in previous studies in which participants heard the target words spoken by someone else rather than by themselves. If we hear our own speech internally, before we utter it, then the participants&amp;#39; eyes should have been drawn to the similar sounding words earlier than if they&amp;#39;d heard another person&amp;#39;s utterances.In fact, the participants eyes were drawn to the similar sounding words with a latency (around 300ms) that suggested they&amp;#39;d only heard their own utterances once they were public. There were was no sneak internal perceptual preview.It&amp;#39;s important to clarify: we definitely do monitor our speech internally. For example, speakers can detect their speech errors even when their vocal utterances are masked by noise. What this new research suggests is that this internal monitoring isn&amp;#39;t done perceptually - we don&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;hear&amp;#39; a pre-release copy of our own utterances. What&amp;#39;s the alternative? Huettig and Hartsuiker said error-checking is somehow built into the speech production system, but they admit: &amp;#39;there are presently no elaborated theories of [this] alternative viewpoint.&amp;#39;_________________________________Huettig, F., &amp;amp; Hartsuiker, R.

However, there has been one thing [OK, more than one thing] bothering me about this paper... But first, a quick summary of the Methods which were rather straightforward.Filippi and colleagues (2010) recruited 20 omnivores, 19 vegetarians, and 20 vegans to participate in a study that examined their brain responses to images of human and animal suffering. They were naïve as to the goals of the experiment. Before entering the scanner, all participants completed the Empathy Quotient, a 40 item questionnaire [plus 20 filler questions] that rates one&amp;#39;s level of empathy (Baron-Cohen &amp;amp; Wheelwright, 2004). And the omnivores did indeed have lower EQ scores (38.8) than the vegetarians (49.5) and the vegans (44.6), who did not differ from each other.The fMRI experiment used an......event-related design during observation of negative affective  pictures of human beings and animals (showing mutilations, murdered  people, human/animal threat, tortures, wounds, etc.). Participants saw  negative-valence scenes related to humans and animals, alternating with  natural landscapes. So what were the neuroimaging findings? To no one&amp;#39;s surprise, results indicated differences between the groups, as shown below.Figure 3. Results of the between-group comparisons of emotional (human and animal) negative valence picture views. Results are superimposed on a high resolution T1-weighted image in the standard MNI space, at a threshold of p less than 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons. Areas activated during human picture view in vegetarians  and vegans vs. omnivores are shown in yellow. Activations  specific for vegetarians are shown in blue. Activations specific for  vegans are shown in red. A: human picture view; B: animal picture view. [NOTE: I&amp;#39;ve labeled the corpus callosum.]Also to no one&amp;#39;s surprise, differences between the groups were more  pronounced for animal pictures (Fig. 3B) than for human pictures (Fig.  3A).Some of the results were interpreted in Rorschach inkblot  fashion: the authors saw want they wanted to see in them. Since when are the specific regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) shown above primarily known as &amp;quot;empathy-related regions&amp;quot;? They&amp;#39;re not.2...vegetarians and vegans have constantly an  higher engagement of empathy related areas while observing negative  scenes, independently of the species of the individuals involved, which  is characterized by an increased recruitment of the ACC and the IFG.  Increased activation in the ACC and left IFG in vegetarians and vegans  during human and animal suffering view is likely to reflect a stronger  empathic response in the first two groups.Curiously enough, the amygdala  (a limbic structure important  for emotion) was not activated by animal suffering in either the  vegetarians or the vegans. Although the amygdala (LeDoux,  2007) is  predominantly known for its role in fear conditioning,  it is also activated by other emotional responses including disgust  (e.g., Kober et  al., 2008).Remarkably, the within-group analysis during animal picture view, showed  the absence of signal changes (in terms of activations and  deactivations) within the amygdala in vegetarians and vegans, suggesting  a down-regulation of amygdala response from areas located in the  frontal lobes, in an attempt to regulate emotion through cortical  processes in these subjects.Why would the vegetarians and vegans attempt to downregulate their emotional responses to animal suffering? And why would the vegans show greater amygdala responses to human suffering than did the omnivores and vegetarians??Figure 4. Interactions between stimuli (animal/human) and groups (omnivore/vegetarian/vegan). (A) An interaction was found in the right amygdala, indicating greater increase to animal negative valence picture view in omnivores and to human negative valence picture view in vegans. An interaction between “human pictures” and “vegan group” was also found in the left amygdala.Previously, NeuroKüz  mentioned some objections to the study design in a post on The  empathetic vegetarian brain.1 I won&amp;#39;t detail his critique here other than to  summarize:The control condition consisted of “neutral” scenes that did not  include living beings, faces, or suffering of any kind.Participants passively viewed the photos, they did not have to  respond by indicating their emotional reactions.Participants could be desensitized to human suffering by watching  the news. One of the greatest issues, in my view, is with the mode of stimulus presentation. The event-related design (which is usually preferable) may not have allowed adequate time between pictures to &amp;quot;recover&amp;quot; from the shock of seeing a mutilated human or animal. If this were especially true for vegetarians and vegans viewing images of animal suffering, it could explain the curious silence of the amygdala. In such scenario, a blocked design (presenting all stimuli of one category in blocks, rather than intermixed) might have been a better idea.The vegetarians and vegans in this study all made their dietary choices for ethical reasons. It is quite conceivable that they differed from the omnivores on any number of other dimensions. For example, evolutionary psychology extremist Satoshi Kanazawa recently blogged about Why Vegetarians Are More Intelligent than Meat Eaters, but this only held for a UK sample born in 1958, but not for a US sample born b...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

But can observing animal behavior lead the observer to make inferences about brain anatomy? Can observing animal behavior tell us something about the evolution of the brain?

Figure 1: Like the raccoon says.

Let's say you have two very very closely related species. You might even call them congeneric, because they are from the same taxonomic genus. In most ways, these two species are very similar, but they differ behaviorally in some very big ways. Might those behavioral differences predict neurobiological differences?

Perhaps the reason is that, unlike homeopathy, which based on physics, chemistry, and biology alone is so implausible that, for it to "work," huge swaths of well-established physics and chemistry would have to be shown to be not just wrong but extravagantly and outrageously wrong (making homeopathy &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/05/doctor_strange_and_the_only_way_to_make.php"&gt;far more akin to magic than science&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, which, when you come right down to it, is nothing more than &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/reiki_versus_the_catholic_church.php"&gt;faith healing based on Eastern mysticism&lt;/a&gt; rather than Christianity, acupuncture actually involves doing something physical. Indeed, at the risk of annoying or boring long time readers, who have seen me write this many times before, even I used to think that there might be something to acupuncture. Certainly, I recognized that the concepts of meridians along which life energy (&lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;) flows and how sticking needles into just the right locations on these meridians somehow "unblocks" the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt; and thereby relieves pain and heals disease was prescientific nonsense on the order of thinking that evil spirits cause disease. Such ideas may have made sense hundreds of years ago, before scientists developed an understanding of how the body works, but now, in 2010, they are vestiges of a time when medicine really had close to no idea how the body works and when medicine was more often worse than the disease being treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2010/05/when_what_an_acupuncture_study_shows_is/acupuncture.jpg" width="450" height="367" alt="acupuncture.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the fascination with acupuncture remains, so much so that an inordinate amount of research dollars are spent on studying it. Of course, as &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1609"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out, in general in medicine (at least these days), the trajectory of research is from bench research to animal models to small scale, less rigorous, pilot studies in humans to large scale, rigorously designed studies using many subjects. True, this order doesn't always hold. For instance, if physicians make a compelling observation "at the bedside" of response to therapy or how a disease progresses, frequently, after making closer observations to confirm the initial observation, researchers will jump back to animal models and bench top research to try to figure out what's going on. For such a progression to be useful, though, scientists have to be sure that the phenomenon in human patients under study actually exists. Unfortunately, such is not the case for acupuncture. As larger, more well designed studies using real placebo or sham acupuncture techniques, have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/yawnanother_acupuncture_study.php"&gt;increasingly shown&lt;/a&gt; that acupuncture &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/the_largest_randomized_acupuncture_study.php"&gt;does not function&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/another_acupuncture_study_misinterpreted.php"&gt;any better than placebo&lt;/a&gt; in human beings (and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/sham_acupuncture_is_better_than_true_acu.php"&gt;sometimes even worse&lt;/a&gt;), acupuncturists and acupuncture believers have been reversing the usual order of things, doing smaller studies and "pragmatic" (i.e., uncontrolled) clinical trials, where the placebo effect is not controlled for. Never mind that it doesn't matter where the needles are placed (thus blowing the whole "meridian" idea out of the water) or even if the needles puncture the skin. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/another_acupuncture_study_misinterpreted.php"&gt;Toothpicks work just as well as needles&lt;/a&gt;. Also never mind that the mythology of acupuncture as having been routinely practiced for over two thousand years (or, sometimes, four thousand years, is largely a creation of Chairman Mao, who elevated what was a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=583"&gt;marginal practice&lt;/a&gt; at the time to a modality that the state supported and promoted (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=131"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=494"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=505"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, even the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=566"&gt;falls for this mythology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, acupuncture studies even end up in high impact journals like &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, what is being studied is not really "acupuncture" per se, but rather sticking needles into either people or animals. Since a bunch of you have deluged my mail box with this particular study, I felt obligated to have a look at it. Before I get to the study itself, though, let's take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=2880"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/when_what_an_acupuncture_study_shows_is.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/when_what_an_acupuncture_study_shows_is.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/11zF03dNzWY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275391790495"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=180189">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed219e0611ef3710</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Charles Dickens"/><category term="quote"/><title type="html">Charles Dickens on Chocolate</title><published>2010-06-01T11:00:28Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T11:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/charles-dickens-on-chocolate/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is nothing better than a friend, unless it is a friend with chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

[It] chronicles history’s vast and colorful cast of true believers — from the hidden side of the Bible’s eccentric characters to today’s street-corner doomsayers, and from extraterrestrial communicators, levitating hermits, and flagellating ascetics to self-serving preachers of overindulgence who believed money, sex, and drugs were the keys to the portal to divine understanding. In addition to the firewalkers, serpent handlers, cultists, terrorists, and alleged time travelers, &lt;em&gt;God’s Lunatics&lt;/em&gt; also reveals the dubious foundations of the world’s major faiths and the many religious customs and laws that continue to influence governments and society, whether you are a believer or not.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com"&gt;Again – the website to refer to is http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; – The Perth Skeptics will be there from 6pm onwards at the coffee shop tonight at the library.&lt;/strong&gt; Look for the Meetup.com sign and me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/7323001/anti-vaccine-forum-causes-row/"&gt;The West Australian – Anti-Vaccine Forum Causes Row&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A political row has broken out over the State Library’s decision to allow an anti-vaccination group to hold a public forum at its Northbridge premises tonight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two weeks ago, the Uniting Church had a last-minute change of heart and cancelled an Australian Vaccination Network forum scheduled to be held at one of its city properties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The network’s spokeswoman, Meryl Dorey, told followers that network members in Perth had “excellent contacts with larger and better venues … and we are hoping to reschedule this talk for some time within the next four weeks”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Shadow arts minister John Hyde said the Barnett Government had opened the floodgates for any group to use the library’s facilities to push their agendas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Does this mean that the Liberal Party can hold a membership drive there, or for that matter the Ku Klux Klan or a bike gang?” Mr Hyde said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He said the State Government should not have allowed the group to use the library to push its anti-vaccine message. “Why should a group that endangers the lives of WA children be allowed to speak and promote their cause at a taxpayer-funded venue dedicated to learning?” Mr Hyde said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Their dangerous propaganda which is putting children at risk of polio, smallpox, cholera and other preventable diseases should not be able to gain respectability by using the good name of the State Library.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yesterday, the chief executive of the State Library, Margaret Allen, refused to say how the group, which has been criticised by health authorities for discouraging parents from having their children vaccinated, was able to book the library for its forum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead she issued a brief statement that said the library provided facilities and services to the community of WA as a whole. “Inevitably from time to time this may include interest groups with views that some may find controversial,” she said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1198-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Michael Shermer and Tony Blair" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shermer and Tony Blair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Last week I attended the Khosla Ventures summit at Cavello Point in Sausalito, California, an ex-army base converted to a posh resort, where the venture capitalist (he calls himself a “venture assistant”) Vinod Khosla brings together start-up CEOs and their venture backers who are together innovating new science and technologies for alternative and environmentally efficient energy sources. Vinod heard my TED talk in Long Beach in February 2010 (to be posted at TED.com in June) and invited me to explain why people believe weird things about money (“The Mind of the Market”, based on my book of the same title). Vinod hosted a fireside chat with Bill Gates and Tony Blair, and in the Q &amp;amp; A I raised my hand and asked Tony a question. By way of background… &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since I am in the business of spreading good ideas and debunking bad ideas, I ask this question all the time of a diverse range of people, in search of different answers to this difficult question. I believe in the power of ideas to free people and empower them—a fundamental principle that was born of the Enlightenment—but I also recognize that not everyone shares this belief, and since one of those Enlightenment principles is the freedom to disagree and the right to think and believe whatever you want as long as it does not interfere with my rights, then we can’t force people to embrace these Enlightenment values. On the other hand, we are tribal and we still live in a world with walls that are guarded by men with guns, and there are other tribes who would just as well terminate our existence or replace our Constitutional liberties with theocratic rule, we need a strong military. Thus my question for Tony Blair, and his eloquent and insightful answer:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michael Shermer: “How can we spread liberal democracy, market capitalism, science, technology, education, the Internet, etc. globally, when there are people who are still essentially living in theocracies who, as you said, would just assume see us dead, who don’t believe in the education of women and children, who don’t believe in civil liberties and equal treatment under the law, etc., and how can we do so non-militarily? That is, how do we spread these ideas without imposing them on other people?”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tony Blair: “It’s one of the great myths perpetrated in our own societies is that somehow people who live in oppressive or backward looking governments actually prefer it that way and that we just don’t understand their culture. You will often hear this in certain countries about the role of women when it is usually men talking about it, but any time you get the opportunity to talk to any women in those countries separated from those who might overhear them, believe it or not they tell you that they would prefer to be free and equal.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“We have allies in this fight who are the people, most of whom want change. The thing is, however, you need the security means to stand up when you are confronted to answer back, and if you don’t you will get rolled over by them and there’s no use in thinking any different. However, the ultimate answer is not the force of arms but the force of ideas.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	“I think the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was the century of fundamentalist political ideology, but the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century is going to be about religious or cultural ideology. The single most important thing we can do is also to provide a basis for peaceful co-existence. The best way of defeating these ideas is with better ideas. The better idea that we have in our way of life is not just about freedom and democracy, although I think those are important elements, it’s also about a basic concept of justice—the basic idea that anyone, no matter what their background, will get a chance to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Shermer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275385220934"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=4885">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4fd2aadcd8308e94</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Arts"/><title type="html">The mother of all spiders</title><published>2010-06-01T09:37:04Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T09:37:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/GLm0K5KcwtY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/06/01/the-mother-of-all-spiders/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/06/maman.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/06/maman-300x225.jpg" alt="maman" title="maman" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Bourgeois"&gt;Louise Bourgeois&lt;/a&gt; died yesterday. Perhaps at that very moment I was in the garden of the &lt;a href="http://leeum.samsungfoundation.org/html/intro.asp"&gt;Leeum museum&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul being humbled by her sculpture, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maman"&gt;Maman&lt;/a&gt;. I had previously run into Maman at the Tate about a decade ago. She’s not someone you easily forget. At first all you notice is the immense, menacing, and tremendously unsettling spider. Then you notice that there’s a smaller spider nearby, perhaps a child. And then, much later, you notice that the larger spider has a sac at her belly, filled with eggs. She’s a mother (hence her name, which is french for the same). But this is not your canonical nurturing, soothing, swaddling mother figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Leeum museum is outstanding: an oasis in the heart of Seoul. The museum is split into 3 buildings, each distinct and marvelous (both architecturally, and for their contents). One wing consists entirely of ancient art, with a beautiful collection of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celadon"&gt;celadon&lt;/a&gt; (coming from someone that has always had trouble appreciating old pots and jars). One wing is an interactive space, encouraging you to be creative in various clever ways (and with lots to entertain children, who have no doubt suffered from hours of museum-going). The third wing is one of the most impressive small collections of contemporary art I have ever seen, including pieces by Warhol, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_close"&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole alcove devoted to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Barney"&gt;Barney&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cremaster_Cycle"&gt;Cremaster&lt;/a&gt; 3 running on a loop). My favorites by far were two beautiful pieces by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_richter"&gt;Richter&lt;/a&gt;: a photo-painting of two lit candles and a gorgeous abstract. As you leave the museum you wander into the garden, and confront the 3-story high mother in all her glory. There is something primal about the encounter, especially as the vast metropolis of Seoul stretches out in the distance below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Bourgeois is now gone, her spiders will no doubt haunt generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

Dick dream of electric sheep?&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip K Dick was  brought back to life as a fully autonomous  conversational android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of roboticists, computer scientists, designers, and  science fiction fans built a “robotic portrait” of the sci-fi author.  The project was a collaboration between Hanson Robotics, the University  of Memphis, and the Automation and Robotics Research Institute (ARRI) at  the University of Texas, Arlington. The android used cameras to track  visitors and turn to face them while talking. It used speech recognition  and speech synthesis software to listen and respond, and AI routines  that drew on Dick’s body of work to hold a natural conversation with  visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all we know the original Phillip K. Dick was a Replicant too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/31/death-penalty-could-await-man-who-broke-free-from-islam/"&gt;Muslim apostate in tiny island nation of The Maldives may face death penalty&lt;/a&gt; – Going against Islamic law in The Maldives is unconstitutional. Mohamed Nazim did though when he publicly declared himself to be not a Muslim. The penalty for his apostasy is death unless he “repents.” This is not what one should expect from a so-called “religion of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine to prevent breast cancer has shown overwhelmingly favorable  results in animals, according to &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.2161.html"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at &lt;a href="http://www.lerner.ccf.org/"&gt;Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner  Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that a single vaccination with the antigen a-lactalbumin  prevents breast cancer tumors from forming in mice, while inhibiting the  growth of existing tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human trials could begin within a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful, it would be the first vaccine to prevent breast  cancer, reports &lt;strong&gt;CBS&lt;/strong&gt; Cleveland affiliate &lt;strong&gt;WOIO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_01/jackMS0812_468x602.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/12_01/jackMS0812_468x602.jpg" alt="" width="171" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-500611/500-000-boy-left-fighting-life-used-MMR-guinea-pig.html"&gt;The vaccine denial movement claims another victim&lt;/a&gt; – Andrew Wakefield’s former employer, the Royal Free Hospital in North London, has been ordered to pay £500,000 in damages because they carried out an operation that was ‘not clinically justified’ on a 5-year-old child named Jack Piper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High Court papers alleged that the colonoscopy procedure performed on Jack in 1998 was ‘not clinically indicated or justified’. They also claimed the ‘principal reason’ for the surgery was to further research into links between autism and bowel conditions rather than Jack’s clinical needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents also claimed that Jack’s parents were not warned of the risks of the procedure or the ‘controversial and uncertain’ link between autism and bowel conditions. This meant the surgery was performed ‘without lawful consent’ and was an ‘assault’ on Jack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the irony. If I had a dollar for every time a vaccine denier insisted that doctors irresponsibly used children as guinea pigs by giving them untested vaccines and that parents were not properly warned of the risks I’d be a rich man. And yet I don’t expect to hear any vaccine deniers to address the Jack Piper incident at all unless to make excuses such as claiming this is just a hoax created by “Big Pharma” to make discredit their movement. It’s funny though how they’re doing fighting for “the children” only when those children are allegedly harmed by vaccines but show no concern whatsoever for any child directly harmed by their position.&lt;/p&gt;

If you haven't read the review, go do so. It's an absolutely awful book. It's the worst thing I've read since &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2008/02/book-review-who-will-rise-up.html"&gt;Brother Jed's book&lt;/a&gt;. Then read FINIFID's response. Normally, I'd respond in the comments there, but since the response is so long, I can't without chopping it up, so I'll just post it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;FINIFID: Let me again respond, point-by-point, to your reply -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First off, let me apologize for getting the title wrong. As I've pointed out elsewhere on this blog (which I don't expect you to know), I'm dyslexic. A consequence of this is that I often replace words with others as I put things together in my mind. This was the case here. It's not an excuse, but simply an admission of error and that I will henceforth remedy it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You're absolutely correct that the apparent time I published the blog post would imply I read almost the entire book (and also wrote my reply) in a matter of hours. As you expect, this would be impossible. And given the rather detailed review I gave, it should be common sense that something is wrong with that implication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer is that I started &lt;i&gt;writing&lt;/i&gt; the post a few hours after sending Mark the reply. Blogger works in an odd format that it will retroactively arrange and date posts based on the time they were &lt;i&gt;began&lt;/i&gt;. Not when they were actually published to the website. The actual post went up late Monday night/Tuesday morning, a few minutes after which I sent Mark an Email telling him so. The Email was sent @ Tue, May 25, 2010 at 2:00 AM .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, there was actually nearly six days for me to read and write. Thus, using this as a basis to claim I did not read your book is unfounded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your target audience was truly theists, you've done a horrible job at targeting the correct audience. The amount of your book dedicated to engaging them is minimal. Yet you market this as an atheist book. I'm not even sure &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; know who your target audience is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, studying is about repetition. However, right or wrong, things are ingrained into memory if they are repeated. As my piano teacher used to tell me, “Practice doesn't make perfect; It makes permanent.” If your ideas weren't correct, there's no use in “studying” them any further. I could see they're flagrantly wrong from a first pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like it or not, dividing people into your two groups is arbitrary. Sure you can draw &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; line, but wealth isn't as split as you'd like to pretend. It's a continuous progression. Thus, where you place your line is meaningless. Sure, it can be useful to have a way to talk about things (we draw lines in science all the time, between species, between planet/asteroid), but getting hung up on where you draw the line as you do is what makes it meaningless. As I said elsewhere in my review, getting caught up in the analogy and losing sight of reality is a logical flaw I see all the time with Creationists. It's a mistake you're committing as well, hence the reason I called it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, your argument against the Big Bang is still flawed. Although you claim to know a lot more than you let on in your book (which I highly doubt since further knowledge would reveal the holes I've pointed out) &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2006/07/big-bang-common-misconceptions.html"&gt;you &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; manage to get what the Big Bang says wrong&lt;/a&gt;. This now makes your argument into a straw man (yet another logical fallacy!). On top of that, you've now compounded your original logical fallacy and added an argumentum ad infinitum. Let me explain since you apparently have problems with “big words”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you point out, there are numerous hypothetical alternatives to the Big Bang. Steady state and plasma cosmology (which has been repeatedly debunked at &lt;a href="http://dealingwithcreationisminastronomy.blogspot.com/"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;) are “alternatives” in the sense that they have been proposed, but they are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the sense that all available evidence &lt;i&gt;contradicts&lt;/i&gt; them. Your original argument was that you couldn't understand the evidence. Your new argument is that just because you can propose an alternative (regardless of the actual evidence you've ignored), it is equally valid. To then decide between them, you simply default to the ones you can understand (evidence be damned!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you've failed to realize the actual implications of this line of reasoning: It's possible to come up with an &lt;i&gt;infinite&lt;/i&gt; number of possibilities, all slight variations on themes. Thus, now you're forced to consider all of them as legitimate. Thus, your “logic” falls apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only true way to determine things between such sets is those that have accumulated evidence vs. those that haven't. The Big Bang and evolution with common descent hold all the cards. &lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; other theories do. So your claim that you “have proven that the Universe is infinite” (at least in age) is simply wrong. The entire argument you used was, and still is, a logical fallacy. This makes it useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your argument against my bringing up Quantum Mechanics is profoundly anti-intellectual as well. The entire book is an attempt to present an argument for how our world and our bodies &lt;i&gt;really are&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, it must rely on how things &lt;i&gt;really work&lt;/i&gt;. Unfortunately, reality isn't determined by what “regular people” know or want to know. So bringing that up at all is an attempt at distraction. You can't simply ignore it because your audience might not understand it. If it's important to the hypothesis, it's important. It cannot be left out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, your quote from a textbook does absolutely nothing to argue against my point. My point was that the energy isn't &lt;i&gt;created&lt;/i&gt;. It's already present in the form of chemical bonds which are being broken. You seem to be implying it's magically being created &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; the matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to your bastardization of the term theory, it's yet another of your logical fallacies. In this case, it's the fallacy of equivocation. A “theory” in layman's terms is not the same as a “theory” in scientific terms. The former means a guess. The latter means “overwhelmingly tested and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” Your “theory”, as well as Steady State “theory” and many others your attempt obfuscation with, are the former. The Big Bang and evolution are the latter. Conflating the two to attempt to make the former look equal in importance to the latter is a dirty trick used by Creationists and a personal pet peeve of mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did not “totally miss” chapter 6. It was just pointless to address specifically. It was a grand total of three pages. The first page was a summary of points I'd already addressed and the conclusions were little more than bland restatements from them. Not worth writing about, but if I'd like me to edit that statement into my original review, I'll be more than happy to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In regards to chapter 7, your new claims are not consistent with what you'd said before. Here, you say that supernovae can &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; new star formation. In your book, you claimed that the material given off &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; formed the new stars through “broken off pieces”. These two points are mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have read chapter 8. My statement still stands based on what is given in the book. Your numbers are completely without justification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the way, thanks for not wanting to “give [me] a course in planetary creation and destruction.” I've &lt;a href="http://www.missouristate.edu/registrar/dept_pa.html"&gt;already had one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your response to what I said about life being complex, well, I don't know what to say. You didn't really offer a response beyond maintaining it is simple, without any actual justification and just saying if I knew more, I'd get it. That's not really an argument. It's an excuse not to provide one. I know quite a lot about Biology. Although I haven't had nearly as much formal training in Biology as I have in the physical sciences, I've been debating Evolution/Creationism for eight years and read numerous books on the topic. I've discussed points with many people in the field. In fact, I know it well enough to teach it. Thus, simply responding “learn more” is not really saying anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as chapter 12 goes, you &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; claim that the brain is something life needs to achieve for higher organisms (although you never called it by name). Let me quote you:&lt;blockquote&gt;When complicated and advanced cells began grouping together and created some simple organisms … the need for some central intelligence of that organism had arisen&lt;/blockquote&gt;You then go on to list functions of this “central intelligence” center, most of which are performed by the brain. Thus, without explicitly naming it, you &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; claim the brain is necessary. My point stands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your next rant is on humans and animals being different. I'm not going to bother going through the evidences (you obviously don't care about such things). If you care to find them, I'd suggest looking at talkorigins.org. These issues have already been hammered out in detail with Creationists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your confidence is unbounded population growth is merit less as well. Sure, kids will have sex and make more babies. But will the rate at which they continue to have kids be consistent as you assume? Will there never again be a great plague that destroys large percentages of the population? Will resources allow for as many people to survive? You assume all of these won't happen and that the case for now will continue forever, but even optimistic population models include such things. This is a staggering oversight on your part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not in any way closed minded. As I pointed out in my closing, there's a difference between having an open mind and having one that gets soggy when it rains. I prefer to think of my mind as “guarded.” You need to have some actual evidence to be accepted in as more than a hypothetical scenario. But apparently, you like to allow things in based on generalizations and logical fallacies aimed at the masses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the topic of heredity: Your now claim that your genes “keep you human”. I get the impression you're pretty shaky on the definition of species. How much divergence does there need to be before humans are, well, not human? Until you start using some sort of system by which your distinctions have some meaning, your point can't be taken seriously. Again, this is a tactic Creationists love to hide behind. I have no respect for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the way, I don't believe in astrology. It's not something I've put on my “About-Me” page. It's something that blogger automatically puts there based on my birthday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll agree that chapter 15 is especially important in establishing your hypothesis. It's the grand unveiling. Given how shoddy your base is for the grand conclusion, I've treated it with due respect. As for chapter 1 of part 2 being important, I just reread it (somewhat more carefully this time). I agree with most the points against religion in it, but it isn't necessary for the rest of the thesis. If you really think it's important, then I think you're confusing the side topic (atheism and the lack of god) with the main one (the LAW).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point, your response turns ironic. You claim I summarized in chapter 2 in “two words”. I gave it a whole three &lt;i&gt;sentences&lt;/i&gt; which outlined the main points without bothering to respond to them in any way. Yet, magically, you've decided that this amounts to “insults”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But at this point, you're not bothering to respond to anything I said. Instead, you bitch and moan about me hurling insults, then you have an entire list of your own with a dose of silly psychoanalysis. I absolutely do not “spew [my] accumulated poison”. If you'd read the other reviews I've written, I'm very positive where good things can be said. In contrast, I maintain that the proper response to the ridiculous is ridicule. Given that the second half of your book is based on the first half, and the first half was nothing but logical pit holes, the entire second part is ridiculous. Thus, the second half of my review was more geared towards ridicule, but I'm in no way apologetic for such things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I take great care to keep your sentences in context. If you care to argue how one is out of context, feel free to actually address it (which you've notably not done through all of your response thus far) instead of simply claiming it. Let's see some academic integrity here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author/publisher is rather unimportant to the main topic, but I never pretended it was. Notice I left It distinctly as an afterthought, separate from the main review. As far as “trying to dig in the dirty clothes”, you mentioning that shows your hypocrisy given you find it important to dig through my profile on a separate page to complain about the astrological notes that are affixed there without my asking. But hypocrisy is apparently rife with you in closing given you continue spewing poison of your own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, I do understand your book. The overall thought process is shaky, but stable, assuming the foundational statements are accurate. Those foundational statements include (but are not limited to) the infinite age of the universe, the creation of new celestial bodies, and the distinctness of the human species from animals. Given that all of these topics (and the ones I originally brought up and you unsuccessfully defended) you display woeful incompetence on and still have yet to support, your entire foundation crumbles, taking the rest of the structure with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given this fact, there's no point in reading it again. I didn't expect you to be happy in hearing this, but your response has only confirmed what I already suspected: You're not really interested in academic, intellectual, or honest reviews. You want shallow praise from people that don't have enough knowledge to actually subject your claims to any real scrutiny. I cannot respect that. Your insistence that I should, and I should politely overlook the glaring holes in your basic knowledge is asinine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So thank you for your lack of respect. I have no need of it from you. I'd much rather have it from people whose worldviews are built on logic, rational thinking, and evidence.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8695586685169868293?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275367081417"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/dr_isis_versus_the_bratwurst.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6ecbfbc486ce0da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Dr. Isis versus the Bratwurst</title><published>2010-06-01T04:44:41Z</published><updated>2010-06-01T04:44:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/Qo42XCKOBoY/dr_isis_versus_the_bratwurst.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/dr_isis_versus_the_bratwurst.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today began delightfully with Little Isis deciding that he is Batman.  Last night we watched some Batman cartoons and then this morning he put on his rain boots and a monkey blanket over his head...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/Isis%20is%20Batman1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Isis is Batman1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/Isis%20is%20Batman1-thumb-300x400-50215.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="300" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: I am not exactly sure why Batman needed dragon rain boots, but who am I to argue?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and began leaping off of anything he could find, trying to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/Isis%20is%20Batrman2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Isis is Batrman2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/Isis%20is%20Batrman2-thumb-300x400-50217.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="300" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: I tried to explain to him that Batman doesn&amp;#39;t really &amp;quot;fly&amp;quot;.   He mostly just falls with style.  Little Isis, however, was not ready to hear this.  Thankfully, I was able to prevent him from jumping off of any items taller than him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is Memorial Day and this week some of the people at work have been on a mission.  You see, they recently learned one of the deepest darkest secrets of everyone's favorite domestic and laboratory diva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never eaten a bratwurst.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I still am not sure &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratwurst"&gt;what makes a bratwurst different from any other kind of sausage&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#39;ve still never eaten one.  Apparently, in this part of the United States, this is some kind of mortal sin.  And so, this week I have been investigated and interrogated for the story of how I might have grown into an adult woman with at least 30 years behind her, without ever haven eaten a bratwurst.  I&amp;#39;ve heard things like, &amp;quot;You really can&amp;#39;t have Memorial Day if you don&amp;#39;t have bratwurst. It&amp;#39;s unamerican!&amp;quot; Some people have reacted with shock and surprise to hear this groundbreaking piece of news.  A few asked what I have typically eaten on Memorial Day and I shared that for the Memorial Days I remember - especially when I was in middle school, high school and college and was with my family - we ate foods like carne asada, rice, and empanadas.  I still really like carne asada on Memorial Day.  On several occasions some of the folks I work with looked at me, puzzled, and asked, &amp;quot;You eat carne asada on Memorial Day?&amp;quot; Thus began the quest to get me to eat my first bratwurst this Memorial Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have shared the fascination the people at work seem to have with my brat-free life with my good friend Hathor.  Last night I knew that something had to be done, so I sent her a text message.  If you&amp;#39;ve been following &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/shithathorsays"&gt;her Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, you may have deduced that Hathor is a Native American woman.  That&amp;#39;s important in order to understand the conversation that ensued:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Do you want to have a BBQ tomorrow? Celebrate like white folk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hathor:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Oh dear. I guess we ought to. You know, for appearances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Seriously. People will think we're not Americans [if I don't eat a bratwurst.] They might deport us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hathor:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Deport me WHERE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Do you think they'll care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that in that conversation I took my debacle and turned it into "our" problem? I am a pro at this and I am convinced that this is how Hathor and I get into at least half the trouble we find ourselves in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when I went to the market today to stock up for BBQ-type food, I bought these:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/bratwurst.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="bratwurst.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/bratwurst-thumb-300x400-50222.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="300" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: I thought these were bratwursts when I bought them.  Mr. Isis has since informed me that they are called &amp;quot;cheddarwursts.&amp;quot;  Isis FAIL.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I just couldn&amp;#39;t eat them.  I cooked hamburgers and bratwursts for the folks here and I ate a piece of &lt;a href="http://www.tienda.com/food/chorizo.html"&gt;chorizo&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the day I didn&amp;#39;t want to eat bratwurst because &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s Memorial Day and it&amp;#39;s American&amp;quot; and, for as much fun as Hathor and I had laughing at my white coworker&amp;#39;s obsession with getting me to eat bratwurst, it was bittersweet laughter.  You see, this Memorial Day not fitting in with the dominant white culture has potentially devastating consequences for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Governor Jan Brewer of Arizona &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html"&gt;signed a bill into law&lt;/a&gt; that "would make the failure to carry immigration documents a crime and give the 
police broad power to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;quot;  This law, an unchecked open door to racial profiling, terrifies me.  Over the last month it has frequently given me pause to realize how often I don&amp;#39;t carry my identification.  I forget it in my desk at work or leave it in my car.  While I will probably never be suspected of being here illegally, I worry for people like my abeulos, who still speak with strong accents, my darker skinned younger sister, and my godson. I worry that this law will become a mechanism to detain Latinos when police have no other cause. I also worry that other states will jump into Arizona&amp;#39;s deep, dark pool of crazy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I especially wonder about the ways my Latino hermanos will try to conform in order not to raise suspicions.  Not playing their music.  Not speaking Spanish in public.  Changing how they dress.  Eating bratwurst instead of carne asada. An entire population of people trying to just pass enough to not get detained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How white does one have to act to not get detained by the police? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this country and I think that its diversity is part of what makes it great.  I am thankful for those who have given their lives so that my family could work and raise a family here.  But I am also afraid.  I am afraid that we are going somewhere that we are not going to be able to come back from and I am especially worried that &lt;a href="http://www.asianamericanmedia.org/jainternment/"&gt;the past is going to repeat itself with devastating consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/cNPCx0NDxFI%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Great.  What was that line....?  &lt;i&gt;"Who watches the Watchmen?"&lt;/i&gt;  Yeah, that's it.  Someone needs to investigate the Pope and get his ass up on some charges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any event, one of the dudes heading up the Ireland charade is New York Archbiship Timothy Dolan.  He is apparently hard on pedophiles, but check out &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dolan#Gay_marriage"&gt;what he said about gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an in-built code of right and wrong that is imbedded in the human DNA...Hard-wired into us is a dictionary, and the dictionary defines marriage as between one man, one woman for life, please God, leading to the procreation of human life. And if we begin to tamper with the very definition of marriage, then we're going to be in big trouble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It always kills me when priests start talking about DNA.  Please, Mr. Dolan, don't try to be scientific.  Stick to philosophy where your "arguments" just might be a tad more persuasive.  Unlikely, but at least there's a chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question: Is an infertile hetero couple a slap to god's face too?  Should the husband of an infertile woman just dump the barren chick and find a babe with nice birthin' hips?  Should the wife of a man who's shootin' blanks just ditch him and his empty gun and search the bars and internets for a stud?  Come on, Dolan, pipe up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dolan.  Hey, hey we're the Monkees...and people say we Monkee around!  Oh, wait, they didn't come from no monkey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back on track.  Dolan is also &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dolan#Clerical_celibacy"&gt;quoted as saying&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;The recent sad scandal of clerical sexual abuse of minors, as the professionals have documented, has nothing to do with our celibate commitment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Is this really one of they guys you want doing any sort of investigation?  He seems like he can barely think, let alone break from the Vatican on any issue.  Seriously, as IF the pope is going to prosecute anyone.  He could find a priest ass-raping a 12 year old at the alter of St. Peter's Square and there would be a cover-up.  I'd bang my head against the wall but that would only hurt me when it's the Church that I want to disappear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I find a way to do that I'll keep you posted....&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

One of the main obstacles keeping more farmers from participating in carbon markets is the difficulty of accurately measuring the carbon that is sequestered in their fields.In addition to the costs of field-scale monitoring, much of this difficulty can be traced to limited knowledge of how complex soil processes translate into the ecosystem service of interest: how much carbon is sequestered.A new paper in Ecological Economics seeks in part to address this by developing a new and improved framework for quantifying carbon sequestration and other soil ecosystem services. Almost from the beginning, starting with Daily (1997), scientists knew that “research is needed to better characterize the ecosystem services supplied by soils” (quote from Daily 1997).Despite a good understanding of soil formation and functioning, “our ability to understand soil natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides is incomplete.”One reason this study is needed is confusion over existing frameworks for soil ecosystem services in the literature. For example, a prior paper lists ‘retention and delivery of nutrients to plants’ as a service, when in truth they are merely processes.In addition, the authors argue, existing frameworks may only “a one-to-one correspondence between processes and services without acknowledging the complexity of soil processes… limiting each service to one [process and] indicator fails to recognize that each soil service is the product of multiple properties and processes.”To address these shortcomings, the authors present a broader and more holistic framework for classifying, quantifying and modeling soil natural capital and ecosystem services. [For a better image, see page 6 of paper.] The framework includes the following interconnected components:1. Soil as natural capital2. Natural capital formation, maintenance and degradation3. Drivers of soil processes4. Provisioning, regulating and cultural soil ecosystem services5. Human needs fulfilled by soil ecosystem servicesDominati, E., Patterson, M., &amp;amp; Mackay, A. (2010).

&lt;p&gt;For example, how many of those partisan emails or “news” outlets mention that Obama did indeed visit Arlington National Cemetery in 2009?  Here’s a photo of him at the event…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/barack-obama-memorial-day-2009.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Barack-Obama-Memorial-Day-2009" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/barack-obama-memorial-day-2009.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=333" alt="" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but a quick search of &lt;a href="http://snopes.com"&gt;Snopes.com&lt;/a&gt; – an excellent website for checking the validity of all manner of Internet nonsense – &lt;a href="http://snopes.com/politics/obama/memorialday.asp"&gt;reveals plenty more information which the partisans who forward this garbage are omitting…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claim:&lt;/strong&gt; Mike Savage [a right-wing shock jock] stated that President Obama was not going to Arlington this Memorial Day but is sending VP Biden in his place. Obama is going to Chicago instead. Savage stated that this is the first time in history that a President has not laid a wreath at Arlington on Memorial day. Is this true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true.  Specifically, the claim that Obama is the first U.S. president to not lay a wreath at Arlington on Memorial Day is not true.  Snopes.com elaborates…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Origins:&lt;/strong&gt; Memorial Day, now observed on the last Monday of May, is the day of the year set aside for Americans to commemorate the men and women of the United States who died while in the military service.  On Memorial Day the President of the United States traditionally visits Arlington National Cemetery, where America’s honored dead are interred, to deliver a speech in remembrance of those who died in service to their country and to lay a memorial wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News that President Obama would be spending the 2010 Memorial Day weekend in Chicago rather than attending services in Arlington were attended by claims (like the example cited above) that he would thus become the first U.S. president to skip the Arlington wreath-laying ceremony since the inception of Memorial Day.  This claim is inaccurate: On several occasions in just the last thirty years, U.S. presidents have been elsewhere on Memorial Day (either vacationing or attending to other presidential duties), while other administration officials represented them at the wreath-laying ceremony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; In 2002, President George W. Bush was in France on Memorial Day and participated in ceremonies at Normandy (site of the D-Day landings) honoring the U.S. soldiers who fought and died in World War II.  In his place, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; President George H.W. Bush (himself a World War II veteran) attended no ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery during his four years in office.  In 1989 he was in Rome on Memorial Day (where he led observances at an American military cemetery south of that city), and from 1990 through 1992 he spent the Memorial Day weekend vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, while Vice-President Dan Quayle laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; President Ronald Reagan was away from Arlington on Memorial Day on four occasions during his eight years in office: In 1981, he (who had been seriously wounded in an assassination attempt six weeks earlier) spent the Memorial Day weekend at his ranch in Santa Barbara, California, while Vice-President George H.W. Bush laid the wreath at Arlington.  In 1983, he attended a summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia, while Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Thayer represented the administration at the wreath-laying ceremony.  In 1987, he spent Memorial Day at the Camp David presidential retreat while Navy Secretary James Webb participated in the wreath-laying ceremony.   And on Memorial Day 1988, he was out of the U.S., attending a summit meeting in Moscow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; (NOTE: President Bill Clinton has no entry in this list because he attended Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington each year throughout his eight years in office.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Memorial Day 2010, President Obama is scheduled to honor America’s fallen heroes with a speech at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery near Chicago, while Vice-President Joe Biden takes his place at Arlington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sort of sucks the wind out of the “Obama hates America!” sails, doesn’t it?  And, lest the reader think this nonsense isn’t being encouraged and propagated by the right-wing partisans, just take a look at this (in my opinion, quite reprehensible) &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjTSz8KLq_I"&gt;Youtube video by right-wing shock jock Michael Savage…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/memorial-day-president-obama-and-internet-nonsense/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/NjTSz8KLq_I/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing here is that it is so easy for morons like Mike Savage to spread such nonsense &amp;amp; idiocy among the U.S. population.  Of course, part of this is because too many people do not think critically about where they get their “news”.  Should I seriously have to tell anyone reading this post that outlets such as Glenn Beck &amp;amp; Rush Limbaugh on the right and Keith Olbermann on the left should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be considered “news”?  Apparently so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that, despite having seen this sort of thing again and again, many people are all too willing to take whatever they receive in their email inboxes as true so long as it confirms their preconceived biases – this is called &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Confirmation_Bias"&gt;confirmation bias.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;You want to think that President Obama is the anti-Christ?  Yup, he sure is, because this email says so!&lt;/em&gt; [/sarcasm off]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the media share some of the blame as well.  We live in a time where the media are slaves to the 24-hour news cycle, and sensationalism often takes a back seat to reasoned &amp;amp; careful discourse.  Too many in the media are just interested in gathering ratings by appealing to shock value and crazy-sounding headlines, and this colors the discourse of many things, especially politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, just in case you think this is only a problem on the conservative end of the political spectrum, think again folks.  Snopes.com has plenty of examples of those on the left who engage in the same kind of nonsense – check &lt;a href="http://snopes.com/politics/bush/bush.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://snopes.com/politics/palin/palin.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to take a calmer, more rational look at all things political.  And when we see something on the “news”, we need to think carefully about how the information we are receiving is being delivered to us.&lt;/p&gt;

My grandmother was from a small town in what is now Belarus and most people in the family were born, lived, and died there.  One of her brothers, though, did something remarkable.  If family memories are correct, he left town and went to the Sorbonne in Paris.  After being there a short while, the Great War broke out, and he joined the French army to fight for his new home.  He was killed, and my father and two of his cousins are named for him (in an Anglicized way). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in the first generation of men in my family to have been able to choose not to go to war.  My father was in Korea as a doctor.  His father joined the army shortly after immigrating to U.S., but the Great War ended shortly thereafter.  My one American-born grandfather tried to join the army for World War I but was too skinny, so he went home and gorged on bananas until he was heavy enough to get in the army.  He used to sing me WW I drinking songs when I was a kid.  He was very patriotic, and tried to join up again for WW II but was rejected for being too old.  He's lucky he was, or my grandmother might have killed him herself.  She seemed to understand something my very patriotic grandfather did not---war is dangerous.  Even those who survive are often wounded in ways that is not easy to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a medical resident I had my own patients at the V.A. hospital.  I had vets from WW II, Korea, Viet Nam, and all the times in between.  Many of the Viet Nam vets would come to me with the same story: they had headaches, or nightmares, or depression, and had never really talked about it.  I would ask them frankly if they thought they had PTSD, and usually they would say they did.  Some did very well, some did not.  I would always ask them what the did in the war, expecting "infantry" or "marines" etc, but more often than not the answer I got was, "some really bad shit, Doc."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around that same time I used to stop at a watchmaker's shop down the street from my apartment.  The watchmaker was a veteran of the war in the Pacific, where he was a Marine officer.  He was wounded several times, spoke of the war often, and had scrapbooks about the war and his buddies.  But what he would mention most often was the men he'd killed.  He didn't regret it as such, but the memories of killing seemed to haunt him.  He would tell me over and over how they'd had to kill or be killed, how they'd had to kill to win the war, to keep their country safe.  It was all true.  I'm not sure how much it mattered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we try to absorb back into society the veterans our latest wars have created, we are facing new and old challenges.  Many have the same invisible wounds, but many have additional problems.  Traumatic brain injuries and amputations have been very common in the last fifteen years or so due largely to IEDs.  And soldiers, sailors, and marines are serving multiple tours year after year, increasing the risk of PTSD and other injuries.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we cannot forget those who have fallen, we must not forget those who have gotten up again, but slowly.  Many of them will fall again and again during their civilian lives and we must be prepared to pick them up.  It is the very least we can do.  The bare minimum, actually.&lt;br&gt;

It wasn&amp;#39;t always like that, of course, but one of the problems with trying to work out how the present state of affairs came about is that there are very few statistics on religion the stretch back far enough.

Stepping into the breach is Steven Bruce and Tony Glendinning, of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. They&amp;#39;ve put together a time-series from data collected by the Methodists Churches, who have been among the most rigorous in collecting data on their membership.

If you look at the raw numbers, it looks at first sight as though Methodist membership help up quite well - at least until recent decades. But over that same period of time, the total population of the UK nearly trebled.

When you plot membership as a percentage of the total population, a different picture emerges. Methodist membership has actually been declining since records began, with the decline accelerating in the post-war period decades.

Broadly similar patterns (with a few hiccups) can be seen in many other measures of religion in the UK (although inevitably more murky because the data or more patchy). Overall church membership peaked around 1904, Sunday School enrolment peaked in the same decade, and baptisms peaked around 1930.

What caused this decline? Well, membership goes down when the churches lose members - either to death or defection - faster than they can recruit. And the evidence suggests that the major reason for the decline is failure to bind children into the religion of their parents.

This really kicked off during the Second World War. Here&amp;#39;s another graph, showing some data for Scotland. There was a sudden surge in the numbers of people who stopped attending, which started during the war and persisted after it. This was mostly due to people who went to church as children, but who stopped attending before they turned 21.

The Second World War caused an enormous upheaval in European society, and trying to trace any one factor as the cause of the rise in godlessness is problematic. However, one clue is that a major reason for young adults to abandon Christianity is having parents from different denominations.

In other words, its much more difficult to pass on religion to your children if parents have different views - even if those differences are as minor as the differences between Anglicans and Methodists.

Now, add to this the fact that the War brought a revolution in the social mobility of women. Young women broke free from their traditional roles, and by 1943 90% of single women aged 18-40 were employed either in the armed forces or in industry.

Many women found themselves posted to areas of the country far from home, often with others - both men and women - of very different social backgrounds. And with that came not only a broadened outlook but also sexual emancipation. On &amp;#39;Land Girl&amp;#39; working in Romney Marsh recalled:

There were troops everywhere. You could just take your pick. You didn’t know how many were married; you just had to take their word for it. . . . I had several boyfriends during the war. . . . It was a case of a broken heart one night and the next night a new boyfriend’

One result of this freedom was that women born between 1914-1924 were twice as likely to have had sex before marriage than women born 10 years before. But, perhaps more importantly, both men and women were exposed to perspectives on the world that they would never have gained previously.

According to Bruce &amp;amp; Glendinning, the war war weakened the community ties that help the successful transmission of any shared cultural characteristic:

With vast numbers of young men in the armed forces being moved around the country, one way or another, almost all single British women between 1939 and 1945 experienced an unprecedented degree of social mixing. A large part of the eligible population had a chance to engage in pleasant and positive social interaction with people from very different social, regional, cultural and religious backgrounds (Harris 2000: 113). Not all such mixing resulted in a broadening of horizons and a weakening of previous loyalties. The aliens – inner-city evacuees, servicemen, foreigners – could be handy scapegoats for those who saw no benefit from the disruption of old ways of life but for many of those whose children were to form the missing generation of church members in the 1960s, the war was a liberating experience.

As a result, women were less likely to marry the local lad from the same street and church. And it&amp;#39;s the mixing together of different world views and perspectives that is fatal for the successful transmission of religion.

There are a few different ways to change the way a structure is put together. Research on the development of limbs has tended to view morphological changes as being caused by changing boundaries that delineate different regions of the embryo. If you want a bigger forebrain, shift the boundary between the forebrain and the midbrain backward.

Neurobiologists, however, have sometimes suggested that brains differ due to the amount and duration of neurogenesis that goes on during development. If you want a bigger forebrain, make neurons for a longer time in the forebrain than in the midbrain.

A new paper by Sylvester and colleagues tries to look at the relative importance of these two developmental mechanisms in brain evolution. To do this, they looked at the brains of cichlid fishes. Cichlids are renowned among evolutionary biologists for their diversity and the speed at which it was achieved, and this diversity extends to their brain morphology. They chose six species to study; Cynotilapia afra and Copadichromis borleyi are shown here (click to enlarge). The former is a mbuna, a rock-dwelling fish, and the latter is a sand-dweller; the authors had three species of each.

The brains of the mbuna and non-mbuna differ in their proportions: the mbuna have smaller forebrains (strictly speaking, purists would say the telencephalon) than the non-mbuna.

Sylvester and colleagues visualized the cichlid brains using several that are well-known to be involved in development, like sonic hedgehog (shh), and Wnt and found that the pattern of expression of these did indeed differ in these species, typically following the mbuna / non-mbuna split. 

To test whether these genes caused the differences in brain sizes, the authors exposed embryos of the mbuna species Labeotropheus fuelleborni (right) to lithium chloride, which affects the Wnt pathway. When they did this, they found that the L. fuelleborni brains were looking rather more like non-mbuna brains, which proportionately larger telencephalons.

Sylvester and company argue that this suggests the very early expression of genes that lay out patterns in the nervous system are key regulators of brain evolution. Considering that they sort of set up timing of neurogenesis as an alternate hypothesis in their introduction, however, it’s worth pointing out that they didn’t actually measure neurogenesis or try to manipulate it in a manner similar to what they did for these patterning genes and proteins. It’s possible that neurogenesis is playing a role in shaping diversity of brains in other ways than tested here.

I'm pretty impressed with it. Here are a few snippets to whet your appetites:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maybe God isn’t dead. Maybe he’s just going deaf. Maybe he’s totally deaf in one ear, and partially deaf in the other. It’s understandable. He is getting to be a little ancient of days anymore. Eventually, everyone’s hearing starts to go. We’re made in God’s image after all, so I don’t know why we would expect it to be any different for the archetype.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, what does it mean to say that God is going to redeem this situation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what sense, then, does a mass of Christians and non-Christians all giving aid to a group of people who are suffering bring glory to God? Even if God is orchestrating the entire relief effort, how does God bandaging up the wounds of the Haitians who survived exculpate God from complicity in their suffering and the death of one hundred thousand in the first place? Can you imagine such a defense offered by a mass murderer? “Yes, I shot 44 people in one hour and 32 of them died, but I drove the surviving 12 to the hospital. I don’t understand why I’m on trial here. You should be thanking me.” If God really created this earth, then God is responsible for the natural processes of this earth. If God made it, why did he make it this way, so that every once in a while, the earth opens up and swallows a hundred thousand people in death? Or are you going to tell me that prior to “the fall” there were no earthquakes? Earthquakes and tsunamis only happen because Eve ate a bite of a quince 6,000 years ago. After she bit into it, the composition of the earth was fundamentally altered on a real physical level so that now the earth itself has a bloodlust. That’s supposed to be an answer? We’re supposed to believe that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or maybe you’ll say that without suffering, nobody could be good. Goodness requires suffering in order to be shaped and proved. If that’s the case, then how was God good before evil came along? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wait, you say. These people weren’t innocent! No one is innocent! “All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.” (There’s God’s glory again.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right. Forgive me. I forgot about that one. Any sin requires death, so really, we shouldn’t say God is cruel for killing these people. We should say that he is merciful for not killing them until now! All those thousands of faceless toddlers who are buried in mass graves of unidentified bodies—they deserved to die, because they once said “No” to their parents when it was time to go to bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you resort to the old cliché: “God is mysterious. The answers aren’t clear now, but they will become clear.” Indeed, you’re partly right. How we can affirm both that God created this world, and that God is good—that is a mystery. Whether it’s a profound mystery, or a convenient one, I’ll leave you to decide. But the moment we start defining “love” and “justice” and “goodness” as “whatever God does/commands,” that’s the moment those terms cease to have any usefulness for human beings. Either God is good and good is therefore unintelligible, or good is good and God is therefore unintelligible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless, who do you think you are, you armchair theologians, you professional apologists! Did God’s victims appoint you? Did they grant you the power to acquit the Most High? What gives you the right? Your Bible College degree? Your ordination? Your PhD? Your church attendance record? Your own personal experiences? Which of these gives you the right to issue an immediate “not guilty” verdict upon God, on behalf of nine new orphans? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://thomstark.net/?p=834"&gt;Thom offers no answers&lt;/a&gt;. At least he's being honest. Kudos to him. Read his entire essay and check around his blog a bit. There is much for thought.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7501121692585792914?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

They are creating &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vatican-reaches-out-to-atheists-ndash-but-not-you-richard-dawkins-1987518.html"&gt;a foundation called "The Courtyard of Gentiles" to encourage discussion between Catholics and the godly&lt;/a&gt; — I can hardly wait. Except, alas, it turns out their invitations are only going to a select few.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in an interview with the National Catholic Register, Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi, the president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, made it clear he would not be willing to give a platform to certain prominent atheists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The foundation, he said, would only be interested in "noble atheism or agnosticism, not the polemical kind - so not those atheists such as [Piergiorgio] Odifreddi in Italy, [Michel] Onfray in France, [Christopher] Hitchens and [Richard] Dawkins".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Such atheists, he added, only view the truth with "irony and sarcasm" and tend to "read religious texts like fundamentalists".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has got to be a cabal of atheists working within the church — I can&amp;#39;t imagine them being this incompetent by accident. So apparently they only want &lt;i&gt;faitheists&lt;/i&gt; in their little clubhouse, because as we all know, the primary weapon of the atheists is irony and sarcasm…the &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; weapons of the atheists are irony, sarcasm, and ridicule…wait. Man, we are so danged vicious. We actually &lt;i&gt;mock&lt;/i&gt; Catholics, so we're just too mean to come to their party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except me, right? They didn&amp;#39;t mention that little guy in Minnesota as being on their blacklist, so there&amp;#39;s still hope…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/im_waiting_by_my_mailbox.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0HY1f78UK9Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275343254290"><id gr:original-id="http://replicatedtypo.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/cultural-innovation-pleistocene-environments-and-demographic-change/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbe3d8b183e2326c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Cultural innovation, Pleistocene environments and demographic change</title><published>2010-05-31T17:50:33Z</published><updated>2010-05-31T17:50:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/-RU0xtkWV7I/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://replicatedtypo.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/cultural-innovation-pleistocene-environments-and-demographic-change/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">It is well documented that Thomas Robert Malthus’ An Essay on the Principle of Population greatly influenced both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace’s independent conception of their theory of natural selection.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Jindal] is singing a new song, starkly at odds with what he said last year in a speech before the Republican faithful. Now he’s begging for federal “interference.” He wants federal money, federal supplies, wants the feds to help create barrier islands to protect Louisiana wetlands from oil.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you &lt;a href="http://www.kansas.com/2010/05/31/1337729/leonard-pitts-free-market-religion.html"&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt;, one part stands out for obvious reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;As there are no atheists in foxholes, it turns out there are no small-government disciples in massive oil spills.&lt;/strong&gt; No, with BP oil soaking the sands of his coastline, Jindal turned righteously to that big, sometimes bloated, often intrusive federal government, and asked for help. He said: Send money, send resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice he never once said: Send less.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are many &lt;a href="http://www.maaf.info/expaif.html"&gt;atheists in foxholes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look no further than the &lt;a href="http://www.maaf.info/"&gt;Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers&lt;/a&gt; for evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t sound like Pitts was purposely being anti-atheist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, he was just ignorant about this issue and fell into a harmful cliché.  It’s especially relevant considering it’s Memorial Day and atheists (like people of faith) have died in service for our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s educate him.  &lt;a href="mailto:lpitts@miamiherald.com"&gt;Send him an email&lt;/a&gt; letting him know there are indeed atheists who serve our country honorably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep it polite and rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally want to see an apology from him, at the very least.  A column about patriotic atheists would be nice, too… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives#Demographics"&gt;wouldn’t want&lt;/a&gt; to live there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to the revised constitution, in article two, it says that the republic “is based on the principles of Islam.” Article nine says that “a non-Muslim may not become a citizen of the Maldives”; number ten says that “no law contrary to any principle of Islam can be applied in the Maldives.” Article nineteen states that “citizens are free to participate in or carry out any activity that is not expressly prohibited by sharia or by the law.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mohamed Nazim&lt;/strong&gt; does live there, though, and he has &lt;a href="http://minivannews.com/politics/islamic-foundation-calls-for-death-sentence-if-apostate-fails-to-repent-7606"&gt;openly declared he is not a Muslim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nazim claimed he was “Maldivian and not a Muslim” during a public question-and-answer session with Islamic speaker Dr Zakir Naik, the first time a Maldivian has publicly announced he is not a Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 37 year-old angered many in the approximately 11,000-strong crowd with his statement during Dr Naik’s ‘Misconceptions about Islam’ lecture on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Naik responded that Nazim had read the wrong books and “deviated from Islam”, and requested him “to read correct books on Islam, and Inshallah, you’ll come back to Islam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However Nazim did not relinquish the microphone and pressed Naik to clarify the penalty for apostasy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalty is death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, they’ll give him a chance to repent… but he won’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because of that, he’s probably going to be killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Today the Islamic Foundation of the Maldives issued a press statement calling on judges to give Nazim the opportunity to repent “and if he does not, then sentence him to death as Islamic law and Maldivian law agree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Islamic Foundation believes that the person who announces apostasy should be punished according to Islamic laws,” the NGO said, warning that Nazim represented “a disturbance to the religious views and the religious bonds that exist with Maldivians.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could any of those moderate Muslims who were so vocal against the stick figure drawings of Muhammad please remind me again why Islam deserves our respect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about it being a “religion of peace”…?&lt;/p&gt;

Darwin saw our minds, like our bodies, as resulting from the accumulation of adaptive differences through natural selection.  Wallace, on the other hand, thought that our higher mental powers represented nonadaptive evolutionary overkill—faculties that were simply not adaptively &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to become human.  Wallace saw these as arising instead from the intercession of “a superior intelligence”, and so was the first post-Darwinian exponent of intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Wallace’s question remains a good one, and is posed anew by Steven Pinker in a nice paper&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/05/04/0914630107.abstract"&gt; in a recent online issue of &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . why do humans have the ability to pursue abstract intellectual feats such as science, mathematics, philosophy, and law, given that opportunities to exercise these talents did not exist in the foraging lifestyle in which humans evolved and would not have parlayed themselves into advantages in survival and reproduction even if they did?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinker proposes an answer—that these feats are &lt;em&gt;byproducts&lt;/em&gt; of selection for early humans to inhabit a “cognitive niche.” This answer may well be right, but at the very least will make you think. (You can find more discussion of the cognitive niche idea in chapter 3 of Pinker’s &lt;em&gt;How  the Mind Works &lt;/em&gt;and chapters 5 and 9 of &lt;em&gt;The Stuff of Thought&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pinker sees as the “cognitive niche” (a term invented by John Tooby and Irv DeVore) is a lifestyle of using both thought and social cooperation to manipulate the environment.  This involves, for example, using tools, extracting poisons from plants,  and all the stratagems of cooperative hunting: planning, communicating, making traps, and so forth.  Pinker sees several “preadaptations” that facilitated our entry into this niche (by “predadaptation,” I mean features that evolved for one purpose but  could subsequently be coopted for a different one).  One is our prehensile hands, perhaps themselves a byproduct of bipedality. Another is our opportunistic diet, which included meat: as Pinker notes, meat is “not only a concentrated source of nutrients for a hungry brain but may have selected in turn for greater intelligence, because it requires more cleverness to outwit an animal than to outwit fruits or leaves.” A third is group living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big advantage of manipulating the environment, and passing that knowledge on to others, is that we can meet environmental challenges quickly, while other animals meet them by the much slower process of genetic evolution.  Our mentality, in other words, gives us a huge leg up in the human-environment arms race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, the cognitive niche will get filled as sociality, mentality, and dexterity all evolve and coevolve, facilitating each other’s evolution.  Language, for instance, will evolve to facilitate group living and cooperation, but that language will itself permit the evolution of more complicated behaviors involving altruism, reciprocity, and calculation of others’ motives.  Coevolving with this would have been longer periods of childhood to enable us to learn everything we need to fit into the cognitive niche, and then longer lives to take advantage of that learning.  Pinker notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for these hypotheses comes from the data of Kaplan (36), who has shown that among hunter-gatherers, prolonged childhood cannot pay off without long life spans. The men do not produce as many calories as they consume until age 18; their output then peaks at 32, plateaus through 45, then gently declines until 65. This shows that hunting is a knowledge dependent skill, invested in during a long childhood and paid out over a long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course prolonged child-rearing itself selects for many other adaptations. These may have included hidden ovulation (to keep males faithful), biparental care, and so on. According to Pinker, the evolution of human mentality involved a nexus of interconnected and mutually reinforcing selection pressures.  We don’t need to see a single factor—like bipedality—as being a key factor in the evolution of our mind. (Those single-factor theories have always seemed unrealistic to me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinker recognizes that the “cognitive niche” did not really exist before humans began evolving; it was in many ways &lt;em&gt;constructed&lt;/em&gt; by that evolution itself.  Once we started down our evolutionary road, new possibilities arose that changed the direction of that road itself.   And Pinker pointedly disagrees with Francis Collins and other religious scientists who see the evolution of the human mind as inevitable.  Rather, it was a one-off feature, like the elephant’s trunk or the whale’s baleen basket, that arose via a fortuitous interaction between mutations and the right environmental conditions (big game, an open savanna, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about our ability to do math and philosophy, and all those other endeavors that involve abstract thought?  Pinker sees these as &lt;em&gt;spandrels&lt;/em&gt;, byproducts of reasoning that evolved for other reasons.  Concepts that evolved to deal with concrete situations could naturally be extended to less concrete ones. He gives several examples. Here’s one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we still need an explanation of how our cognitive mechanisms are capable of embracing this abstract reasoning. The key may lie in a psycholinguistic phenomenon that may be called metaphorical abstraction (9, 59–61). Linguists such as Ray Jackendoff, George Lakoff, and Len Talmy have long noticed that constructions associated with concrete scenarios are often analogically extended to more abstract concepts. Consider these sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. a. The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul.&lt;br&gt;
b. The inheritance went to Fred.&lt;br&gt;
c. The light went from green to red.&lt;br&gt;
d. The meeting went from 3:00–4:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sentence (a) uses the verb go and the prepositions from and to in their usual spatial senses, indicating the motion of an object from a source to a goal. But in 1(b), the words are used to indicate a metaphorical motion, as if wealth moved in space from owner to owner. In 1(c) the words are being used to express a change of state: a kind of motion in state-space. And in 1(d) they convey a shift in time, as if scheduling an event was placing or moving it along a time line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . The value of metaphorical abstraction consists not in noticing a poetic similarity but in the fact that certain logical relationships that apply to space and force can be effectively carried over to abstract domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . [A] mind that evolved cognitive mechanisms for reasoning about space and force, an analogical memory that encourages concrete concepts to be applied to abstract ones with a similar logical structures, and mechanisms of productive combination that assemble them into complex hierarchical data structures, could engage in the mental activity required for modern science (9, 10, 67). In this conception, the brain’s ability to carry out metaphorical abstraction did not&lt;br&gt;
evolve to coin metaphors in language, but to multiply the opportunities for cognitive inference in domains other than those for which a cognitive model was originally adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is food for thought—indeed, a banquet—but is it &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;?  It sounds eminently reasonable, but of course we need harder evidence than mere plausibility.  Pinker doesn’t suggest a way to test the “metaphorical abstraction” theory (indeed, I think it’s untestable); but he floats the idea of testing the “cognitive niche” idea by looking at DNA itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory can be tested more rigorously, moreover, using the family of relatively new techniques that detect “footprints of selection” in the human genome (by, for example, comparing rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous base pair substitutions or the amounts of variation in a gene within and across species) (32, 45, 46). The theory predicts that there are many genes that were selected in the lineage leading to modern humans whose effects are concentrated in intelligence, language, or sociality. Working backward, it predicts that any genes discovered in modern humans to have disproportionate effects in intelligence, language, or sociality (that is, that do notmerely affect overall growth or health)will be found to have been a target of selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a clever idea, but it comes with many problems. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if genes for cognitive traits and sociality do show features of the DNA indicating selection (for example, a high rate of substitutions that change protein sequence compared to those that don’t have that effect), it’s not clear that that selection vindicates the “cognitive niche” theory.  It could also support the alternative “one factor at a time” theory; that is, bipedality was the key factor, and that allowed the evolution of manual dexterity, and that allowed hunting, then intelligence, and so on. In other words, the test doesn’t rule out other types of selection that aren’t part of Pinker’s theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along these lines, DNA based evidence for selection could result not from natural selection on survival or reproduction, but from &lt;em&gt;sexual&lt;/em&gt; selection on the ability to find mates.  Sexual selection is explicitly not part of Pinker’s theory, since he sees it as superfluous. But others have suggested that sexual selection was an important factor in the evolution of things like language and mentality.  I take Pinker’s side here, but the point is that we have to rule out alternative explanations, and DNA sequences simply don’t do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geneticists have found a lot of problems with the tests used to show positive selection on DNA.  For one, they are insensitive to forms of selection that only makes &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; changes in proteins, since the tests are designed to detect selection causing &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; protein-coding changes.  Selection producing only one or a few changes in proteins may be ubiquitous, but if you can’t show it, you lose potentially important support for Pinker’s theory.  Conversely, these tests can give false positives if proteins are not changing by &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; selection, but by &lt;em&gt;relaxed&lt;/em&gt; selection that allows mutations to accumulate, as may occur during population bottlenecks (humans, of course, went through a population bottleneck during the out-of-Africa phase).  The paper by Austin Hughes, cited below, enumerates the many problems with the way we currently test DNA for signs of selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we find the candidate genes to test? Pinker suggests looking at those genes that, within humans, either have mutations that affect aspects of cognition or sociality, or that show more common variation affecting those traits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only requirement is that they contribute to the modern human version of these traits. In practice, the genes may be identified as the normal versions of genes that cause disorders of cognition (e.g., retardation, thought disorders, major learning disabilities), disorders of sociality (e.g., autism, social phobia, antisocial personality disorder), or disorders of language (e.g., language delay, language impairment, stuttering, and dyslexia insofar as it is a consequence of phonological impairment). Alternatively, they may be identified as a family of alleles whose variants cause quantitative variation in intelligence, personality, emotion, or language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too has problems.  Genes that can mutate to pathologies &lt;em&gt;involving&lt;/em&gt; cognition, for instance, aren’t necessarily those selected for &lt;em&gt;improved cognition&lt;/em&gt; during our evolution. Signs of selection in those genes might not, then, provide support for the particular form of selection posited by the “cognitive niche” theory.  A gene that evolved to change the jaws of our ancestors, for example, might mutate to something that causes microcephaly or other deformations of the skull, which of course could impair cognition.  But the effect on cognition is an incidental result, and says nothing about past selection &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; cognition.  In fact, one of the genes that Pinker mentions as evidence for his theory, &lt;em&gt;ASPM&lt;/em&gt;—whose mutant form causes microcephaly—is very controversial.  Some geneticists reject the idea that &lt;em&gt;ASPM&lt;/em&gt; changed in our lineage by positive selection, while others don’t think that its normal variation is associated with variation in cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is hemoglobin.  A mutation in human hemoglobin causes sickle-cell anemia, which affects kidney function, joint function, and can even produce prolonged erections.  But even if hemoglobin showed signs of selection in the human lineage (I don’t think it does, but that doesn’t matter), this would not mean that that the evolution of hemoglobin in our lineages involved adaptations in our kidneys, joints, and reproductive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrating on genes whose different forms are associated with less pathological variation may be a better tactic, but there are problems here too. As with &lt;em&gt;ASPM&lt;/em&gt;, it may be difficult to show that normal variation in the genes is associated with normal variation in cognitive and social traits.  And even if it was, this does not allow a strong inference that &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; in those genes between us and our relatives is what makes our minds “human.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, there’s only one convincing way to show that particular DNA differences between the human lineage and those of our relatives (e.g., chimps and gorillas) make a meaningful difference in a cognitive trait.  You must move those bits of DNA &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the species and see if, say, the human form of a gene will improve the cognition of a chimp, or the chimp form of a gene will impair cognition in humans. This involves either hybridization, which is impossible, or transgenic experiments, which are impossible because they are unethical.  And we’re not even talking about how to &lt;em&gt;measure&lt;/em&gt; whether a chimp’s cognition is improved when it carries a new bit of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of how this was done in other species was a recent study by Cretekos et al. (reference below).  The gene &lt;em&gt;Prx1&lt;/em&gt; is known to have mutations in mice that affect elongation of limbs.  Because bats differ from mice in (among other things) growing much longer forelimbs, the researchers sequenced &lt;em&gt;Prx1&lt;/em&gt; genes from fruit bats. They found that the bat DNA differed from mouse DNA in a particular part of the &lt;em&gt;Prx1&lt;/em&gt; gene that regulates its expression.  They then moved that bit from bats into mice by transgenic methods, and found that it increased mouse limb length a bit (about 6%)—but &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; in the forelimbs, just as predicted!  It was a lovely experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the kind of experiment we need to do to make a convincing case that particular genes in the human genome were responsible for making us “human”, i.e., smarter and more socially complex than our relatives. And it’s precisely the experiment that we cannot do, at least for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Pinker’s theory is right—at least, it makes a lot more sense than other theories of human evolution.  But, as always, there’s a big difference between &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; a theory is right and &lt;em&gt;showing&lt;/em&gt; it’s right.  Ironically, in the case of human evolution, we are prevented by our evolved morality from using our evolved skills to test theories about our evolved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

There are several interesting things about those data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, as Wood points out, AIG’s share of the creationist dollar grew over that period, from 61.6% ($9M) of the market in 2003 to 68.2% ($22.7M) in 2008.  AIG’s growth in market share came at the expense of all the other YEC organizations, with the &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/" rel="external "&gt;Institute for Creation Research&lt;/a&gt; (ICR) and and the &lt;a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/" rel="external "&gt;Creation Research Society&lt;/a&gt; (CRS), the two elder U.S. creationist organizations, contributing most of the change.  While ICR’s revenues also increased over those years, from $4,5M to $8.7M, as a percentage of the total creationist dollar it decreased from 30.6% to 26.2% and CRS’s percentage declined from 1.7% to 1.0% as its dollar revenues declined from $250K to $230K.  The smaller YEC organizations also lost share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Eric Hovind, offspring of jailed tax evader Kent Hovind, entered the list in third place in 2008 with his “GodQuest” (DBA Creation Science Evangelism) at $930K for 2.8% of the creationism market, far behind ICR’s $8.7M but well ahead of CRS’s $230K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third (and pretty depressing to see), &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/" rel="external "&gt;NCSE’s&lt;/a&gt; gross revenue as a percentage of AIG’s gross revenue has steadily declined over those years, dropping from 7.8% in 2003 to just 5.7% in 2008.  In 2008, 85% of NCSE’s revenues ($1.1M of $1.3M) came from direct public support–memberships and donations from you and me.  While the amount has increased in absolute terms over those years, as a proportion of creationist revenues it has dropped significantly.  C’mon, people.  Let’s put our money where our mouths are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hat tip to &lt;a href="http://toddcwood.blogspot.com/2010/05/creationist-finances-revisited.html" rel="external "&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt; for doing the digging in form 990s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If one of these planets happens to pass directly between us and its parent star during its orbit, then sensitive spectroscopy can be used to determine the chemical make-up of its atmosphere. Models of such atmospheres predict which gases should be present and in what relative abundances, based on physical conditions such as the temperature. Recent infra red observations carried out with the  have provided the first details of the atmospheric composition of a so-called hot Neptune.The planet, known as , orbits an M-type dwarf star in the constellation of Leo. It is similar to Neptune in size, but orbits its parent star in just 2.6 days. Previous observations of the planet showed that its surface temperature was estimated to be 712 K, higher than predicted due to stellar heating alone, and the new observations () suggest that its atmosphere may not be in equilibrium. The team, led by Kevin Stevenson at the University of Central Florida, observed the planet's day side as it passed around the far side of the star and examined the infra red spectrum for various chemical signatures. What they found was a high abundance of carbon monoxide and a deficiency of methane compared to predictions from atmospheric models at this temperature for an atmosphere thought to be dominated by hydrogen. In an atmosphere such as this, methane (one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms) should be the main carbon-bearing molecule, but the observations show the actual abundance is less than that predicted by a factor of seven thousand. The large amount of absorption due to carbon monoxide is also unexpected, the results suggesting that the atmosphere may not be in thermochemical equilibrium.One alternative explanation considered by the authors is that the atmosphere may not be dominated by hydrogen, but this is unlikely given the dominance of hydrogen in planet forming disks. Another possibility is that vertical mixing within the atmosphere may dredge up carbon monoxide from lower, hotter parts of the atmosphere, although the authors point out that, in order to explain the observed abundances, the amount of mixing would have to be large. These new data will provide useful information for future atmospheric modeling.This blog post is a news story from the , aired in the  edition....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Especially not if you are an exploited species of bivalve.  Now I am not trying to be a climate change apologist, but too often we get caught up in this debate and science is 99% of the time on the side saying &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s bad.&amp;quot;  However, as I have learned in my own research with invasive species, there are always two sides to every coin.  A warming ocean could be a benefit to numerous species, probably as many species as it might be of detriment.  Obviously, there are a whole suite of ecosystem processes that are also affected, but in certain cases, it might not be so bad.  At least not according to a paper in Marine Biology entitled &amp;quot;Strengthening recruitment of exploited scallops Pecten maximus with ocean warming.&amp;quot;  Its an interesting read.  The essential idea is that over a long(ish) time period, the researchers were able to demonstrate a highly significant correlation between increasing temperature and increasing settlement and recruitment of juvenile scallops to a local scallop population.  Shifts in recruitment can be attributed to temperature related shifts in feeding, gonad development and larval survival - and this impacts are more apparent in species who use environmental cues to induce development and spawning.  Such is the case for many species of bivalves, including scallops, and so a warming ocean could potentially enhance scallop recruitment.  There are some stats involved in their methods, but the basic results are pretty simple, over the past decade, scallop landings around the Isle of Man have been increasing.  IN addition, mean springtime temperatures have been increasing (which cues development).  I know what you all might be thinking, correlation does not equal causation (you know the one, mean global temperature has increased as the number of global pirates has decreased, meaning that the number of pirates somehow influences the climate), but that goes into their methods of using residuals and proxy values and all sorts of things.  Basically, recruitment increase isn&amp;#39;t significantly related to other things (spawning stock, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a), and is strongly related to temperature.  They even examined a number of scallops during the three month conditioning period and the GSI - which indicates relative gonad development - was significantly higher in years when temperature was higher.  So when temperature goes up, the scallops develop larger gonads and subsequently release more larvae which show up as strong recruitment classes.So what does this mean for bay scallops? Well, there are plenty of issues with ocean warming and bay scallops - and one of particular concern is predator range expansion and new predators coming into the bay scallops range.  In terms of recruitment, we haven&amp;#39;t seen any patterns that would suggest this is the case in New York.  However, there hasn&amp;#39;t been many scallops here to spawn over the past 20 years until recently - due to the restoration efforts - and there needs to be a local spawning population in order to observe any of the patterns described from the paper.  That said, bay scallop recruitment is not likely to be effected by ocean warming in terms of larger populations - although timing of first spawn might change, the number of times they spawn might change, etc, but it is my opinion that there are numerous variables that influence the size of recruitment classes in local scallop populations, particularly in the bay, which is already a dynamic environment.Shephard, S., Beukers-Stewart, B., Hiddink, J., Brand, A., &amp;amp; Kaiser, M.

He&amp;#39;s also something of a simpering apologist for religion — anything with a whiff of godlessness seems to put him on edge and start him &lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/reply-to-kristof1/"&gt;whining about intolerant, obnoxious atheists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is definitely not the right person to have &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/books/review/Kristof-t.html?ref=books&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;review Ayaan Hirsi Ali's new book&lt;/a&gt;. He might be able to sympathize with the human rights issues she confronts, but at the same time he's got a kind of willful blindness to the contributions religion makes to human misery, and is guaranteed to belittle the problem of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't read Ali's previous book, &lt;i&gt;Infidel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743289692/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0743289692&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0743289692&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0743289692" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, get cracking; you've got to catch up. It was a harrowing description of the life of a Muslim girl in a poor country who managed to escape both poverty and her misogynistic faith. Her new book is &lt;i&gt;Nomad&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1439157316/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=1439157316&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=1439157316&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=1439157316" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, about her move to America. I haven't read it yet, but it's on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kristof&amp;#39;s review is aggravating, though, because it is so thick with — and here I&amp;#39;ll use a word often applied to atheists — condescension. He is a privileged white American male criticizing a black African woman…and he is completely incapable of appreciating her opposition to Islam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, she needs bodyguards.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That's partly because she is by nature a provocateur, the type of person who rolls out verbal hand grenades by reflex. After her father's death, Hirsi Ali connects by telephone with her aging and long-estranged mother living in a dirt-floor hut in Somalia. Hirsi Ali asks forgiveness, but the conversation goes downhill when her mother pleads with her to return to Islam. Near tears, her mother asks: "Why are you so feeble in faith? . . . You are my child and I can't bear the thought of you in hell."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"I am feeble in faith because Allah is full of misogyny," Hirsi Ali thinks to herself. "I am feeble in faith because faith in Allah has reduced you to a terrified old woman -- because I don't want to be like you." What she says aloud is: "When I die I will rot." (For my part, I couldn't help thinking that perhaps Hirsi Ali's family is dysfunctional simply because its members never learned to bite their tongues and just say to one another: "I love you.") &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, it's &lt;i&gt;partly&lt;/i&gt; her fault. Kristof can't bring himself to mention that the reason she is threatened with death, the reason she spoke out, is because she opposes the oppression of women under Islam, something radical Islamists find blasphemous and deserving of death. She holds a reasonable, rational position that has earned her a death sentence from fanatics, and all Kristof can do is make excuses for Islam, saying that they aren't all bad (which we know; if we can't criticize the ideology because some of those who hold it are kind to kittens and give flowers to their grandmothers, we'll end up supporting some heinous regimes with our silence), and it's better for the rude critics to learn some manners and shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's really what that parting line above is about: an outspoken critic of Islam should simply silence herself and mumble consoling platitudes. What Ali wrote is honest and heartfelt: we hate to see loved ones trapped in the fearful web of superstition, and if we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; care, we're willing to tell them exactly what we think, without fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to the marshmallow man, Nicholas Kristof, though. Religion is exempt from dissent, for some reason — a strong atheist can reach out in concern to a family member who responds with more god-fueled terror and anger, and all he sees is someone who wasn&amp;#39;t sufficiently deferential to the superstition that has ruined people&amp;#39;s lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/marshmallow_reviews_fierce_boo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ReNijLfKLNo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275321464650"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=25053">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c5fece12f4395730</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Coming Out"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: Atheist’s Family Finds Out, Shuts Out, Loses Out</title><published>2010-05-31T15:00:22Z</published><updated>2010-05-31T15:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/31/ask-richard-atheist%e2%80%99s-family-finds-out-shuts-out-loses-out/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Richard, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always read your advice letters and they always seem to make sense, so I felt you would be the best person to seek advice from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month ago, I went out of town to visit the university I will be attending in the fall. When I came home, my family began acting very hostile towards me and I didn’t understand why. I endured about three days of constant insults, including being called idiotic when I didn’t even say anything. Finally, one family member explained that one of my books on Atheism was found while I was gone. Of course, I soon realized that this had to have been found by going through my things while I was out of town. I felt betrayed and that I couldn’t even trust my own family. I didn’t even know what possessed them to go through my things. I am now being treated like a stranger amongst my own family just because I am Atheist. They are acting like I am the most untrustworthy and horrible person they know. I have tried to reason with them, but I keep getting interrupted and being told “I don’t want to hear any stupid things out of your mouth.” I don’t get any respect anymore and I’m not even given the opportunity to explain myself. All of my friends respect my beliefs, but I can’t get the same respect from my family. I don’t want to stop talking to the only family I have left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please help,&lt;br&gt;
high school senior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear high school senior,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have received many letters describing the fear, hate, bigotry and cruelty that explodes out of some Christian families toward one family member who is revealed as an atheist, but none of them have so concisely listed the worst of these families’ mistakes as does this short, poignant letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/ask-richard-when-%E2%80%9Ccoming-out%E2%80%9D-may-affect-others/"&gt;emphasize careful forethought&lt;/a&gt; before “coming out” to one’s family. When it is done on your terms and on your time, it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; go better, but sometimes it can get very ugly anyway.  Even families that never showed much interest in practicing their faith can suddenly become reactionary and hostile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your letter is a nearly complete list of the things a Christian family should &lt;em&gt;definitely not&lt;/em&gt; do when they learn of a member’s lack of belief. Not all, but enough families react this way to be giving me an extensive collection of wretched stories with these same features. Every one of these reactions pushes the non-believing member farther away, and reduces any chance to bring them back into the fold: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="list-style-type:disc"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The family criminalizes the atheist, treating them like a dangerous intruder, even though he or she has always been a loyal and loving part of the family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They insult and attack the unbeliever, making bizarre accusations that have no basis in reality and have nothing to do with a simple lack of belief.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They betray the person’s trust, prying and intruding into their private, personal business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These families punish and threaten the atheist member, in the idiotic assumption that they can intimidate or coerce someone back into a sincere and abiding faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally and the most destructive of all, they refuse to permit open, respectful and reasonable communication, shutting it all down when he or she tries to talk to them, not to convince them to disbelieve, but just wanting to be understood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these pious Christian families seem determined to behave in ways that have no resemblance whatsoever to the best teachings of Jesus.  It is as if they have never heard of him. A good measure of how well Christians follow their prophet’s loving wisdom could be how they treat atheists, but even with their own flesh and blood, many utterly fail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In past remarks to other beleaguered atheists, I have explained that very often the root of such anger is fear, and the root of such fear is ignorance. But these are offered as an &lt;em&gt;explanation&lt;/em&gt; for a family’s deplorable abuse, &lt;em&gt;not an excuse.&lt;/em&gt; There is no excuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school senior, I fully understand that you “don’t want to stop talking to the only family you have left,” but other than insults, they are not talking to you, and they are prohibiting you from talking to them.  Communication has to be mutually permitted. It only takes one side to shut it down. They have made a decision to emotionally kick you out.  My heart aches to say it, but until they change that decision, your options for a relationship with them are limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your self esteem must now be based on your own behavior rather than the approval of your loved ones, so behave well.  Since they are currently incapable of behaving with simple decency and courtesy, it is up to you to supply that.  Carry yourself with dignity, good manners and poise.  Ironically, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; may be the one whose treatment of others resembles the best teachings of Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that until you leave in the Fall, you avoid as much as you can any interaction with them that will provoke their abuse of you.  Be as patient and respectful as you can to your family, as long as you protect your own safety.  Do not stoop to returning insult for insult. That does not help you in your situation. It will only be used against you to further justify your family’s contempt for you, and it will escalate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect what little privacy you have left by having a friend store anything you’d rather keep safe from your family’s snooping. Be sure that your internet activities are secure and anonymous.  Young people often end up regretting revealing things online that they &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; were confidential.  Facebook is the bane of many a closeted atheist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of mistreatment and rejection is painful. Find a trustworthy person with whom you can release your hurt; a counselor, a friend, someone who knows how to just listen.   Keep your morale up by increasing your contact with your respectful friends.  See if there is a secular student club at the university, and make some contacts ahead of time. It will be nice to have some allies waiting for you when you get there.  Some may be reading this right now. You are not alone, but you need to start finding your comrades.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you continue to prepare to leave for the university, set things up to be as independent from your family as you possibly can.  This will probably be a gradual process. By increasing your financial, physical and emotional self-reliance, your goal would not be to totally sever contact with them, but to have more choice in exactly how much and what kind of contact you have.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time, distance and absence may permit some calming down. At some point you may be able to start an actual dialogue with them. Sometimes a well-crafted letter, full of genuine love, patience and willingness to talk and listen can reopen channels that were closed down. One family member may be more receptive to you, and he or she might play the role of  diplomat to approach the others. This could take weeks, months or years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school senior, you will soon change your moniker to University Freshman. Your adult life is just beginning. This painful episode will hopefully be but a brief chapter in your autobiography.  Avoid filling it with bitterness of your own to add to your family’s foolishness. Keep your heart open, ready for a reconciliation, keep your mind open, ready to learn new things, and keep your hands open, ready to help another young freethinking person who is enduring a similar hardship.  One of the best ways to heal your hurt is to use it to help heal the hurt of someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://www.compscipbl.com/board/saunders/" title=""&gt;Fenella Saunders&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/" title=""&gt;The American Scientist&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fenalla Saunders pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Fenalla%20Saunders%20pic.jpg" width="288" height="370" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I was born in England, raised in New York City, did my undergraduate at Duke University in North Carolina, went back to New York for 10 years, then came back to NC five years ago. I have a master's degree in animal behavior from Hunter College of the City University of New York, where I did my thesis on the interactions of proboscis monkeys in captivity. My undergraduate degree is in computer science with a minor in Japanese, although I chose my major with the concept of going into science journalism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was at college I discussed the education I would need with a number of science journalists, all of whom told me that an education in science, with outside projects to get journalism experience, was the best way to go. (I am from the era just before when it became pretty much standard for science writers to go to an MA program for science journalism.) A computer science major allowed me to study a broad range of sciences and technology, and it also gave me a backup plan in case journalism didn't work out. At school I wrote for any venue I could get into (and I was lucky that in addition to a regular school paper with a health/medicine section, Duke had both a student-run science and a technology magazine), and in my senior year I wrote a couple of small pieces freelance for Popular Mechanics.   &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My career started when I landed an internship at Discover Magazine, then got hired on. It was largely a matter of luck and timing: They had a lot of biology people and needed someone with a technology background. I stayed at Discover for about eight years, and ended up also being the online editor toward the end of that time. There were a ton of great moments at that job, but I would have to say my favorite one was when they allowed me to start writing about a different, new robot in each month's news section. It was a series that lasted 2-3 years, and I never ran out of new robotics research to write about. During that time I freelanced a little, most notably as a co-author for a Time-Life book called "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Space-2100-Mars-Beyond-Century/dp/1932273050" title=""&gt;Space 2100&lt;/a&gt;." I left Discover to work on publications for NYU School of Medicine for about two years, which was a very different experience. Probably the best part of that job was learning all about really high-powered MRI machines. For the past five years I've been at &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/" title=""&gt;American Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, where I am now a &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/about/" title=""&gt;senior editor&lt;/a&gt;. It is both fascinating and a challenge working with different scientists each issue, trying to get them to explain their own work for a general audience. I couldn't even begin to pick a favorite from all of the articles I've helped bring to print--it could be anything from Champagne bubbles to snow flakes to honeybee nest relocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American Scientist is published every two months, so we always confront the problem of remaining timely. We want to find more ways to keep in contact with our readers between issues. We recently relaunched our Web site, which allowed us to better keep up with technology in a few ways. We're now able to embed video with the online versions of articles. We now also post podcasts of our lunch-speaker series. I am excited that I have been chosen as a fellow to attend on of the Knight Digital Media Center's multimedia workshops, where I'll learn more about how to edit audio, video and maybe program some Flash animation. I am hoping that after I attend that workshop, I will be better equipped to have us do more multimedia for the magazine online. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediacy of the Web still is its biggest advantage in my mind. Something can be posted for all of the world to see within minutes, and if you are looking for information on a specific topic, a quick search will pull up enough reading to last hours. It's a very democratic platform, as anyone can post on it, but that makes it all the more important to make sure that sources are reputable and verifiable--I am pretty sure that we all rely too much on the truthfulness of Wikipedia these days. I am also hopeful that the Web can make information, about science or anything, more accessible to people who, say, don't have the luxury of going to college, or find themselves in a position of having to learn about something new that they never thought about doing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I am still unsure of how the print vs. online debate is going to shake out.  There is something to be said for picking up a whole magazine, not just a specific article you were looking for. It is broadening to be exposed to topics you might not have even realized existed. People are busy, so in some ways it's faster just to pick up a print copy rather than have to search and dig online. Perhaps platforms such as the iPad will change all this. But I know that, when I have the time, just browsing through publications in the library is the best way for me to get new ideas. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fairly bizarre for a publication not to use all social-media platforms possible these days. We send out a daily and a weekly conglomeration of science news, and we tweet about these entries daily as well. We also &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/AmSciMag" title=""&gt;use twitter&lt;/a&gt; to talk about what's in our latest issue, and we tweet about any news that relates to a past story that we have done. We have groups on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/SigmaXi" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?about=&amp;amp;gid=42707" title=""&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. We don't have a set blog yet, although we are working on it, but our Computing Science columnist, Brian Hayes, has a regular one at &lt;a href="http://bit-player.org/" title=""&gt;bit-player.org&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; is a former colleague of mine at &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/" title=""&gt;Discover&lt;/a&gt; magazine, and he was an early entry into the blogosphere, so his was probably the first blog that I followed. I was happy to meet Ed Yong at the conference, and I follow his blog "&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;." I've also been following &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/" title=""&gt;Rebecca Skloot's blog&lt;/a&gt; about her book "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I really liked the fact that there were kids at the conference. Kids often are not brought into the dialogue when discussing science, particularly science journalism. Sometimes they are the target audience, but they are rarely part of the process. For a few years we did a mentoring program with a local middle school where we'd have kids come in for a week, but they'd rotate, so I'd get each student for only one day. I challenged them that they would write a whole science news story by the end of the day, and they all looked at me like I was crazy, but they all did it. Children can do amazing things if given the opportunity, and can provide unique insight. I found it particularly enlightening that the young students at ScienceOnline 2010 thought that Twitter was an adult thing--they saw no real use for it in their lives, preferring more interactive platforms such as Facebook.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I can't say my usual "It was so nice to meet you in person" because I see you often, but certainly thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again soon.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scienceonline2010_-_interview_52.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/nMdsOZdtbPc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275319268873"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/minifalsehood_we_cant_tell_wha.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/18e1dc5af3f8b2e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language"/><title type="html">Minifalsehood: We can't tell what a word is!?!?</title><published>2010-05-31T16:07:23Z</published><updated>2010-05-31T16:07:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/dg4W0v8K2j0/minifalsehood_we_cant_tell_wha.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/minifalsehood_we_cant_tell_wha.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am looking at the question: &lt;em&gt;How many words are there in a language?&lt;/em&gt; I'd like to know for languages in general, comparatively, and for pedagogical reasons, in some well known western language which may as well be English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store was packed. The store sold out all the books before Scott was even done talking. The C-Span &lt;a href="http://www.booktv.org/"&gt;Book TV&lt;/a&gt; crew was there filming so the event will be on TV some day soon. Scott was also, earlier yesterday, on WUNC's &lt;a href="http://wunc.org/tsot/archive/on-the-grid/view"&gt;The State Of Things&lt;/a&gt; (the podcast will soon be online &lt;a href="http://wunc.org/tsot/archive/podcast.xml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and the day before that he was on KERA's Think with Krys Boyd (&lt;a href="http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/77/510036/127094965/KERA_127094965.mp3"&gt;download MP3 podcast by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott's energy and enthusiasm are infectuos. He held the audience captive and often laughing. The questions at the end were smart and his answers perfectly on target. But most importantly, we all learned a lot last night. I think of myself as a reasonably curious and informed person, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/10/field_trip_water_sewage_and_fl.php"&gt;I have visited&lt;/a&gt; at least a couple of infrastructure plants, but almost every anecdote and every little tidbit of information were new to me. Scott's point - that we don't know almost anything about infrastructure - was thus proven to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Scott realized during the two years of research for the book is that people in charge of infrastructure know what they are doing. When something doesn't work well, or the system is not as up-to-date as it could be, it is not due to incompetence or ignorance, but because there is a lack of two essential ingredients: money and political will. These two factors, in turn, become available to the engineers to build and upgrade the systems, only if people are persuaded to act. And people are persuaded to act in two ways: if it becomes too costly, or if it becomes too painful to continue with the old way of doing things. It is also easier to build brand new systems for new services than it is to replace old systems that work 'well enough' with more more modern ways of providing the same service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="huler 002.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/huler%20002.JPG" width="336" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;There are people who advocate for moving "off the grid" and living a self-sufficient existence. But, as Scott discovered, they are fooling themselves. Both the process of moving off the grid and the subsequent life off the grid are still heavily dependent on the grid, on various infrastructure systems that make such a move and such a life possible, at least in the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is really astonishing is how well the systems work, even in USA which has fallen way behind the rest of the developed world. We are taking it for granted that the systems always work, that water and electricity and phone and sewers and garbage collection and public transportation always work. We get angry on those rare occasions when a system temporarily fails. We are, for the most part, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/casaubonsbook/2010/05/department_of_redundancyredund.php"&gt;unprepared and untrained&lt;/a&gt; to provide some of the services ourselves in times of outages, or to continue with normal life and work when a service fails. And we are certainly not teaching our kids the necessary skills - I can chop up wood and start a wood stove, I can use an oil heater, I know how to slaughter and render a pig, how to get water out of a well, dig a ditch, and many other skills I learned as a child (and working around horses) - yet I am not teaching any of that to my own kids. They see it as irrelevant to the modern world and they have a point - chance they will ever need to employ such skills is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="grid_cover.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/grid_cover.jpg" width="250" height="362" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I got the book last night and am about to start reading it - very eagerly so. Scott started with his house in Raleigh and traced all the wires and cables and pipes going in and out of the house to see where they led. He compared what he learned in Raleigh and its various infrastructure experts and officials, to the equivalent services in other geographical places, and traced them back in history. I can't wait to read the synthesis of all that research. I hope you will read it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After more than three years of research and the passage of billion of billions of particles travelling from one part of the Alps to another, the metamorphosis of a neutrino has been directly observed for the first time ever, at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories of the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare - INFN) in Gran Sasso (LNGS). This metamorphosis consists of the transformation of one type of neutrino into another, a result that will pave the way for New Physics, although it will obviously have to be confirmed by additional observations of "mutating" neutrinos such as this first one.

&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon was observed by the international collaboration OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus). Neutrinos are "shot" from the European laboratory of CERN in beams directed to the Gran Sasso: in a mere 2.4 milliseconds they travel 732 kilometres beneath the Earth's crust to the core of the Gran Sasso Mountain in the Abruzzo Region and, during their journey, there is the possibility that some of them "change" their nature. [...] For 15 years a number of experiments have revealed the neutrino oscillation through disappearance of neutrinos coming from the atmosphere, the Sun, and other sources. However, this is the likely the first time that a neutrino that has oscillated from one type into another has been directly observed. It is as if, after having learned of a crime, the victim's body has finally been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1268443"&gt;CERN has a nice video on the event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/functoruser/78728221/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/church_and_state.jpg" alt="church_and_state" title="church_and_state" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the most basic principles of the United States, written out in the very first Amendment of the Bill of Rights, is that the government will neither endorse nor deny any specific religion, or interfere with anyone’s ability to worship or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty straightforward. You have the right to your religion, and I have the right to mine. You even have the right to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a religion. But no matter what, &lt;em&gt;you have the right to not have your religion interfered with&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Workman, a (now-graduated) high school student in Greenwood, Indiana, understood this. That’s why, when his school administration decided to let the seniors vote on whether they wanted to have an official school-sanctioned prayer at graduation, he tried to get it stopped. He wound up having to take the case to the ACLU, and a judge ordered that no school-sanctioned prayer could be held at the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to discuss here, but the most important things to remember during any of it are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Eric is correct, and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Eric is Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, he’s not some baby-eating atheist waiting to escort the souls of the graduating class to Satan’s doorstep. He’s a Christian, but even in that extremely conservative area he understands that the Constitution, and our Founding Fathers, got it right.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another extremely important thing to remember is that &lt;em&gt;no one was keeping these students from praying&lt;/em&gt;. They had the right to pray as much as they wanted to before, during, and after the ceremony. The class president stood up and thanked God in her speech, and &lt;em&gt;she had every right to do so&lt;/em&gt;, just as Eric had the right to talk about how important secularism is in school (&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/c9jd9/2010_gchs_valedictory_speech_ama/"&gt;the complete text of his speech is on reddit&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing being prevented here was state-sponsored support of religion. That’s it. With all this in mind, watch &lt;a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/video/23716117/index.html"&gt;the coverage this got on the local news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Memorial Day in the United States, where we take time to remember those who have died, and specifically those who have fought and died for the country. In my opinion, they didn’t fight to protect our country, they fought to protect the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of our country. The principles for which it stands, the ideas and ideals that give people the chance to reach their full potential. That’s what America is supposed to be about, and the framework that provides that chance is the Constitution. It does not limit what the people can do&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it limits how the government can in turn limit them. You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allowed to speak freely. You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allowed to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allowed your religion, or lack thereof. The government cannot stop that, but neither can it actively support it. That way, &lt;em&gt;everyone has the same rights&lt;/em&gt;, and it keeps the government from turning into a theocracy. This should be something advocated by not just the non-religious, and, in fact, should be most loudly supported by the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; religious. It’s their rights being protected too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration of Greenwood High School lost track of that simple fact, but ironically, their own education system worked. One student &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; learn it, and schooled the administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it makes me happy — and proud, as an American — to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/doomed_indiana_not.jpg" alt="doomed_indiana_not" title="doomed_indiana_not" width="400" height="302"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; And the one time it tried to limit personal freedom — &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States"&gt;the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, prohibiting alcohol — was a massive, stupid, and expensive disaster from which many people still haven’t learned anything. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

If you are in the midlands, then do go along to their meetings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Birmingham has a great tradition of free thought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has always had a certain anarchic quality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spilling over three counties for much of its history, it was free from any coherent local government. Until the mid 1800s Birmingham made do with statutory "Street Commissioners". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when it was granted borough status, the townspeople were less than enthusiastic. Indeed, the local council met most regularly not at some grand public building, but at a public house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such nonchalance was not really sustainable as Birmingham grew into the second city of the United Kingdom, and in the 1870s Joseph Chamberlain's flair for self-promotion meant that Birmingham appeared suddenly to be the best governed town in the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, it was only catching up with other industrial towns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Birmingham was always more of market town than an industrial town, though it was one where small businesses could easily set up. Before the Cadburys there was really little large scale factory production. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And matched with this commercial freedom was intellectual freedom. The local Anglican church was weak. The town attracted freethinkers and non-conformists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most notably, it was the home of the Lunar Society, a group of the pre-eminent intellectuals of the day. They met once a month, and were known to some as the Lunatics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there are the Birmingham Skeptics. They too meet once a month, like the Lunar Society; and they also meet in a pub, like those sensible mid-Victorian councillors. So in these ways, at least, they are fully within the liberal and libertine traditions of Britain's greatest city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they are more than a parochial discussion group. Birmingham Skeptics are part of a worldwide movement of skeptics groups, from Perth to Boston. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Skepticism is effortlessly internationalist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so is Birmingham. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It manufactured goods for the world for nearly two hundred years, and over the last fifty years it has in turn thrived because of immigration and cultural diversity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Birmingham Skeptics will have a natural role in the forward movement of the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the foundation of Birmingham Skeptics is a welcome move. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skepticism is coming home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6144402934830984184?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275315223032"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/irish_meeting_in_a_bar_tonight.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75c45a7807b3b3ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Irish meeting in a bar tonight</title><published>2010-05-31T14:29:46Z</published><updated>2010-05-31T14:29:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/TBQUiT308v0/irish_meeting_in_a_bar_tonight.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/irish_meeting_in_a_bar_tonight.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know, unbelievable, isn't it?

One  is , an F-type supergiant in the constellation of Auriga, located at an estimated distance of 625 parsecs (2,100 light years). Since its variable nature was discovered in the 1820s, the star has been seen to fade in brightness every 27.1 years. During these eighteen-month-long eclipses, the brightness of the star fades to around 50 per cent of its normal magnitude. While the variability of the system has been well-studied, the exact physical nature of the eclipsing companion is less certain as it has remained undetected, and many models have been put forward to explain the unusual nature of the system. Observations of epsion Aurigae show that the star and its darker companion have a similar mass which, until recently, was thought to be around 15 times the mass of the Sun.  have shown that the supergiant star has a much lower mass of between two and three solar masses, and that the companion may be a single B5V-type star embedded within a disk of opaque material.Now, using the CHARA interferometer, an array of infrared telescopes located on Mount Wilson in California, a team led by Brian Kloppenborg from the University of Denver have . This is the first time a spatially resolved observation of an eclipsing binary has been made. Their observations show that the eclipsing object is an opaque disk of dust, tilted to our line of sight by an estimated 84 degrees. From the motion of the disk between two observations carried out in November and December 2009, the team infer that the companion object is more massive than the visible F-type supergiant. Assuming the B-type star within the disk has a typical mass of 5.9 solar masses, the researchers calculate a mass of 3.6 solar masses for the F-type supergiant. They also calculate that if the disk is composed entirely of dust, then its mass is less than 10 per cent of the Earth's.While the nature of the disk is now clearer, there are still several unanswered questions which remain. The model that best fits the data is of a geometrically thin disk tilted to our line of sight, rather than a thick disk seen edge on. However, the fact that it is opaque suggests that its nature is more like a debris disk than a dusty accretion disk around a young stellar object. The tilted disk model also predicts a central hole which should cause a mid-eclipse brightening of the F-type star. Observers the world-over will continue to monitor the system during the eclipse, and the data should help build up a profile of the disk and constrain the evolutionary history of the system.This blog post is a news story from the , aired in the  edition....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Carbon dioxide.

A forthcoming paper by Biewbower and Cooper caught my eye because it incidentally supports a contention in the last paper I co-authored on crustacean nociception (Puri &amp;amp; Faulkes 2010). We couldn’t find any evidence that crustaceans responded to acids.

The new paper isn’t actually interested in acids; it’s all about what carbon dioxide does to crayfish. The first question is, can crayfish detect changes in carbon dioxide concentrations at all?

The authors ran crayfish through a Y-maze: one arm with high CO2 concentrations, and one without. The higher the carbon dioxide concentrations, the more the crayfish tended to avoid that end of the maze, suggesting that yes, the crayfish can detect carbon dioxide in water. They also found that when placed in a pool containing high levels of carbon dioxide, crayfish would leave the water to cross in the air to a chamber with lower levels.

Another possible interpretation is that the crayfish aren’t detecting carbon dioxide in these experiments, but a lack of oxygen. It could also be low pH. When you ramp up the concentration of carbon dioxide in water, create carbonic acid. This is why burning fossil fuels is leading to ocean acidification. Crayfish could have avoided the end of the maze because they detected the low oxygen or low pH rather than the carbon dioxide specifically.

Consequently, they created two control conditions in addition to regular water. First, they created a low-oxygen water by bubbling nitrogen through it. Crayfish did not discriminate between the nitrogen laden water and the regular water. Second, they made one end of the Y maze with normal CO2 concentrations, but acidic pH; about 4.85.

And the crayfish walked right into it.

No difference between the regular water and the acidic. So their study supports ours: decapod crustaceans seem to be mostly ignorant of changes in pH.

Another interpretation might be that the animals are responding to low oxygen; to control for that, the authors also had a control condition with very high nitrogen concentrations in the water, which lowered oxygen, and again, the crayfish didn’t distinguish between that and regular water.

Bierbower and Cooper also found that at high concentrations, carbon dioxide does a number on the crayfish, effectively putting them out of action stopping their heart and ventilation (“breathing,” more or less).

Why are crayfish repelled by high levels of carbon dioxide? Not clear. Bierbower and Cooper suggest that high levels of carbon dioxide might be a cue that an environment is toxic. That said, these are swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), and they probably have a pretty high tolerance for low quality water. It would be interesting to see if crayfish that favour highly oxygenated streams might be more sensitive to carbon dioxide concentrations.

While very interesting to me because of its relevance to a story I’ve been working on (crustacean nociception), this paper might have limited interest to others. Both the introduction and discussion are very general, and don’t convey a strong sense of where this fits into a broader research picture.

And this time, I was struck by something that was neither in the play's text nor in the performers' interpretation, but rather in the audience's reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was someone in the back of the theater with a  loud and infectious laugh,   who didn&amp;#39;t laugh at any of the obviously funny lines, but instead  laughed — maybe a hundred times — at a selection of lines that is not easy to characterize.  And laughter being the sort of thing it is, a few other audience members would erratically join in, few enough that the individual characteristics of their laughs soon became familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laugher's interventions mostly seemed to me to be points where a character changed the subject, or said  something that was unexpected in the context of the previous discourse, or said  or did something awkward or socially uneasy. These are traditional occasions for nervous laughter, though usually not so regular or so loud in a public setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were other theories.  One person thought that the laugher might have been a friend of a couple of the actors, who reacted whenever one of them entered the on-stage conversation. Another theory was that the laugher was reacting when the actors made certain expressive faces. These are obviously overlapping theories, and many others might be devised as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actors reacted in different ways, which reflected their characters' characters, and (IMO) helped save the performance.  Natasha glared in the laugher's general direction, as if he'd left a dirty fork on her parlor table;  Irina slumped dejectedly, as if this were one more evidence of the stupidity of her provincial surroundings;  Masha seemed to be on the verge of cracking up, and (perhaps because of her attempts to suppress a fit of giggles) developed a brittle, sardonic smirk that suggested how close her character was to cracking in a different sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal laughter is actually rather weird and hard to explain, but  because it's familiar, we don't generally recognize how odd it is. It  takes an abnormal laugher, like the one I encountered Saturday night, to  bring this point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an empirical sort of person, I wish that I had a recording of that performance to analyze, to see how well my memory accords with the facts. And in fact, a corpus of audience reactions to performances in smallish theaters (this one was an audience of 80-100) might shed some interesting light on the individual and social psychology of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275314620697"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3501">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12fa5417e8929889</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="Alexander Library"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="AVN"/><category term="information"/><category term="Meryl Dorey"/><category term="news"/><category term="Perth"/><category term="vaccination"/><category term="website"/><category term="Western Australia"/><title type="html">New Website For Those Attending The Perth AVN Lecture – Vaccination Facts</title><published>2010-05-31T10:46:15Z</published><updated>2010-05-31T10:46:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/vufhBk_-w-4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/05/new-website-for-those-attending-the-perth-avn-lecture-vaccination-facts/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear fellow skeptics, scientists and concerned citizens,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com"&gt;Vaccination Facts&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com"&gt;A Response To Meryl Dorey And The AVN At Perth’s State Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if you’ve been following the case of the &lt;a href="http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com"&gt;Australian Vaccination Network&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, but they are an anti-vaccination group who have been extremely proactive in promoting pseudoscience in the Eastern states of this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their vaccination-conspiracy lectures have been commented upon and challenged by likes of the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/"&gt;Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href="http://www.scepticsbook.com/"&gt;Dr Rachael Dunlop&lt;/a&gt; (presenter at NECSS 2009 and fellow reporter of the Skeptic Zone podcast). &lt;a href="http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com"&gt;Meryl Dorey&lt;/a&gt;, the spokesperson for the AVN, was the winner of the ‘Bent Spoon Award’ in 2009 by the Australian Skeptics (the equivalent of the Randi ‘Pigasus Award’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a national advertisement was run, sponsored by Dick Smith, to further raise awareness of their misinformation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/podblack/3822528701"&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/podblack/3822528701&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they are coming to my town, in Western Australia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/05/statelibrarywa-promoting-dangerous-pseudoscience-not-really-a-fairy-tale-about-meryl-dorey-and-the-avn/"&gt;http://podblack.com/2010/05/statelibrarywa-promoting-dangerous-pseudoscience-not-really-a-fairy-tale-about-meryl-dorey-and-the-avn/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, despite our efforts to encourage venues not to allow them to book a lecture space, they have managed to find a place at the &lt;a href="http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/"&gt;State Library of Western Australia, called the Alexander Library in central Perth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A new website has been created in response to the AVN coming to Perth, Western Australia’s State Library, to lecture on June 1st:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com/"&gt;http://vaccinationfacts.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you please promote this website as best you can, in order to help raise awareness of it and hopefully challenge the lecture that is going to be run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw Phaedra Boinodiris speak as the opening speaker at &lt;a href="http://www.tedxtrianglenc.com/"&gt;TEDxRTP&lt;/a&gt; (my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/tedxrtp.php"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;) back in March, but this was a different kind of talk, geared more towards scientists and science communicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember playing Pong when it first came out. I remember spending many hours back in 1980 or so playing The Hobbit on Sinclair ZX Spectrum. And I played many games at arcades (still not knowing which games started out as arcade games adapted to computers and which the other way round). Then I quit playing games for a couple of decades until my kids were ready for them. I loved &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombinis"&gt;Zoombinis&lt;/a&gt; - an amazing game of logic and a brilliant preparation for taking IQ tests! I loved &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scarry%27s_Busytown"&gt;Richard Scarry's Busytown&lt;/a&gt; - the one and only game I know about infrastructure, where players build stuff and deliver it to others for the good of the town - from baking bread to paving roads - learning along the way how those things are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure, Phaedra Boinodiris started with a slide depicting Pong (to the chuckle of the audience) but soon got into the real stuff - the serious gaming and the story of &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1638401/gaming-is-serious-business-even-at-ibm"&gt;how she got involved in developing such games&lt;/a&gt;, as well as about studies of gaming and how different kinds of games help develop different real-work skills, from eye-hand coordination to leadership to cooperation. Her first game - &lt;a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/innov8/index.html"&gt;INNOV8&lt;/a&gt; - was developed as &lt;a href="http://educationaltoysgalore.com/ibm-creating-effective-learning-games-phaedra-boinodiris.htm"&gt;a prototype, a proof of concept, in only three months&lt;/a&gt; and instantly became a huge hit. It is used by businesses and business schools around the world to teach Business Process Management. It is essentially a first person shooter game (without guns) in which the player is brought as an outside consultant into a company where s/he has to figure out the flow, the bottlenecks, etc. (including by interviewing employees, as well as data-sheets) and experiment in making it more efficient. The 2.0 version came &lt;a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/innov8/full.html"&gt;soon after&lt;/a&gt;, adding such problems as traffic, customer service and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/bid79HDZUZs%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next game, &lt;a href="http://www.gamersdailynews.com/story-17566-IBM-Serious-Game-Tackles-Urban-Challenges.html"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; and coming out in October 2010, will be a Sim-City-like serious game &lt;a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/solutions/soa/innov8/cityone/index.html"&gt;CityOne&lt;/a&gt;, designed to help city planners, town councils, citizens, and engineers plan better, more efficient infrastructure for their cities. Put in your city's specs and start building new infrastructure, see how much it will cost, see what problems will arise, see what solutions are available - probably something you could not have thought of yourself and may be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am currently reading &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/2010/05/scott-huler-on-the-grid-at-quail-ridge-books/"&gt;'On The Grid'&lt;/a&gt; it occured to me that the developers of CityOne should read that book, and that Scott Huler should be given a test-run of the game, perhaps for him to review for Charlotte Observer and Raleigh News&amp;amp;Observer and the local NPR station. And for &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/"&gt;Science In The Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a day when we remember our war dead, but the three day weekend that accompanies the last Monday in May is also viewed as the unofficial start of summer. Consequently, I decided to take it easy and simply post a bit of e-mail from a reader apparently with the 'nym trose313:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You need a good dose of positive energy.  Such negative rantings cannot be good.  Plus, you are very one sided, which is never good. There is a lot of wonderful alternative treatments out there and when one hides behind such slanted information as you, I tend to wonder what the motivation is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, trose (or T. Rose, or whoever). Nice stab at the implied evil motivation. I'm surprised you didn't use the dreaded &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/the_pharma_shill_gambit_1.php"&gt;pharma shill gambit&lt;/a&gt;. As for the good dose of "positive energy," personally I consider promoting science and reason, not to mention explaining why pseudoscience is pseudoscience, is positive energy. Still, I'll take in a bit of "positive energy" today by not going to work and not doing much. That's as positive as it gets today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, don't forget the real reason for the holiday, buried under the weekend trips, barbecues, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/opening_oracs_holiday_mailbag.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/r8ahIMky8TY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275311809223"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=8774">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d773bd68ff590c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><category term="bonobos"/><category term="bonobo handshake"/><category term="vanessa woods"/><category term="violence against women"/><title type="html">Women Against Violence – Be More Bonobo!</title><published>2010-05-31T13:16:26Z</published><updated>2010-05-31T13:16:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/05/31/women-against-violence-be-more-bonobo/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">This is a guest post from Vanessa Woods, author of the new book, Bonobo Handshake. Vanessa is a Research Scientist in Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and studies the cognition of chimpanzees and bonobos in Congo.

In the US, 600 women are sexually  assaulted every day. One woman is beaten by her partner every 15 seconds.  Despite education campaigns and law enforcement, and penalties, violence  continues to threaten women throughout America. What can we do to make  women safe?

I believe bonobos may have the answer.  Once I saw Tatango, an unusually aggressive bonobo male, run up to Mimi,  the alpha female, and backhand her across the face. He hit her so hard  he almost gave her whiplash. Within seconds, five females in the group  ran to Mimi’s rescue. They chased Tatango around the night building  until he fled into the forest. When he continued his aggressive outbursts,  those five females beat him so badly, they damn near ripped off his  testicles. After that, Tatango never caused another problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favourite instrument: well-played violin. My least favourite instrument: all other forms of violin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear snob. While you were looking down your nose at all of us, we were looking up it. Here’s a kleenex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about the persistence of pagan influences, you can always pray to St. Contradictus, patron saint of strict monotheism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound really obvious, but has anyone at BP tried jiggling the handle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is now on to Plan B3, otherwise known as deniacin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just got back from the rifle range and my arm is killing me. Next time someone else can hold the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when that crappy band Nickelback used to always be on the radio? WHAT? Oh god, you thawed me out too early!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to always be at the front of the line, huh? Well, from now on your name is Zzaardvark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back, I wish there had been a clear book explaining the rules of English grammar. I simply would have had to have had to have it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saw a sign that read “Patience training while you wait”. Or at least I wish I had. That would have been really funny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smokers: you do realize that cigarette butts are visible to the rest of us, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you see a smoker casually flick a cigarette butt in public, flick a big booger and say “At least mine’s biodegradable, jackass”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I floss regularly? Like clockwork. Twice a day for three days every six months, immediately preceding a dental appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re both enjoying this argument, let’s agree not to agree to disagree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left early to beat the traffic. Did the terrorists win? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the thumb dropped out of the debate, the remaining fingers were free to make their points unopposed.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me save you the trouble of looking and say that it’s not what it sounds like — there’s actually nothing at all in potholes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don’t like owing people money. So can I just have some, then? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet Superman wouldn’t be so tough without all those superpowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think people living in California by default should build earthquake-proof houses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Staples to find something appropriate to store my Lord of the Rings jokes in, but the best they had was three rings to bind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a PETA add with several attractive women saying “I’d rather go naked than wear fur”. Please, no one tell them there’s a third option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t do so well under pressure. However, I am very calm under anaesthetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent extra to get the automatic lawn tractor. Turns out I still have to drive it around myself to keep the grass cut.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formal name is flavaflavin, but you probably know it as Vitamin B-ooooooyyyy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember when “inexpensive” and “cheap” could be used interchangeably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was seriously injured in a bungee jumping accident. The doctors think it’s very unlikely that he’ll ever bounce back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know he has an artificial joint in his leg, but does he have to exaggerate his limp so much? (Faux knee phony). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a sentence with “If you ask me” almost always indicates that no one asked you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid I didn’t know any better, but I’m retroactively offended that the Dukes of Hazzard car had a confederate flag on it. FU, Bo &amp;amp; Luke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gentle reminder to my fellow men. Not all toilets in public washrooms have the auto-flush feature yet, so don’t just walk away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New invention: faternity jeans. Like elastic waist maternity jeans, but for men with an expanding spare tire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet almost no one would notice if we replaced all the sprigs of parsley in the world with reusable plastic replicas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine turned 40 today. It seems like only yesterday he was still in his 30s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were you, I wouldn’t give Bruce Banner anything sold in a blister pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that menstruation is unpleasant and inconvenient, but it’s something that every boyfriend has to learn to live with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I don’t understand is why everyone else but me makes extremely annoying noises when they eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer a laptop dance, because then I can also still get some work done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how the trip back always seems much quicker than the trip there? I bet that sensation is particularly acute when skydiving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the voice of K.I.T.T. for my GPS. Overall it’s really cool, although he gets pretty snarky whenever I want to use the turbo boost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great power comes a costume made of spandex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever type a word and then get that odd feeling that it couldn’t really be spelled that way? I totally just had that with Eyjafjallajökull. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I before E, except after C. Weird. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say tom-ay-to. You have a weird accent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love is a battlefield; what’s love got to do with it? Amen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guys, don’t call them “chick flicks” — that’s so crass. The correct term is “vaginema”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be hard for mafia thugs to convey sincere appreciation for the quality of an establishment and concern for its continued well-being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions speak louder than words. Especially if that action is yelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a fur coat, but I do have cats and several dark sweaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find my nose is always itchiest right before I scratch it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a very good chance that you don’t understand probability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell a lot about someone by the words they choose to use in their autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking: “No, you don’t”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My wife wrote letters to the Swedish authorities for her Chinese dad from the time she was 11. And when time rolled around for the biannual talk with the teachers about each pupil's scholastic progress, she was accompanied by her sister (1½ years older). I hear that such a setup, with all that it means for power relations in the family, can be a big problem for men from more strongly patriarchal traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're planning Juniorette's seventh birthday party, and we're a little late. So instead of sending cards I called every family on the guest list. When I called little Juanita's home, she picked up the phone herself. I identified myself as Juniorette's dad and asked to talk to mom or dad. Juanita replied in a very civil tone and with perfect pronunciation that Mother doesn't like to talk to telephone salesmen. After a little extra explanation, comprehension dawned and Juanita seamlessly switched into interpreter mode. I heard the mother in the background speaking Spanish (which I understand reasonably well if spoken slowly but cannot speak myself), and then I got a flawless Swedish interpretation from Juanita. At one point I got to talk a little to the mother myself, but it wasn't any use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think I got the message across. But just to make sure, I've written an invitation in English, run it through Google Translate to make some kind of Spanish of it, and printed it out. I'm cycling over to put it in their mail box.&lt;/p&gt;

A number of family and twin studies of the heritability of sexual orientation, starting in the 1950’s, found significant genetic influences: the statistical likelihood of an individual being homosexual increased somewhat if they had a homosexual  dizygotic (fraternal) twin and dramatically if they had a homosexual monozygotic (identical) twin.  However, these studies have generally suffered from some methodological limitations, including small sample sizes, the possibility of ascertainment bias due to the methods of recruitment of participants and an assumption that homosexuality in males and females is likely caused by the same mechanisms.   This assumption reflects a common idea that heterosexuality represents the same default state in both males and females – that it is the “normal”, baseline condition, one that requires no active processes.  In fact, there is not a single rule: “be attracted to members of the opposite sex” – there are two rules: either be attracted to males or be attracted to females.  These “rules” are embodied in anatomical and physiological differences in neural circuitry controlling sexual desire and behaviour, which differ between heterosexual males and females. (See: Wired for Sex for more on these processes in male brains).  Understanding that both these behavioural rules require active and possibly distinct neurodevelopmental processes to establish makes it much easier to appreciate how alterations to those processes can lead to exceptions to how those rules are expressed.  Three recent twin studies have largely overcome previous methodological issues, demonstrate clear genetic influences on sexual orientation and argue strongly that homosexuality in males and females is due to distinct mechanisms.  These studies all used large, population-based samples – that is, the subjects were not recruited to the study based on sexual orientation – in Sweden, Finland and Australia.  In each study, rates of homosexuality were compared between pairs of monozygotic or dizygotic (same-sex or opposite-sex) twins.  Each study had several thousand participants and several hundred twin pairs, making them well-powered statistically to detect genetic or environmental effects on sexual orientation.   These studies differed significantly in how they assessed sexual orientation, however, which may be reflected in their results.  Zietsch and colleagues in the Australian study used a questionnaire to assess sexual attraction on a seven-point “Kinsey” scale, from exclusive heterosexual attraction to some degree of homosexual attraction.  In response to this question, 11% of men and 13% of women, were rated as non-heterosexual.  Alanko and colleagues in the Finnish study used a composite measure of same-sex attraction and same-sex sexual contact.  In this survey,  6.1% of men and 6.6% of women reported a homosexual orientation.  Interestingly, the quantitative measures used demonstrated a much more bimodal distribution in males than in females, mirroring previous observations that bisexuality is much more common in females than in males (males tending to be either strongly heterosexual or strongly homosexual).  Langstrom and colleagues used a direct question about lifetime number of same-sex sexual partners, with 5.6% of men and 7.8% of women reporting at least one – among those reporting at least one, men reported significantly more same-sex partners.    Estimates of genetic influences were high across all three studies.  The Australian study found heritability of 48% for sexual orientation across males and females together.  The Finnish study estimated genetic influences on sexual orientation of 45% and 50% for men and women, respectively.  Neither study found any evidence of an effect of shared environment.  The Swedish study gave somewhat different results – the heritability for male heterosexuality was quite high, 39%, with no effect of a shared environment.  However, the estimated heritability for female heterosexuality was lower in this study, around 18-19%, and a significant contribution from the shared environment was found for females in this study (16-17%).  These differences could reflect sampling effects, population genetic or cultural differences, or the differences in how sexual orientation was assessed (based on actual same-sex sexual behaviour in the Swedish study).  It is important to note that a shared family environment for dizygotic twins includes a shared uterine environment, which may impact on neural development.   Importantly, both the Australian and the Finnish studies found zero correlation of homosexuality across opposite-sex dizygotic twin pairs, while same-sex dizygotic twin pairs showed substantial correlations.  So, if a male has a fraternal twin brother who is homosexual, there is a significantly increased likelihood that he will also be.  This is not the case if his twin sister is homosexual (and vice versa).   The major conclusion from these studies corroborates previous findings: sexual orientation is strongly influenced by genetics.  Whatever the underlying biological processes, they are likely different for males and females, as reflected in differences in reports of same-sex attraction and expression of sexual behaviour, with males showing a more bimodal distribution.  The potential neurobiological processes involved will be the subject of a later post.   Those are the sc...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Also, I've just returned from APS (see my daily recaps here here and here), and I am TIRED.

Domestic animals and their wild counterparts can be different in big ways; there can be differences in morphology (physical characteristics), physiology, and behavior. These changes may depend on spontaneous adaptations to captivity or to artificial selection pressures arising from the motivation for domesticating the animal in the first place.

One change that is often observed as a result of domestication is a general reduction in relative brain size. This reduction has been observed in all species that have been investigated with only one exception: the house mouse (mus musculus). Importantly, this reduction is not simply a result of increased body size. Despite the fact that it has not been scientifically explored, many assume that the reductions in brain size are reflected in a similar reduction in brain function. In other words: smaller brains (relative to body size) and dumber animals.

Why? Because I really liked that post and felt like it. Also, there seems to be something about the number nine among anti-vaccine zealots: Nine “questions.” Nine circles of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine straw men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m referring to an amazing post that appeared on the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism over the weekend by contributing editor Julie Obradovic entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/the-difference-between-you-and-me.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Difference Between You and Me&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, Julie describes not one difference, but nine differences, that she perceives between herself (and, apparently, by generalization other parents who have become believers in the myth that vaccines cause autism) and people like SBM contributors and (I hope) the vast majority of our readers, who support science-based medicine, understanding that correlation does not necessarily equal causation and that, most importantly, science not only does not support the belief that vaccines cause autism but provides us with copious evidence that there almost certainly no link between the two. Actually, there are more than nine differences, as Ms. Obradovic packs multiple apparently related differences around each of her nine “differences” and then complains that Alison Singer and, apparently by generalization the rest of us who support SBM and oppose the anti-vaccine movement, misrepresent the reasons why she and her merry band of anti-vaccine activists reject the science that has failed spectacularly to validate their deeply held belief that vaccines cause autism and all sorts of other health consequences. Her post ends up being a collection of straw men constructed to Burning Man size, each of which she then applies a flamethrower of burning nonsense to with self-righteous gusto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no doubt Ms. Obradovic won’t see it that way, the reason I chose her article as an introduction for this post is not to pick on her (although if you look at &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/julie-obradovic/" rel="nofollow"&gt;her other posts on AoA&lt;/a&gt;, particularly her equally large city of straw men entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/how-to-actually-save-the-vaccine-program.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Actually Save the Vaccine Program&lt;/a&gt;) she certainly deserves some picking on for her combination of pseudoscience, logical fallacies, and straw men). Rather, it’s because her collection of straw men are highly illustrative of what supporters of SBM have to deal with when dealing with pseudoscience and quackery. Ms. Obradovic’s “nine differences” may be all about vaccine-autism mythology and victimization that those mean and nasty scientists don’t take her beliefs seriously, but they could be about almost any form of non-science-based medicine. If you don’t believe me, do this simple thing. Wherever Ms. Obradovic writes “vaccines,” insert your favorite woo &lt;em&gt;du jour&lt;/em&gt; and then channel the all-purpose quackery crank site Whale.to or NaturalNews.com. It doesn’t work for all of them (the part about the government “mandating” vaccines, for instance), but it works for enough of them to show my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why I’m going to discuss Ms. Obradovic’s collection of massive straw men peppered with other logical fallacies is that her attitude is not unique. What she writes demonstrates some key attitudes and belief systems towards science and points out many of the obstacles that those of us who try to promote science over pseudoscience, whatever the field, be it vaccines or any other area of quackery or pseudoscience, must address and overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Straw men on flame with logical fallacies (apologies to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_on_Flame_with_Rock_and_Roll"&gt;Blue Öyster Cult&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Obradovic appears to be very incensed about a talk that Alison Singer, President of the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the only truly science-based autism charity in existence at the moment, and she uses a talk by Singer that was lambasted by Generation Rescue big macher J.B. Handley in three parts, as her &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/the-difference-between-you-and-me.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;jumping off point&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am growing increasingly tired of the real reasons there is such controversy regarding vaccines and Autism being misconstrued to make me look pathetic. Alison Singer’s attempted explanation at Yale earlier this month (&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/autism-science-foundations-alison-singer-in-her-own-worlds.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;) is a perfect example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what she suggests, our differences are not due to the internet. They are not due to desperation or the traumatization of having a child with Autism coupled with the need to blame someone. They are not due the media or the anti-establishment-toxic-earth movement. They are not due to the dismissive attitude of society and physicians who for years believed bad parenting was to blame. They are not due to an inability to simply accept clear science. They are not due to lack of an education or ability to think rationally. They are not due to being taken advantage of. They are not due to the cult of celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Sorry. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, all of the above are excellent partial explanations for why parents like Ms. Obradovic refuse to accept science and continue to believe that vaccines cause autism. The reason Ms. Obradovic “looks pathetic” is not because some cabal of scientists are trying to make her look pathetic; it’s because she does an excellent job by herself of making pathetic arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pointed out above, the rest of Ms. Obradovic’s post is structured as nine descriptions of what scientists and those of us who accept the science that doesn’t support her belief that vaccines cause autism believe, and her responding, “I don’t,” followed by a heapin’ helpin’ of what she does believe. Unlike Mark’s post, I’m not going to cover each and every one of these fallacies one by one in detail the way Mark did. I will note that upon rereading the post I just realized that Ms. Obradovic forgot a #3, disobeying the rule regarding the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch: “Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.” Of course, Ms. Obradovic has two straw men #5; so it all evens out to nine straw men again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with straw man #1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. You believe the government (the Department of Health and Human Services) has the legally protected right to research, develop, patent, license, supervise, judge, approve, recommend, mandate, and profit from a product (vaccines) that they produce in partnership with a private entity (the pharmaceutical industry). You further believe they have the right to simultaneously oversee the quality, safety and efficacy of this product, and that they objectively do so. You even further believe that they have the right to fund and conduct studies used to defend their product and policy in a court that they serve as judge and jury over in the event you are harmed by it; and moreover, that if they do find in your favor, they have the right to award you compensation at their discretion using money that was secured by a tax you paid on the product when you purchased it and/or were mandated to use it. And finally, you believe this should be protected by law; that neither the government nor the private entity should be held criminally or financially responsible for negligence in the event it maims or kills you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I mean? Straw man #1 is in reality several straw men prefaced by misrepresentation of Ms. Obradovic’s opinion as fact. The fct is that the government does by law have the power to fund the development of vaccines, purchase them for government-run vaccination programs, and recommend them. Note also how Ms. Obradovic is specifically castigating the federal government (DHHS is a federal, cabinet-level department) when in reality the federal government has relatively little power to mandate vaccines in the civilian sector. (If you don’t believe that, check out how few Americans were vaccinated against H1N1 last year despite a massive government effort to persuade Americans to be vaccinated). It is the state and local governments that set specific vaccine mandates required of children. True, they usually use the recommendations made by the CDC and AAP, but it is not primarily the federal government that “mandates” vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for compensation, Ms. Obradovic is referring to the Vaccine Court. While it is true that the government requires that claims against vaccine manufacturers first be adjudicated through the Vaccine Court, as has been described on this blog and elsewhere, the Vaccine Court is actually a complainant-friendly venue, where the Daubert rule for scientific evidence is usually not enforced and it is not necessary to prove negligence. Moreover, for purposes of the Vaccine Court, there are a set of “&lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/table.htm"&gt;table injuries&lt;/a&gt;,” which are in essence recognized potential complications from vaccines that are automatically compensable. These injuries are simply assumed to have been from vaccines, based on science documenting these as potential complications from vaccines. Also, unlike regular courts, the Vaccine Court will pay attorney’s fees and reasonable expenses even to losing petitioners. A petitioner need only demonstrate that the petition was filed in good faith and that there was a reasonable basis for the claim, the idea being to make it as easy as possible for ordinary citizens to seek compensation for vaccine injuries without incurring huge legal bills or being unable to find a lawyer to represent them on a contingency basis. Indeed, attorneys like &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/149"&gt;Clifford Shoemaker&lt;/a&gt; have made quite the cottage industry of bringing claims before Vaccine Court, knowing that their expenses will be paid, win or lose. Finally, if an action fails in Vaccine Court, the parent is perfectly free to pursue it in the regular courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What straw man #1 reveals is that, like many supporters of pseudoscience and crankery, Ms. Obradovic views science and the government as being arrayed against her, all in cahoots with big pharma. Whatever the short comings and misbehavior of big pharma, some of which I’ve personally documented right here on this very blog, cranks like Ms. Obradovic go far beyond reasonable concerns about big pharma, as we will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to straw man #2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. You believe the only protection the consumer needs to be afforded in the aforementioned situation is trust. People should simply trust that those given such enormous power and protection are honorable, ethical, and responsible human beings with families of their own who would never abuse it or put profit over safety primarily because they are smart, went to prestigious medical institutions, and are at the top of their field. You do trust them. And you trust that there are just too many of them involved to all be bad, somehow making the system safe from corruption based on numbers. This is the one point people rely on to debunk the “conspiracy theorists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, trust is earned. So is respect. I don’t care what letters you have after your name. You’re smart? Great. So am I. I’m not impressed, nor am I intimidated. Smart doesn’t mean ethical. And some of the smartest people I know are also those with the least common sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar? It’s very much the same anti-intellectual attitude that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;J.B. Handley once bragged about&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a hint for Ms. Obradovic. Being “smart” isn’t what matters. “Common sense” isn’t what matters. Understanding and accepting the scientific method and how science works does. Ms. Obradovic honestly seems to believe that the reason the scientific community doesn’t accept her wild beliefs that vaccines cause autism is because of a lack of ethics, plus the government, big pharma, and scientists being all in some grand conspiracy, not because the scientific evidence doesn’t support her belief. Unlike the case for scientists, it never occurs to Ms. Obradovic that she might be wrong or that the reason her belief that vaccines cause autism are not taken seriously by scientists is because, well, she is wrong. But not just wrong, spectacularly and arrogantly wrong about the science. It is the the &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=140"&gt;pure arrogance of ignorance&lt;/a&gt;, born of anti-intellectualism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, I’m not in the least bit impressed by Ms. Obradovic’s trumpeting of her being so “smart.” She has not earned respect in any scientific discussion–quite the contrary. She has proven time and time again that she does not know what she is talking about when it comes to science and that her emotion and distrust of science trump all. Contrary to Ms. Obradovic’s apparent belief that the science behind vaccines is rotten to the core, in actuality it is scientists, not misguided conspiracy mongers like Ms. Obradovic, who point out the shortcomings in the vaccine program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I’ll skip ahead a bit, because it’s a lot more of the same ranting about the government and the scientific community, and it can all be boiled down to straw man #5-1 (given that there are two straw men #5) anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. You believe the science funded and conducted by the DHHS, pharmaceutical companies, vaccine patent holders and government witnesses (there exists no widely accepted study without this level of participation and conflict) thus far on the potential role between vaccines and the onset of Autism Spectrum Disorder and other health outcomes (for which they will be held accountable) is objective and adequate as it stands right now in both quantity and quality to dismiss a link between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not enough space in this article to explain why, but a detailed explanation can be found through the series of articles I wrote here at Age of Autism on the 14 Studies. I’ve read, analyzed and presented every single study multiple times. What you call clear science, I call crap. And no, I’m not willing to accept crap when it comes to my child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, of course, that Ms. Obradovic doesn’t have the background to determine whether a scientific study is “crap” or well-designed, well-executed, and reliable. It is the arrogance of ignorance once again asserting itself. In addition, it is a straw man to claim that we supporters of SBM believe that the science “funded and conducted by the DHHS, pharmaceutical companies, vaccine patent holders and government witnesses” is adequate because there’s so much more than evidence funded by the U.S. government. There’s more to the world than just the United States, you know. There have been many studies not just in the U.S., but in several other countries, including Denmark, Canada, the U.K., Japan, Italy, and elsewhere that have failed to find a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism or between vaccines and autism. Surely all these countries can’t be in on the conspiracy, can they? A much more accurate way of saying this, without the intentional use of the logical fallacy of poisoning the well, is that the totality of the scientific and clinical evidence, when taken as a whole, does not support a link between either thimerosal in vaccines and autism or between vaccines and autism. In contrast, by mentioning the execrable &lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt; website, Ms. Obradovic demonstrates that what she views as “good science” is any science that reinforces her belief, no matter how biased it is or poorly designed and executed, as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=459"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=466"&gt;Mark Crislip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;I have&lt;/a&gt; all demonstrated in our deconstructions of that particularly misinformation-packed Generation Rescue-sponsored propaganda effort. Let’s just put it this way. Anyone who doesn’t easily see through the distortions and misinformation in the Fourteen Studies website has forfeited any claim to an understanding of scientific studies adequate to make grandiose statements about the validity of existing science, such as what Ms. Obradovic makes in straw man #5-2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. You believe everything about Autism is a coincidence: the dramatic rise in incidence; the parallel increase in vaccinations given at the same time; the similarities to mercury poisoning; the ratio of boys to girls; the identification of this new disorder in 1943; the timing of the onset of symptoms; the anecdotal evidence of parents; the original CDC findings; the recovery of children who are treated medically; and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is rooted in observation, and yet, every observation here listed is casually tossed aside as a cosmic lining up of the stars. There is nothing scientific about calling all of this coincidence and explaining it away with unproven excuses (see your list in the second paragraph)…and crap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular straw man demonstrates a misunderstanding of epidemiology so profound as to be beyond belief. In actuality, Ms. Obradovic’s “observations” are nothing more than the blatantly obvious confusing of correlation with causation. As has been pointed out time and time again, mercury poisoning and autism do not resemble each other that strongly. The “dramatic rise” in autism incidence can be largely (although it is unclear if it can be completely) explained by widening of the diagnostic criteria and diagnostic substitution. Also, an example I’ve used before is the Internet. The rise in Internet use beginning in the early 1990s very closely parallels the rise in autism diagnoses and autism prevalence. Surely, by Ms. Obradovic’s logic, the Internet should be just as plausible as a cause of autism as vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s also dead wrong that the hypothesis that vaccines cause autism has been “casually tossed aside” as coincidence. In fact, scientists have studied extensively vaccine safety, looking for a linkage between vaccines and autism, largely driven by the concerns of mothers like Ms. Obradovic. They haven’t found any. In fact, I can retort that one difference between someone like Ms. Obradovic and someone like me is that she doesn’t understand that correlation does not equal causation and that, when science has failed to find a linkage between two things, when that the most likely explanation for any linkage between the two is coincidence. It’s a really hard concept for most people to accept, particularly when they have an emotional investment in a claim of causation, but it’s true. Confusing correlation with causation, confirmation bias, and a number of other cognitive factors conspire to prevent people from easily accepting that sometimes bad things are a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One excellent example came from an &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009953914_apusmedswineflusideeffects.html?syndication=rss"&gt;article about the H1N1 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; using the example of H1N1 vaccination and heart attacks.Given that there are this number of people having heart attacks each and every day, during the months when so many people were being vaccinated against H1N1, it was inevitable that there would be dozens, if not hundreds of coincidences a day in which something bad happens to a person after having the H1N1 vaccine. If you’re one of those people, it will seem all the world as though the vaccine caused the badness to happen. It’s not because these people are stupid or ignorant; it’s because, not knowing the expected rate of these coincidences, most people assume that the rate of coincidence is far lower than it truly is. They assume that the rate is close to zero, that such a coincidence would be rare, but that assumption is wrong when dealing with large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s one difference between Julie Obradovic and me. I understand that. She doesn’t. She thinks herself to be too “smart” ever to make the mistake of mistaking correlation for causation. One of my favorite movie quotes of all times comes from, of all places, a Dirty Harry movie, specifically, Magnum Force. In it, Dirty Harry Callahan says at one point, “A man’s got to know his limitations,” and at another point, “A good man always knows his limitations.” This applies to women as well as men, and Julie Obradovic doesn’t know her limitations with respect to science. From my perspctive, if Obradovic’s world view were more accurate than mine, if big pharma really did have the power to fake research findings all over the world, I’d have to wonder: Why bother to put all those alleged “toxins” in vaccines? Why not use homeopathic vaccines, something harmless but ineffective, and then make up evidence to make it look as though they work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that, in the end, the difference between Ms. Obradovic and someone like me, a supporter of science-based medicine, is that there is evidence that, if produced, would change my mind about whether or not there is a link between vaccines and autism, and I know what that evidence would have to be right now. All it would take would be a couple of well-designed, well-executed, well-analyzed epidemiological studies showing a strong link between vaccines and autism. Produce those, and I would start to reconsider my position. Or, as Tim Minchin put it so brilliantly about homeopathy in his nine minute beat poem &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/01/tim-minchins-storm-now-featured-online/"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; (please be warned that Minchin is fond of the f-word):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science adjusts its beliefs based on what’s observed&lt;br&gt;
Faith is the denial of observation so that Belief can be preserved.&lt;br&gt;
If you show me&lt;br&gt;
That, say, homeopathy works,&lt;br&gt;
Then I will change my mind&lt;br&gt;
I’ll spin on a fucking dime&lt;br&gt;
I’ll be embarrassed as hell,&lt;br&gt;
But I will run through the streets yelling&lt;br&gt;
It’s a miracle! Take physics and bin it!&lt;br&gt;
Water has memory!&lt;br&gt;
And while it’s memory of a long lost drop of onion juice is Infinite&lt;br&gt;
It somehow forgets all the poo it’s had in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You show me that it works and how it works&lt;br&gt;
And when I’ve recovered from the shock&lt;br&gt;
I will take a compass and carve &lt;em&gt;Fancy That!&lt;/em&gt; on the side of my cock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for me and not just homeopathy, but the belief that vaccines cause autism. I’d be embarrassed as hell for having been wrong, and I might resist changing my mind for a while, but eventually science would win out, and I’d realign my beliefs to conform with science. I would, however, abstain from bringing any sharp instruments anywhere near my genitals, and I’m not sure if I’d go running through the streets yelling, “Vaccines cause autism!” I would, however, write about it right here on SBM, minus the use of the f-word. In contrast, there is clearly no evidence that will ever change Ms. Obradovic’s fanatical belief that vaccines cause autism. Just try asking her if you don’t believe me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that remains is: Why do people like Julie Obradovic refuse to accept the science that shows that vaccines are safe and effective and that they are not associated with autism? I’ve already pointed out one reason: Failure to understand that correlation does not equal causation, coupled with failure to let go of a belief that isn’t supported by science. Obviously, though, that alone is not sufficient to explain the intensity of her reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week (or the week after if something comes up that catches my fancy), I’ll consider mechanisms by which we protect irrational beliefs from science.&lt;/p&gt;

He had grown up faith-free and he wasn’t quite prepared when his son asked him whether or not God was real.  If he didn’t give his son a good answer, no doubt there were others ready to give him false ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Andrew respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the basis for his new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583333711?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1583333711"&gt;Between a Church and a Hard Place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  An excerpt from the book is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My son was three years old the first time I heard him say “God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t get it from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristina and I had recently enrolled him in preschool at a Methodist church a short drive from our house. We’d had him in a program three mornings a week at another church near our house, also Methodist — Welcome to the Bible Belt! — until the day I arrived early for pickup and found him on one of the playground benches, curled up as if back in the womb and unable to explain what had caused this despair. The incident, the last in a long string of red flags since a new teacher had arrived that fall, had provided our first experience with the brand of parental guilt that keeps you awake at night, wondering how you turned out to be such an awful person that you would consider outsourcing the rearing of your child for even one second. For a couple of months after that, we kept him home. Eventually, though, we’d had to acknowledge that the boy had taken well to the stimulation and structure preschool offered, and now that we had another child, his mother needed a break from full-time parenting. This new batch of Methodists seemed like good people who would care for him properly. But there was one hitch: Once a week the kids were lined up and led from their classrooms to the sanctuary for a short religious lesson the preschool called “Chapel Chat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my wife and I had for the most part avoided chapels since becoming adults. And the last thing we wanted to do was chat in one. We didn’t belong to any church, and our feelings about organized religion, like our feelings about organized labor and organized crime, were, at best, ambivalent. We found all three were best experienced only as part of Hollywood movies. But that left us in a pickle: So that we could care for my elderly father and be near old friends, we had recently moved back to the midsized North Carolina city in which I had grown up, a place where nine out of ten preschools were run by churches. When touring these facilities, our first question for the director was always whether the children were subjected to any of that, you know, Jesus stuff, and to our surprise, not that many did. I suppose it made sense in a competitive market to stay as secular as possible. But it was midway through the academic year and most of the good programs (and by “good,” I mean ones where you didn’t feel the need to make unannounced visits to make sure your son wasn’t being left to wallow in a puddle of his own misery while the other children were playing on the monkey bars) were already full. Knowing we were lucky to find an opening at this one, we decided to take our chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our relief, our son adapted well to his new environment, and, for the most part, it wasn’t much different from the old one. At this program, instead of having to come inside to pick up our children, we parents lined up in our station wagons and minivans and one by one the kids came running out to greet us. The new routine seemed to make our son feel a bit more grown-up, and as he warmed to his new teachers, we began to feel like we had atoned for the earlier debacle. That is, until that day, when we were reminded of the fragility of parental success, not to mention how uneasy the topic of religion made us both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were sitting on the ell-shaped couch in our den, passing the time in one of the amazing yet quickly forgotten ways that you do when your free hours are given over to bringing up small children, when His name came out of his mouth. Our reaction was approximately the same as if the word had been “antediluvian” or “nanotechnology.” Like most parents, we greeted every new addition to his vocabulary with a glee that would make innocent bystanders gag. But this one came out of nowhere, and I had no idea how to react. I wanted to grab it out of the air and gently shove it back into his mouth for a few more years. The context in which he said it was never clear. It just kind of spilled out, but neither of us had any doubt it was Yahweh’s nickname that had breached his perfect lips. I said nothing, my wide eyes fully expressing my internal alarm. Cristina remained calm, the way you would if a kid was test-driving a bad word picked up at school and you were afraid an overly animated reaction might encourage him to add it to his everyday conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Do you know who God is? she asked him gently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Yes. God makes us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His matter-of-fact response indicated that the answer was so obvious as to be a priori. Cristina glanced at me but decided to ignore the panic now erupting visibly all over my face. She turned back to him and tried probing a bit deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– How does God make us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, he knew the answer, and he delivered it with the confidence that comes with knowing something is the undisputed truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– He screws on our heads and pops in our eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing this, my worry subsided a bit. Whatever he had picked up at preschool was too absurd to be of any harm. In the days to come, I delighted in passing on this adorable little anecdote to friends and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before long, from his crude initial hypothesis, my son began to formulate what is referred to in religious literature as a “Christian worldview.” His mind was made up about the existence of God. And how. But the details still tripped him up. For instance, he wondered why there was a “big X” on the top of churches we passed while driving in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristina and I tried to respond by balancing our own lack of traditional belief with a sincere appreciation for his curiosity. Independently, we each decided that all discourse about matters of faith should be prefaced by the phrase “Well, some people believe…” This seemed like a sensible disclaimer that would help him understand that absolute truth is an elusive thing in the world into which he had been born. But we both knew full well we were just trying to buy some time until we had something more definitive to tell him or at least thought him mature enough to accept our squishiness. We knew that he didn’t care about “some people.” He wanted to know what we, his parents, believed, what to us was true, what to us was real. But we couldn’t tell him. We were as reluctant to say something that would stifle his thought as we were to let him believe everything that the Methodists told him. For a while, as a compromise, we tried substituting “Mother Nature” for God. This, too, struck us as quite sensible: We both loved nature, wanted our children to appreciate and respect it, too, and liked the idea of a little pro-woman affirmative action in the supernatural realm. But ultimately she proved no better than the Man Upstairs. She was a poor proxy, only prompting more questions we couldn’t seem to answer. In actuality, they were the same questions, just with a different omniscient, omnipresent deity making mysterious decisions, like letting a good person do a bad thing or a flower die or one animal savage another for food. We were usually successful in directing the conversation elsewhere, but that tactic only lulled us into thinking we were addressing the issue when we weren’t, making his inevitable inquiries just as startling the next time they came round. If we couldn’t answer even a simple question, someone else certainly would. At this rate, he’d be born-again before he got to kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening after bedtime, I heard soft chatter coming from the room he shared with our daughter, who was one at the time. I continued down the hall, stopping short of the door until I could hear what was being said. The boy, lying awake in his miniature bed, was trying to share some explosive new information with his sister, but she was already asleep in her crib on the opposite side of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Hey, did you know that God made us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused, but there was no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– And when we die, we go back to Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His voice rose expectantly at the end of his question in anticipation of an awestruck response, but once again, none came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Isn’t that so cool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lingered by the door a moment, expecting a return of the panic that had visited me on the couch. But it never showed. In its place, a different feeling arose, something vaguely happy, maybe even hopeful. For a moment, I felt his wonder at the idea of a benevolent creator just waiting to welcome us back into His loving, secure embrace. I understood his comfort at the notion of a grand plan for our existence. When you put it that way, it is so cool. I’ve just never believed it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583333711?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1583333711"&gt;Between a Church and a Hard Place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll see many familiar names including &lt;strong&gt;Greg Epstein&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Paul Kurtz&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Dale McGowan&lt;/strong&gt; — (Andrew even attends a parenting seminar hosted by Dale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested, his publishers have offered to give a couple copies of the book away to readers of this site (woo!) — all you have to do is let us know your answer to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did Andrew handle the situation correctly?  What would you do if you were in his place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two winners will be randomly selected from all commenters on this thread.  Good luck!&lt;br&gt;

The Deepwater Horizon oil rig  is just one example of a piece of technology that is beyond the mastery  of any single person. But there are also nuclear power plants, computer  operating systems, jet airliners, financial systems, operating rooms,  and numerous other examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it seems important, in the months ahead, to not only  focus on mechanical ways to make drilling safer, but also more broadly  on helping people deal with potentially catastrophic complexity. There  must be ways to improve the choice architecture — to help people guard  against risk creep, false security, groupthink, the good-news bias and  all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems reasonable. Certainly we  need to get better at managing  such complexity, by having clear lines of authority and responsibility,  proper risk assessment, and a thorough understanding of group dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

He convincingly argues that using checklists allows for better  communication among individuals engaged in complex tasks, and results  in systematic best practices and avoidance of forgetting details. Don’t  rely on training and human memory, he argues – have a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These  are all excellent and practical ideas. They amount to devising methods  for human beings to optimize their management of increasing complexity.  And these strategies all work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am left with the feeling,  taking the longer view, that they are also stop-gap measures.  Technological complexity will continue to increase, and it seems likely  that complexity will outstrip our desperate attempts to manage it by  modifying human behavior. Even if we become experts at mastering  complexity, there are practical limits to what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  also relates to the notion of interdependency. As technology advances,  people have to specialize on narrower and narrower slices of that  technology. It used to be that craftsmen would construct an entire house  – from foundation to finishing. Now a contractor will contract out to  dozens of specialists who build one part of the house – an architect, a  site engineer, foundation layer, a framer, a roofer, a plumber,  electrician, drywall, painter, finishing carpenter, well driller,  landscaper, and perhaps even a decorator. You would be hard pressed to  find a single crew that can build an entire house anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine  is another example – we still need generalists, but more and more they  are becoming like contractors – guiding the overall management of  health, but farming out to specialists the management of specific  diseases and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution that we are increasingly  turning to is computers. We are automating those checklists, using  computers to communicate among specialists, and expert systems to guide  specialists. Computer programs are increasingly involved in design and  engineering,  risk management, and even the writing of other computer  programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As end users we are becoming increasingly comfortable  relying upon computers for our needs. The GPS is the perfect example of  this. Rather than consulting a map, learning the roads, and planning a  route – you simply plug in your destination and mindlessly follow  turn-by-turn directions. They are wonderful devices, extremely useful,  and that is part of my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are already evolving past  useful to indispensable. The question is – are they tools to make us  more productive and free us from drudgery so that we can engage in more  creative endeavors? Or are they making us lazy and dependent by coddling  us? Perhaps a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extreme vision of a  dystopian future run by computer nannies is Wally. On board the ship  that carries the remnants of humanity, people float around on recliners,  endlessly engrossed in video entertainment, while the ship’s systems  see to their every need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not predicting such a future, nor  am I advocating that we simply extrapolate from current trends to their  absurd conclusion. But it is an interesting thought experiment – what  will ultimately happen as our civilization becomes more and more  complicated, and we need to rely more and more on computers? Some think  we will merge with computers – we will become them, and will be able to  expand our own mental abilities as needed. Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may also  reach an equilibrium, at least for a while, between relying on computers  and using computers to enhance our own abilities and productivity. We  may also see subcultures in which every permutation plays itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We  also should not assume that as technology progresses complexity will  necessarily increase as well. We may pass through a technological era of  maximal complexity, but as our knowledge and technological prowess  progress complexity will be replaced by elegant simplicity. Think of the  elaborate systems that were in place to, say, publish a magazine, that  have now all been replaced by the relative simplicity of desktop  publishing. Perhaps technology brings an ebb and flow of complexity,  rather than a continuous increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seems that humans will,  to some extent, titrate their own complexity. As technology makes our  lives simpler, we find new things to do that add complexity – to the  limit of our tolerance, then we search for ways to simplify again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All  of these factors make predicting the future of technology and  complexity extremely difficult.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientists say an Aboriginal rock art depiction of an extinct giant bird could be Australia's oldest painting.

&lt;p&gt;The red ochre painting, which depicts two emu-like birds with their necks outstretched, could date back to the earliest days of settlement on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was rediscovered at the centre of the Arnhem Land plateau about two years ago, but archaeologists first visited the site a fortnight ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A palaeontologist has confirmed the animals depicted are the megafauna species Genyornis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologist Ben Gunn said the giant birds became extinct more than 40,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As could be expected, studies that monitor phthalate metabolites in human populations have shown that they are widely present. Over the years, there have been many concerns over their effect on human health notably as hormonal disrupting agents. This has led to the regulation of some phthalates in consumer products in Europe and the United States, which in some cases,have been replaced with others. Recent evidences indicate that endocrine disruption might only be a tip of the iceberg and that pthalates might have other health effects as well.It is well known that maternal exposure of pollutants make their way to the offspring and in many cases can have deleterious consequences. It appears that this dogma can also be applied to the case of the pthalates. In a study by Engel et al published in Environmental health perspectives,http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action;jsessionid=E899A81379071E8E095EF53E962F597F?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1289%2Fehp.0901470the authors questioned whether there was any association between prenatal phthalate exposure to the behavior of offspring. The study occurred in a multiethnic prenatal population enrolled in the Mount Sinai Children’s Environmental Health Study in New York City between 1998 and 2002. Urine samples of mothers during the third-trimester of pregnancy was collected and analyzed for phthalate metabolites. Subsequently, cognitive and behavioral development of the children was assessed between the ages of 4 and 9. Interestingly, the scientists found that increased concentrations of low-molecular-weight (LMW) phthalate metabolites in the mothers were associated with poorer scores on aggression, conduct problems, attention problems, and depression in the children. These results led them to conclude that behavioral domains adversely associated with prenatal exposure to LMW phthalates in this study are commonly affected in children clinically diagnosed with conduct or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.This study and several of its predecessors, extend the known adverse effects of pthalates, which calls for increased caution. What is urgently needed are more hard core studies elucidating the toxicology of pthalates and their metabolites, that will help us understand the consequences of exposure. However, these studies will take time; the evidence at hand should motivate nations to re-evaluate their policies on pthalates and enforce strict regulations.Pthalates are esters of pthalic acid that are commonly added to plastics but also are found in diverse products ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceutical pills.

Long before the colonizers arrived in South America, indigenous farmers, belonging to the Arauquinoid cultures, had already interfered with the Amazonian biodiversity. Their novel agricultural engineering methods had changed the savannah ecosystem, resulting in increased biodiversity. Thus states the solid paper, on &amp;#39;Pre-Columbian agricultural landscapes, ecosystem engineers, and self-organized patchiness in Amazonia&amp;#39;, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (online before print, April 12th 2010), by Doyle McKey (Université de Montpellier II, France), Stéphen Rostain, José Iriarte, Bruno Glaser, Jago Jonathan Birk, Irene Holst, and Delphine Renard. The savannahs of coastal Guyana tend to flood during the rains and are dry during the summer. However, strange complexes of mounds are seen in the terrain of these plains, running for 360 miles from Berbice River to Cayenne. Due to their perfect symmetry, the mounds were deduced to be man-made. The mounds drained well during the rains and floods (their drainage capacity was nine times as high as the seasonally flooded savannah). The authors deduce that these are large raised beds/fields, made out of the surrounding topsoil, for cultivating crops (a theory further substantiated by soil samples containing microfossils of maize, cassava, and squash), constructed by the pre-Columbian farmers, around 1000-700 years ago. The interesting point is that this farming was practiced in wastelands considered to be unsuitable for agriculture- a feat achieved due to their effective agricultural engineering. When these fields were abandoned, the mounds were colonised by flora and fauna, thus creating a new ecosystem. These &amp;#39;ecosystem engineers&amp;#39; (viz., ants such as Acromyrmex octospinosus and Ectatomma brunneum, termites such as Nasutitermitinae, and earthworms) built their nests on the raised beds so that the colonies wouldn&amp;#39;t be flooded. Their burrowing aerated it further, helping in accumulating sufficient rainfall. Moreover, the mounds were fertilised as a result of them congregating organic matter into their nests and accumulating minerals such as nitrogen, potassium, and calcium. As a result, the perennial plants on the mounds flourished and their strong roots prevented the erosion of the mound. All of these alterations initiated by humans have resulted in a higher biodiversity than seen in the normal savannahs. This study would give additional impetus to the debate over whether most of the Amazon rainforest and savannahs (commonly considered to be pristine) are sites of significant human occupation, especially during the pre-Columbian times. The authors suggest that this agricultural system could be a model for modern farming, especially considering the beneficial ecological changes. Although this is a perfect example of a terrain modified by humans and maintained by Nature, it must be noted the increase in biodiversity was a result of 400-800 years of no/minimal human intervention. Secondly, the ‘punja’ technique of rice/paddy cultivation has a very similar methodology and is followed in parts of Kerala. link: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/04/07/0908925107.abstract?sid=93317154-3ce6-43c8-9a1e-456e24272c2bMcKey D, Rostain S, Iriarte J, Glaser B, Birk JJ, Holst I, &amp;amp; Renard D (2010).

A slick is not going to slow down a storm, but a storm could fling a slick everywhere. Of course, it all depends on the particular path of the storm, etc.

Granted, the story becomes more pressing now because of the failure of the "top kill" method of plugging the well. We're on to Plan C now, followed by Plan D, but if they all fail then the relief wells won't be finished (allegedly) til August. That's right when the serious part of hurricane season begins--although, again, if we're in for a mega year like 2005, then you can have an early forming Category 4 (like Dennis) in July.

I'm trying to find the bright side in all of this...but I'm really not seeing it.

Below, incidentally, is the track of Dennis in 2005. A storm along such a path might actually push oil away from land, given that it would be approaching the nearshore part of slick from the southeast. In this scenario, the winds over the bulk of the slick would (I believe, just by eyeballing it) be blowing back out to sea.

What's really cool about this paper (to Sci, anyway), is that it brings two different areas that she's been interested in into one cool glob of SCIENCE.  And it helps to explain many of the questions that Sci got in response to two of the papers she has blogged about recently.

They are these:

1) The Incredible Healing Mouse: Bedelbeava et al. "Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice" Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences, 2010.

2) The neurogenesis theory of depression and a little guy called CREB: Gur et al. "cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein Deficiency Allows for Increased Neurogenesis and a Rapid Onset of Antidepressant Response" The Journal of Neuroscience, 2007.

And NOW, behold their MUTANT OFFSPRING:

 Pechnick et al. "p21 restricts neuronal proliferation in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus"  PNAS, 2008.

Well ok, technically it isn't a mutant offspring, because this paper was BEFORE the first paper and after the second.  So I guess it's a stepchild.  Or a sibling.  Or just the results of how Sci was searching PubMed that day.

Anyway.

Newmana, Ted Supallab, Peter Hauserc, Elissa L. Newportb, and Daphne Bavelier), reports the investigation of differential brain region usage in interpreting two different types of language:  inflected and positional.In inflected language, a word&amp;#39;s relationship to the rest of the sentence is determined (communicated) through case markers such as inflections (I&amp;#39;m including agglutinating languages in this class).  For instance, the subject of a sentence or clause is identified by different inflection (such as case endings) from the object of a verb or preposition.  By contrast, in a positional language (or construction within a language) this information is communicated by its position in the sentence, clause, or phrase.What Newmana et al. have shown is that different regions of the brain are activated when a hearer (seer, actually, in this case since they studied American Sign Language) encounters phrases or clauses determined by inflection vs. word order: To summarize, we exploited a property of American Sign Language, unique among languages thus far studied with neuroimaging, to directly compare the neural systems involved in sentence processing when grammatical information was conveyed through word order as opposed to inflectional morphology.  Critically, this comparison was made within subjects, while tightly controlling syntactic complexity and semantic content.  Reliance on word order (serial position) cues for resolving grammatical dependencies activated a network of areas related to serial working memory.  In contrast, the presence of inflectional morphology increased activation in a broadly distributed bilateral network featuring the inferior frontal gyri, the anterior lateral temporal lobes, and the basal ganglia, which have been implicated in building and analyzing grammatical structure.  These dissociations are in accord with models of language organization in the brain that attribute specific grammatical functions to distinct neural subregions, but are most consistent with those models that attribute these mapping specificities to the particular cognitive resources required to process various types of linguistic cues.[1] The Proposed TheoryNow my theory is that the final stage in the evolution of our language skills involve these inflected (and agglutinating) constructions.  Several facts point to this sequence.... (read the rest in the full post)The simplest form of language is the pidgin, a &amp;quot;simplified language that develops as a means of communication between two or more groups that do not have a language in common&amp;quot;.  In its simplest form a pidgin might consist of 2-3 word sentences containing a noun and a verb, with perhaps another noun representing the object of the verb.A common theory is that many such pidgins develop naturally into creoles, which are usually typified by a lack of inflectional morphology (other than at most two or three inflectional affixes),a lack of tone on monosyllabic words, anda lack of semantically opaque word formation. (Some exceptions to this standard have been noted.)  This process might take as little as one generation, leading to the widely accepted hypothesis that children come with &amp;quot;hard-wired&amp;quot; expectations of certain features in a language, and, in essence, they look for them hard enough to find them in their parents&amp;#39; pidgin even though it wasn&amp;#39;t really there.[5] [A1]  What I would suggest is that entirely positional languages of this type represented the previous stage of language evolution, with the development of case marking, agreement, and flexible word order as the final evolutionary step.For any proposed evolutionary step, a selective value must be identified.  In this case, I would propose that, very simply, flexible word order enables substantially improved epic poetry,[2] [3] which in turn enables multi-generational transmission of essential myths, which in their turn can encode selectively valuable historical information.[4] [7]I&amp;#39;m going to defer discussion of the adaptive value of myths, and even epic, for a moment while we take a look at how languages evolve in the presence of writing.  Although the earlier forms of a language or protolanguage can be inferred from a study of its current structure, most of our information regarding linguistic development comes from written records of some sort, which means that the culture involved had some contact with writing.Now if writing can carry information across long time periods, it can to some extent replace epic poetry and myth, reducing the need for full flexibility of word order.  This being the case, we should expect the languages of cultures using writing (or in close contact with other cultures that use writing) to show a trend of replacing fully flexible word order constructions with more word-order dependent constructions.  And so it is, especially in that most-studied of language groups, Indo-European (&amp;quot;IE&amp;quot;):  It has long been noticed that there are trends in language change, such that certain types of development occur often and in unrelated languages.  For instance, English is one of many languages that have formed future markers from a verb of motion.  The development of Indo-European adverbial particles to adpositions, apparently independently in its daughter languages, results from reanalysis of underlying structures and is a very early development of configurational syntax in the language family.[2] Thus, we can see a general trend from case-marked (inflected) constructions to systems dependent on word order.  In English this process has been carried almost to completion.  We must note here that the only languages we know about in this group are those of cultures that had, or were in close contact with somebody else who had, writing.  I would predict that any IE languages that remained completely isolated from writing likely retained the fully flexible constructions of the parent language, although until we find them in contact with somebody capable of writing down reasonably large amounts of them we wouldn&amp;#39;t know about them, and at that time we would find them already evolving towards more positional constructions.Since the work of Lord and Parry, it&amp;#39;s been recognized (with some debate) that the epic in its original entirely oral form was composed &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot; for a specific performance.[A2]  The actual basic story might stay the same, but each performance was a unique, one-time, composition made up of &amp;quot;formulas&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a formula being &amp;#39;an expression which is regularly used, under the same metrical conditions, to express a particular essential idea&amp;#39;[3]&amp;quot;.  The language of epic was thus not an actual spoken dialect but a conventionalised form that developed in a manner typical of orally transmitted poetry and later became a prestigious literary variety....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The “Courtyard of the Gentiles”, as the foundation is known, is being set up by the Pontifical Council for Culture, the influential Vatican department that is charged with fostering better relations with non-Catholics. It was founded by Pope John Paul II in 1982 to spearhead his attempts to create a better dialogue with other cultures and faith, including those with no religion at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t you love to see &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/strong&gt; in a debate against the best the Catholic Church has to offer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Pay-per-view right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just one catch…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominent atheists won’t be allowed to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… In an interview with the National Catholic Register, Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi, the president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, made it clear he would not be willing to give a platform to certain prominent atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The foundation, he said, would only be interested in “noble atheism or agnosticism, not the polemical kind -– so not those atheists such as [Piergiorgio] Odifreddi in Italy, [Michel] Onfray in France, [Christopher] Hitchens and [Richard] Dawkins”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such atheists, he added, only view the truth with “irony and sarcasm” and tend to “read religious texts like fundamentalists”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the atheists who make a living out of pointing out the flaws of religion and the church… the ones who debate for a living… they can’t do this because the Catholic representatives would be humiliated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who are allowed to battle their “top theologians” are atheists who have never treated religion with contempt or sarcasm, and who have never read the Bible as if it was to be taken literally (as most Christians do). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrows the field down to… *scratches head*….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if you’re trying to reach out to atheists, then go all the way.  Don’t say you’re open to dialogue… except with people who already criticize you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never hear a seasoned debater like &lt;strong&gt;Dan Barker&lt;/strong&gt; say he won’t go up against particular Christians.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have stronger arguments, it doesn’t matter who your opponents are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes you wonder what the Catholic Church is afraid of.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Isis and the Isis family have a 13 year old Jack Russell Terrier.  He came to live with us after we agreed to take him in for 6 months while his original owner found a new place to live.  We've since had him for about 7 years.  In the last several months he has become un-housetrained and is developing cataracts.  Then a few weeks ago he snarled and snapped at Little Isis.  Yesterday, he bit at him.  He didn't wound him, but he did make contact with his little foot.  Damn it, damn it, damn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way this is is going to end well for everyone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="crying child.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/crying%20child.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="273" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.poontater.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/sad-face04.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: I am afraid that, no matter what, it is going to end like this.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I might as well answer an email.  Mama needs a little flattery...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Dr. Isis,

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First off, I would like to sincerely thank you for your openness, honesty, and hilarity on your blog. When I got pregnant last year as a 'finished with fieldwork and just started analysis and writing Ph.D. candidate', I relied heavily on your blog as a source of positive female mentoring, especially during late night freakouts when I worried I was totally nuts to think of having a kid before defending. Or when people point-blank asked if my pregnancy was a "mistake" since I hadn't finished my degree yet. If at all possible, I am an even more avid reader now that I have my own little one and am working to balance personal and professional commitments. So thanks for all of your hard work, and finding time to do some "personal" outreach in your busy schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was wondering if you could comment on a mentoring issue. My advisor is relatively young, just made tenure, and except for his experience here, I don't think he has mentored before. He's been pretty good so far, but I have added lots of things to my "don't EVER do when I finally become a mentor" list. Just yesterday I heard from an undergraduate student that I have been mentoring for the past 2 years. She is incredibly hard working and was awarded a prestigious summer position that she was really excited about. Unfortunately, she just sent me an email yesterday that she had a family tragedy and had decided to stay at home this summer instead of taking the research position. She didn't provide any details, but just based on her level of excitement about the position, it must have been something really earth shattering for her to decide to stay home. I left her a message soon after to express my condolences and to let her know that I understood her decision. Our advisor just sent her an email this morning (CC'd to me) expressing his disappointment and asking her to reconsider her decision. My knee-jerk reaction is that it sounded condescending and patronizing, as if she couldn't rationally weigh the costs/benefits of choosing to stay at home vs. take a prestigious summer job. It's hard to get subtle tones from an email message, but he has reacted similarly to sudden game-changing decisions of his other students in the past, including me. He seems more apt to jump to conclusions about the student's commitment to science and their ability to function in academia, even (especially) when he doesn't know all the details that went into the making of those decisions. I suspect that there may be some cultural issues at play here too, where our advisor might not feel the same responsibilities towards extended family as my friend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have any advice on how to mentor students through personal tragedies? Is it ever appropriate to ask for more details about a student's personal life and the factors that went into making such a difficult decision? When cultural attitudes towards family differ between mentor and mentee, how can the mentor respond in a cultually-sensitive way to decisions that may be weighted much differently than they themselves would prioritize their actions? And when the decision is last minute, and the tragedy still fresh, is there any way to tactfully discuss the pros and cons of a deeply personal decision? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you so much again for sharing your thoughts with the wider world. Any advice you may have on this issue (or pretty much any other!) is very much appreciated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
[Future Awesome Mentor]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy, oh boy, oh boy.  Where to being...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mentoring is a funny thing.  I don&amp;#39;t think anyone is ever formally trained to mentor someone.  Some of us have the opportunity to informally mentor more junior scientists as graduate students and postdocs and I think that we learn to be mentors as a product of how we were mentored and our experience mentoring others.  There are people that have mentored for a fucktillion years and still suck at it and there are people that are relatively new mentors and are largely successful.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I am finding funny in my own career is looking back at my experiences with my graduate school mentor.  I can remember being angry at him so many times.  I once stormed back to the lab after he refused to help me fix a piece of equipment, slammed the door, and yelled to my labmate, &amp;quot;I wish he would just go take a leap off his own ass!&amp;quot;   Now, I find myself doing some of the exact same things.  Things that used to infuriate me and that I swore I would never do.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, sometimes &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; mentors are good because they are matched with someone who is a good fit.  One particular mentor might not be right for everyone for every purpose.  This is why I think it&amp;#39;s important to have several mentors - both formal and informal.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I have been open about leaving school when I was an undergraduate [I know in some other post I discussed this.  Damned if I can find it],  I&amp;#39;ve never had a student experience a tragedy that caused them to leave school.  When I left school, it was challenging to come back.  It was challenging to motivate myself to return and it was challenging to convince others that I deserved a second chance.  It doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s impossible.  It just means that it is challenging.  That challenge can pose a substantial barrier to some and might cause them to not return at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other day I was having a conversation with a colleague of mine about someone I have started collaborating with.  He is a non-tenure track PhD-level scientist who is extremely brilliant.  I asked my colleague why this scientist had never entered a tenure track position.  He commented that this scientist chose to stay at MRU after he finished his PhD and began work as a scientist.  In the last few years he had applied for a tenure track job, but did not have a sufficiently competitive application compared to individuals who had stayed on a more traditional path.  He then said, &amp;quot;Sometimes leaving a traditional career path can really hurt your future ability to get on the tenure track.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what about a student who experiences a tragedy and decides to either leave school or give up an opportunity?  It is inappropriate to ask a student for details about her personal life, but it&amp;#39;s not inappropriate to be available or to try to offer resources to help them balance family and academic responsibilities.  I also think it is appropriate to be honest about the consequences of particular decisions and to be open to helping a student weigh the pros and cons of a decision.  I know that I did not have the appropriate reference points to weigh the cost and benefit of my own decision to leave school(even though I thought I did) and I think that a responsible mentor has a duty to be sure that the person she mentors understands all of her options.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may frequently be cultural differences between a mentor and her trainee.  I come from a culture that places a very high value on family, and staying close to one&amp;#39;s hometown, especially for women.  Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the culture of academia and, while I hope that we can continue to work to change the culture of academia, it is implausible that a single undergraduate student is going to do it.  At the end of the day  this student has to make the best, fully informed decision that is best for her, understanding the ramifications of her decision.  Sometimes women who leave academic opportunities to care for family are looked down upon and, more frequently than their male colleagues, women are asked to leave careers and school, to care for family. I know some male scientists who are concerned about giving women opportunities because they are afraid that these women will leave academia. But, maybe there will be no consequences.  Could be that this student will return in the fall on the same path to success she was on.   Maybe this letter writer&amp;#39;s mentor is concerned that this student will not continue on a path toward graduate school.  It&amp;#39;s hard to say without really understanding the dynamics between these parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of luck to this student and congratulations to the letter writer for being an available mentor to her.  Sometimes all you can do in these situations is hope that everything works out for the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/ask_dr_isis_-_mentoring_throug.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/ask_dr_isis_-_mentoring_throug.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/oxbyH9cis7Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275258601611"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=2818">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d1aa411db1239fa0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Acupuncture Works, Say Scientists</title><published>2010-05-30T19:02:55Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T19:02:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/acupuncture-works-say-scientists/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Media response to new study on acupuncture in mice.&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=jdc325.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=1781036&amp;amp;post=2818&amp;amp;subd=jdc325&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>jdc325</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275258409631"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_constructive_suggestion_for.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b2cb788b10b3e97</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">A constructive suggestion for retribution against BP</title><published>2010-05-30T20:49:06Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T20:49:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/xxwnnyWIhz4/a_constructive_suggestion_for.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_constructive_suggestion_for.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Look at this: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/us/30rig.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;BP knew about problems at that burning oil rig &lt;i&gt;11 months ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They screwed up with bad decisions in the short interval immediately before the explosion, but documents have come to light showing that they were worried about &amp;quot;loss of control&amp;quot; months before the disaster — and what they did in response was to ask for delays in testing (which they got), and then they fudged the tests by using a lower pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is basically criminal misconduct. But hey, what's the point of getting upset over 11 deaths and a mere environmental catastrophe? We need the oil. Let's just help the oil companies get beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;a href="http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/06mexico/background/oil/media/platform_600.html"&gt;map of the approximately 4000 oil rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/05/a_constructive_suggestion_for/oilrigs.jpeg" width="400" height="266" alt="oilrigs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is fixated on that one burning mess in the Gulf, which is probably exactly what the oil companies want — they are probably sweating pungent carcinogenic petrochemicals at the thought that someone might look around and notice all of those other rigs, which almost certainly have a paper trail of shortcuts and risks and shoddy management. While BP is struggling to catch up with its responsibilities and close off the well and clean up the poisons, I think a great thing for the Obama administration to do would be to descend on each of those other wells with a force of elite regulatory accountants, documenting all the potential and extant problems, and telling each company to fix them. Now. Without cheating, without getting any special dispensations. If they can&amp;#39;t fix them, shut them down or hit them with massive penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a very low opinion of oil company executives. I doubt that they have any sincere regrets about the loss of life or the destruction of the environment. But having to fix every place where they shaved corners, and pay out money to bring everything up to legally mandated standards — now &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; will make them cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Here's &lt;a href="http://intelligencepress.com/features/bakerhughes/"&gt;another site with a count of US oil and gas rigs&lt;/a&gt; — it says there are about 1500. I can&amp;#39;t account for the discrepancy, unless there has been a rapid decline in the last few years (this site is more current), or there is some other criterion for inclusion in this particular list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter, of course — except that a smaller number makes it easier to review them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_constructive_suggestion_for.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xxwnnyWIhz4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275258392339"><id gr:original-id="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/talking-pain-seeking-validation-social-interaction-in-pain/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba4fb204e708db7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Talking pain – seeking validation: Social interaction in pain</title><published>2010-05-30T15:43:12Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T15:43:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/vNuSFHLzNeY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/talking-pain-seeking-validation-social-interaction-in-pain/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">While we might laugh about the so-called typical ‘I will fix it’ response of some men when their partners talk about problems (when what the woman really wants is a hug), it seems that much of our research into pain behaviour, particularly verbal expressions of pain, has missed something.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;…to conduct research on fundamental evolutionary dynamics in both natural and artificial systems, educate a generation of multi-disciplinary scientists in these methods, and improve public understanding of evolution at all levels. The center will unite biologists who study natural evolutionary processes with computer scientists and engineers who are harnessing these processes to solve real-world problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the researchers associated with the consortium is Joe Felsenstein, who guest posts here on occasion.  On a fast run-through of &lt;a href="http://www.beacon.msu.edu/new_people.php" rel="external "&gt;the personnel listing&lt;/a&gt; I also see at least four senior people who have been associated with the &lt;em&gt;AVIDA&lt;/em&gt; project at Michigan State (Pennock, Lenski, Ofria, and Wilke) and other leaders in both evolutionary biology and computer modeling of evolution.  The consortium includes Michigan State University (lead institution), along with the University of Washington, the University of Texas at Austin, North Carolina A&amp;amp;T, and the University of Idaho.  I’ll be interested to see what comes out of it, especially given &lt;a href="http://www.beacon.msu.edu/summary.html" rel="external "&gt;its lofty goals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEACON will have a powerful legacy: we will reframe public perceptions of evolution and increase understanding of scientific methods. At the same time, we will produce a conceptual framework to firmly establish evolutionary biology as an experimental science and cement its links to computing in a crossfertilization that enhances both fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href="http://www.beacon.msu.edu/education.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K-12 and general public education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this area, BEACON will pursue four main goals:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    * Demonstrate the fundamental power and importance of evolution. BEACON will contribute to the pressing national need to bolster U.S. pre-eminence in science and technology by educating people about the importance of understanding, managing and harnessing biological and computational evolutionary processes and deconstructing the false dichotomy of micro- versus macro-evolution.&lt;br&gt;
    * Disseminating materials generated by BEACON. Our team includes experts in science education and outreach who will work with all BEACON researchers to adapt BEACON research for use in science classes in schools in ways that address national science standards and goals.&lt;br&gt;
    * Increasing participation in science and engineering. We will broaden participation in STEM disciplines by introducing teachers and students from underrepresented groups to the new research opportunities afforded by BEACON’s applied evolutionary tools and research programs.&lt;br&gt;
    * Preparing responsible citizens. We will deepen student’s understanding of evolution-related challenges, such as responding to the evolution of infectious diseases and limiting the evolution of antibiotic and pesticide resistance, and have them learn to protect the integrity of the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are high aspirations.

&lt;p&gt;“I want to lift up religious humanism as an alternative to (religious) orthodoxy,” said Butts, who isn’t sure if God exists and doesn’t take the Bible literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious humanists contend that belief in deities and a spiritual realm are not needed to motivate people to make the world a better place. Yet there are aspects of religion, such as its communalism and use of rites and rituals, that they uphold.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious humanism is still too touchy-feely for my tastes, but I know there are a lot of atheists who still feel culturally tied to their former faiths who might see this religious humanism as a helpful stepping stone away from actual religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you in that camp, this may be a great series of talks for you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You often will hear people say, I feel ‘blessed’ for having certain things in my life and they often times attribute these blessings to the work of a supernatural god or the will of some grand universal energy source. I don’t think you need any magic to find that sense of wonder. It is all around you if you look for it. It is in science and nature and it is in the minds of people standing right next to you at the grocery store or maybe even at Best Buy. With that idea in mind I bring you another edition of, &lt;em&gt;The Skeptic Next Door&lt;/em&gt;. Allow me to introduce the entertaining and inspiring, Mr. Jarret Kaufman.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/3614/jarrettsmall.jpg" alt="Jarrett Kaufman" width="320" height="213"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click below to read the interview and to learn about Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Deity, Diego Rivera and more!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.What do you do for a living? What do you do for fun?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interesting that you posed those questions together, as the two have sort of flipped in the last five years or so. I spent the majority of my life (since the age of four) as a professional actor, working in a pretty wide range of commercials, television series, films, and voiceovers and doing relatively well for myself. As I got older I reached the transition age (kid/teenager to adult roles), which is already a make-or-break time for any career, but mine hit alongside the huge Screen Actors Guild strike, the big surge of reality television cutting down on time slots for scripted television, and the shift of a lot of the filming and casting to places like Canada. It was bad, I had more than just myself to support, and I started taking more regular non-acting work. My last professional job (Entourage) was in 2005, and I had to focus on a “real” job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I swapped my computer hobby into my career and started working in IT. It was initially side work, but I eventually went professional and now I do outsourced network and computer support for small to medium sized businesses. It puts me in a wide variety of environments, from one-person offices to major companies. Right now I’m doing part-time work at Current TV, which is a truly fantastic experience, as the people genuinely kind and creative and treat me with a lot of respect. And I think it’s the last stop for true journalism on television. Anyway, the work feeds my interest in technology and also provides an outlet for it. All that said, I’d go back to acting without skipping a beat if it could support me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What first got you interested in skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I know it’s cliched to say it now, but I was arguably always one, even if I didn’t realize it. I was the kid who hit Reply All on the e-mail forwards and pointed out all the logical flaws in the message to the entire group. Snopes was my playground. And learning the truth behind things we took for granted was a lot of fun. Made me feel like I knew something nobody else did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably my first obvious notice of “real” skepticism was &lt;a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/home.do"&gt;Penn &amp;amp; Teller: Bullshit&lt;/a&gt; on Showtime. I found the show one day, and as a fan of Penn &lt;img src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/1150/jarrett3small.jpg" alt="jarrett" width="320" height="213"&gt;&amp;amp; Teller (I had the fortune of working with Penn on an episode of Lois &amp;amp; Clark as a kid) I knew I had to watch it. And right off the bat I was amazed by the topics they covered. Some were obvious, like psychics, but taken from perspectives I hadn’t considered at the time. Others hit closer to home, making me question some of the pre-conceived notions I had about things like alternative medicine (something I had been raised with and accepted as fact). But the more I looked at the thinking process, the more I realized how important it was that I let go of assumptions and be willing to accept when something I was happy to believe is actually wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until a few years ago when I got my Zune for my birthday (seriously, I love my Zune, so no snide remarks!) that I paid any attention to podcasts. I’d heard of them, but had only a vague idea of the concept. The Zune made finding and accessing podcasts really easy, and the first things I looked for were sci-fi podcasts and science podcasts. And right at the top of the science section was the &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;Skeptics Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt;. This is where having heard the word “skeptic” on Bullshit came in handy, and I was immediately interested and subscribed. I was definitely hooked right away by the engaging and well-rounded Rogues, recognized names and concepts from Bullshit, and I quickly made it a regular show I listened to. I very slowly branched out to other podcasts (&lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/"&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com/"&gt;Skepticality&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org/"&gt;For Good Reason&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/"&gt;Point of Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, among others), and started subscribing to blogs and really paid attention to the whole deal, figuring out that it was exactly what I was supposed to be involved in. Then Rebecca Watson spent what seemed like half an episode talking about Twitter which finally talked me into giving it a fair go, and that was the extra boost I needed to start feeling like I was personally connected, since I could now directly interact with the people I knew about in a non-invasive and open way. That changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You told me that you were first introduced to atheist concepts by your grandfather who was friends with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Rivera"&gt;Diego Rivera&lt;/a&gt;. Could you explain that relationship and how it was influential to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I was always an atheist, as my mother was, so I had no real concept of belief. My maternal grandfather, Joe Kaufman, was also an atheist, and I can only assume that’s where my mother’s lack of belief originated as well. But more than just the atheism, he’s probably the reason I was innately skeptical to begin with. He never took anything for granted, and was always the type to write letters to the editor &lt;img src="http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/8240/jarrett2small.jpg" alt="Jarrett" width="213" height="320"&gt;(and get personal responses back), correcting mistakes and injustice whenever and wherever he could. He was an activist, but the type who used words and civility as his weapons, and he wielded them deftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also, back in the day, an unashamed socialist and he and my grandmother helped found the &lt;a href="http://www.aflcio.org/"&gt;AFL-CIO&lt;/a&gt;. He used to attend labor meetings with Diego Rivera, meeting with him and others while the famous Rockefeller Center mural was being painted. He was personal friends with Rivera and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo"&gt;Frida Kahlo&lt;/a&gt;, and if I’m not mistaken my mother still has a copper bracelet he made for my grandmother. It’s quite a legacy and one I’m very proud of. Regardless of where things have gone and one’s own politics (even my own, which aren’t necessarily the same), it’s one of the reasons a small shudder goes through me whenever the word “socialist” is used as an epithet. They were working hard to help people via the means they felt were their best option at the time to protect them from those who would take advantage. Arguably one of the very goals we strive for as a movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid he made it clear to me that one of the most important phrases I could ever live by was “how do you know?” He warned me that I risked as a kid sounding “fresh” if I asked it of my elders, but I always needed to keep it in mind when evaluating anything I was told. It didn’t mean as much to me as a kid, but as I grew up I paid more attention to it, and that’s the foundation I built off of once I found my way to skepticism, realizing this was exactly what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You work on the widely popular, &lt;a href="http://www.mrdeity.com/"&gt;Mr. Deity Show&lt;/a&gt;. Could you tell us a little bit about the show, how you got involved and what specifically you do on the show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mr. Deity, for those who don’t know, is a satirical web series about the creator of the universe. He’s essentially Yahweh (occasionally referred to as “El” in the show, short for Elohim), but a self-centered, inept, downright childish version, and pretty much one of the few possible ways this type of god could actually make sense given the world in which we live. Brian Dalton, the creator, writer, and actor who plays Mr. Deity can and should tell the story better of how he created the show, but in short it was the Sri Lankan tsunami that got him trying to figure out what kind of god was okay with a disaster like that. Anyway, the show is deeply, deeply witty, and the majority of the series takes a direct look at genuine absurdity throughout the bible or religion in general, poking fun at it in clever ways (although some episodes are just funny for the sake of funny, without necessarily making a point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got involved by pure luck. I was a fan of the show ever since I found it on StumbleUpon, and then one day I stumbled upon Brian himself in a Best Buy. It’s not every day you turn around and find God standing in the printer aisle. I quickly went up to him and did my best not to terrify him by going all fanboy, but he was quite nice and receptive and we communicated via e-mail for a while before my acting background came up, he checked out my work, and cast me in the show. Quite literally a dream come true, as I had always been mildly depressed that this brilliant show was going on that I could never, ever be a part of. And now I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my character, I play Timmy, the head of Research &amp;amp; Development for, well, I guess the entire universe. It’s a relatively good gig for Timmy, but there’s a lot of overtime, he’s often a scapegoat, and he has to clean up the Deity’s messes and misunderstandings of his own orders. I purposefully played my character as someone who knows what he has to do to deal with a clueless jerk of a boss, but also knows he’s valuable enough that he doesn’t have to take too much crap. I get to do a lot of improvisation and input on my character, so I really get to make it my own. Outside of the semi-regulars (Larry, Lucy [Lucifer], and Jesse [Jesus]), I’m actually the first-ever recurring role on the show, which is a huge kick in the pants. I’ve done three episodes so far, and word is I’ll definitely be in the next season. Season 3, which just wrapped up with a cliffhanger that actually won’t be resolved until season 5, will be on DVD soon, and we just recorded the commentary for it. You’ll definitely want to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(For those of you who aren’t familiar with Mr. Deity, here is episode numero uno. Jarrett isn’t in this episode but it is quite awesome and gives you a feel for what the series is all about!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Are you going to TAM this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I couldn’t be happier to say that yes, I am, finally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with us Jarrett! You are a great guy and a blast to be around. I definitely look forward to seeing you at TAM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Amy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275250529632"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/elephant.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf436f0e0e221e91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="random photograph"/><title type="html">Elephant</title><published>2010-05-30T20:31:06Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T20:31:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/tGWyIWcUkpw/elephant.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/elephant.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gregladen.com/secret_folder/DSC_3675.jpg" alt="a picture of something" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/elephant.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/tGWyIWcUkpw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275250516509"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=1954">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc059814bb0d1ccd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="creationism"/><category term="religion"/><category term="life"/><category term="abiogenesis"/><category term="evolution"/><category term="biology"/><category term="intelligent design"/><category term="ID"/><category term="God"/><category term="Catholic Church"/><category term="Vatican"/><category term="chemistry"/><category term="argument from ignorance"/><category term="god of the gaps"/><category term="DNA"/><category term="Bible"/><category term="faith"/><category term="origin of life"/><category term="RNA"/><category term="chemical evolution"/><category term="theology"/><category term="organic"/><category term="inorganic"/><category term="matter"/><category term="Craig Venter"/><category term="Reasons to Believe"/><category term="old earth creationism"/><title type="html">Science Creates Artificial Cell and Creationists Spin, Spin, Spin</title><published>2010-05-30T20:15:02Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T20:15:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/science-creates-artificial-cell-and-creationists-spin-spin-spin/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks back, a bombshell of an announcement hit the scientific world:&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64J5RY20100527?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=scienceNews"&gt; the first artificial cell has been synthesized in the lab.&lt;/a&gt; Needless to say, this is a big deal, because it not only has vast implications for bio- &amp;amp; genetic engineering, but the discovery can help fill in gaps in our knowledge of how life evolved naturally from non-life (see my previous blog post on this issue – &lt;a title="Permanent link to The God-of-the-Gaps Just Got  Smaller: Link Found Between Life &amp;amp; Inorganic Matter" rel="bookmark" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/the-god-of-the-gaps-just-got-a-little-smaller-link-found-between-life-inorganic-matter/"&gt;The  God-of-the-Gaps Just Got Smaller: Link Found Between Life &amp;amp;  Inorganic Matter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/synthetic-cell.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="synthetic-cell" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/synthetic-cell.jpg?w=349&amp;amp;h=261" alt="" width="349" height="261"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s also interesting is the reaction from some religious &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Creationist_Arguments"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt; circles concerning this discovery.  First, there is the &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100521/ap_on_re_eu/eu_catholic_church_synthetic_cell"&gt;response from the Catholic Church warning scientists not to “play God”…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catholic &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100521/ap_on_re_eu/eu_catholic_church_synthetic_cell#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#366388"&gt;Church officials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Friday that the  recently created first synthetic cell could be a positive development if  correctly used, but warned scientists that only God can create life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vatican and Italian church officials were mostly  cautious in their first reaction to the announcement from the United  States that researchers had produced a living cell containing manmade  DNA. They warned scientists of the ethical responsibility of &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100521/ap_on_re_eu/eu_catholic_church_synthetic_cell#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#366388"&gt;scientific progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and said that the manner  in which the innovation is applied in the future will be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a great scientific discovery. Now we have to  understand how it will be implemented in the future,” &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100521/ap_on_re_eu/eu_catholic_church_synthetic_cell#"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#366388"&gt;Monsignor Rino Fisichella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  the Vatican’s top bioethics official, told Associated Press Television  News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we ascertain that it is for the good of all, of  the environment and man in it, we’ll keep the same judgment,” he said.  “If, on the other hand, the use of this discovery should turn against  the dignity of and respect for human life, then our judgment would  change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m all for proceeding cautiously in this particular research, because there is the potential for abuse, just as there is with any kind of new technology.  But read between the lines of what the Vatican is saying – they seem to be implying that, somehow, this artificial life is fundamentally different from “normal” life simply because of the manner in which it was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This assertion may or may not be true, but their reaction seems to be motivated by a version of the &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/God_of_the_Gaps_Fallacy"&gt;god-of-the-gaps argument.&lt;/a&gt; Think of it this way: if this discovery indeed pans out, it could fill in a very big gap in our scientific knowledge of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life"&gt;origin of life.&lt;/a&gt; However, if you’re a religious institution (such as the Catholic Church) which bases a huge part of its theology on the idea of life as somehow being “special” because it was “created by God”, then this discovery has some disturbing implications for your theology.  Thus, to maintain your theology, you redefine the artificial life generated in these experiments to be somehow “different” than “real” life forms created by your God.  This is, as any skeptic will easily see, just a variation on &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Moving_the_Goalposts"&gt;moving the goalposts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interesting reaction comes from Fazale Rana, a biochemist employed by Christian apologist ministry &lt;a href="http://www.reasons.org/"&gt; Reasons to Believe.&lt;/a&gt; Reasons to Believe is an&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Earth_creationism"&gt; Old-Earth Creationist&lt;/a&gt; outfit – that is, they believe the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old and the universe is approximately 14 billion years old (in keeping with modern geology &amp;amp; astronomy), but they adhere to the creationist notion that life was somehow “specially created” and they reject biological evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fazale Rana’s comments on the generation of the first artificial cell seem to be like moving the goalposts, stating that this discovery is somehow “proof” of so-called &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Intelligent_Design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an apologetics standpoint, this is exciting work  that I’m happy to see pursued and would like to see even more effort  devoted toward this because it’s giving us a very powerful case for  [Intelligent] Design.  In fact, I even would go so far as to say that  this is even a brand new class of arguments for Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… This is a third approach that says, ‘We think that life  is the work of a designer because we know from empirical experience now  that to make life requires ingenuity, careful planning, careful  manipulation of chemicals in the lab under exacting conditions in order  to generate lifeforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it shows conclusively in the most compelling way possible  that life requires a mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I find this point-of-view interesting is two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; it seems to be completely at odds with the Vatican’s stance, which is staunchly pro-life (but &lt;em&gt;which kind&lt;/em&gt; of life, the discerning reader will ask) and very suspicious of the intelligent design arguments put forth by outfits such as Reasons to Believe &amp;amp; the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute"&gt;Discovery Institute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; the discovery of this artificial cell puts paid to an oft-repeated creationist argument that goes something like this: &lt;em&gt;“Until you can make life in the lab, I will never accept that evolution is true!”&lt;/em&gt; This is a variation on the argument that&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB000.html"&gt; life can only come from life, and that it isn’t possible to generate life from non-life.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if come creationists who have made this claim repeatedly over the years will give the validity of those arguments a second glance, or if they’ll just somehow engage in spin, such as that displayed by the Vatican &amp;amp; Reasons to Believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, science will march on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should apply.  I once said the Cubs were going to win a baseball game… and they did!  I have a gift.  So do all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could make some &lt;a href="http://seattle.craigslist.org/see/etc/1751519148.html"&gt;decent money&lt;/a&gt;, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Generous hourly rates will be paid based on gross sales of psychic services rendered through website (currently between $53.55 per hour and $116.55 per hour of logged talk/chat time).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no desire for anyone to take the money of unsuspecting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’d love to see a reader get the job &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   It would just show that they’ll hire anyone and that anyone can make up stories about their “psychic abilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.meetyourpsychic.com/apply/"&gt;The application is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s full of wonderful questions, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Describe in detail your prior psychic experience and corresponding dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you deal with an irate customer who insists you are wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[And the grammatically incorrect:] Please check on the tools do you use to assist in your readings?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is that if you have a good application, they might call you back for a live test reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone, please do this.  And let me know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Nathan&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

Kelly Hamilton, John Freshwater’s attorney, &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/05/freshwater-stro.html" rel=""&gt;pissed off the judge&lt;/a&gt; in the federal suit against Freshwater, and now Freshwater himself has done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freshwater has taken to providing “updates” to the Mt. Vernon Board of Education regarding the administrative hearing on his termination.  He uses the public comment period during Board meetings for those “updates.”  In &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE2jdVSfzoo&amp;amp;feature=PlayList&amp;amp;p=8167D7356999ED71&amp;amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;amp;playnext=1&amp;amp;index=1" rel="external "&gt;his most recent&lt;/a&gt;, on May 10, 2010, among other things Freshwater revealed the terms of settlement negotiations being held under the Court’s aegis, and provided the Board with email from the Dennis family’s attorney with a settlement offer, an email that was clearly marked “Confidential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dennis family through its lawyer subsequently asked the federal judge to issue a gag order, and following a hearing on the request on May 26, 2010, the judge issued that order binding on all parties to the suit.  In his order the federal judge said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognizant of the fact that Plaintiffs have not behaved in any way that would warrant this Court’s application of a gag order against them, the Court indicated that it would grant Plaintiffs’ request for a gag order and that the order would be applicable to all parties and attorneys involved in any way in this action. The Court then explained to Mr. Freshwater that, aside from the privilege issue, his behavior jeopardizes the Court’s ability to seat an impartial jury in this matter, which it has a duty to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from the last paragraph of the order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court, reiterating its stern warning given to Mr. Freshwater in court, will not tolerate violations of this Gag Order. Any violation will meet serious consequences, including monetary sanctions and other sanctions up to and including the most severe this Court can impose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial of that suit is due to begin July 26.  It’s becoming very clear that the federal judge will not permit the kind of shenanigans Hamilton and Freshwater have been engaging in during the administrative hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was invited last year to participate in a &lt;a href="http://www.whyichoose.org/webcasts/video.html"&gt;webcast about vaccinations.&lt;/a&gt; This was conducted by the California Department of Public Health. They invited me because they had searched the web and found an article that I did with Randy Ferrance, DC, MD on vaccinations for Dynamic Chiropractic in February of 2005: &lt;a href="http://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=50074"&gt;What&amp;#39;s Good for the Goose Is ... Ethics and Vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In that article, Perle writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, what should chiropractors do regarding vaccinations? Obviously, we believe that it is unethical to recommend avoiding vaccinations while also recommending adjusting, because of the comparable level of risk. Likewise, we would agree that for a chiropractor who strongly believes that vaccinations are bad, and believes that adjusting is good, telling patients who ask about vaccinations that they should have them is also a significant ethical problem. While doctors need to respect their patients&amp;#39; autonomy rights, they also need to respect their own. The great problems in ethics occur when two rights or duties are in conflict. Thus, for the anti-vax chiropractor, we see a significant ethical distress. The solution, we believe, was developed by the College of Chiropractors of Ontario. Its Standard of Practice S-015 states: &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chiropractors may not, in their professional capacity, express views about immunization/vaccination as it is outside their scope of practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot; It seems best, since there are questions as to the ethics of recommending avoidance of immunizations, to not say anything at all.

I went from having &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/about.php"&gt;long, curly hair&lt;/a&gt; to having my head completely shaved.  It was a brand new look for me, and although it took some getting used to, I decided to keep it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/6520_1219052955620_1207789153_938902_3533631_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/6520_1219052955620_1207789153_938902_3533631_n-thumb-500x375-50102.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="6520_1219052955620_1207789153_938902_3533631_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I decided to make it interesting.  I started teaching intro to astronomy, the largest class I've ever taught (with a final enrollment of 63).  And as an incentive for my students to write the best paper they possibly could, I threw in a personal extra: whoever scored the highest on the paper in the class would get to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/weekend_diversion_beard_contes.php"&gt;choose what facial hair&lt;/a&gt; I'd grow, and I promised them I'd keep it at least six weeks (so they could see it when they came back from winter break), and if I liked it, I'd keep it for longer!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, their choices were virtually limitless.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/beardtypes1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/beardtypes1-thumb-500x391-50097.jpg" width="500" height="391" alt="beardtypes1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There is someone, by the way, trying to grow &lt;a href="http://www.dyers.org/blog/beards/beard-types/"&gt;every type&lt;/a&gt; on this chart.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the two winning students (there were two perfect scores) chose a goatee.  And when I asked "with or without a moustache," they both said "with."  So I stopped shaving in a goatee-shape, and it started coming along.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/originalgoatee.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/originalgoatee-thumb-500x664-50100.jpg" width="500" height="664" alt="originalgoatee.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I heard about &lt;a href="http://beardteamusa.org/events/nationals/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;b&gt;USA championships&lt;/b&gt; for the beard and moustache team!  Not only is it in Bend, OR (just 150 miles from me), but it's the first ever USA championships!  They have four separate categories:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Best moustache.&lt;/b&gt;  Beards are allowed in this category but the contestants will be judged on their moustaches only;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. Best partial beard.&lt;/b&gt;  Includes goatees, van dykes, sideburns, musketeers, etc.;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3. Best full beard.&lt;/b&gt;  Styling aids are permitted;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4. Freestyle.&lt;/b&gt;  Anything goes. Anything. Be creative.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I knew right away that category two was going to be for me, so I started growing out the "balbo" style in the chart up top in addition to the goatee/moustache I had going.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it went through a slightly awkward phase towards the beginning, but that didn't last long.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/17834_1373526417360_1207789153_1417915_635340_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/17834_1373526417360_1207789153_1417915_635340_n-thumb-500x375-50106.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="17834_1373526417360_1207789153_1417915_635340_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months, it had grown in nicely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/25238_1433377873609_1207789153_1567844_7650517_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/25238_1433377873609_1207789153_1567844_7650517_n-thumb-500x389-50108.jpg" width="500" height="389" alt="25238_1433377873609_1207789153_1567844_7650517_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, just about six months in from the original start date, here's what my beard and moustache look like.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/30140_1483073515969_1207789153_1687627_2172223_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo/30140_1483073515969_1207789153_1687627_2172223_n-thumb-500x375-50110.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="30140_1483073515969_1207789153_1687627_2172223_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're wondering, next weekend, why there isn't a new weekend post up, it's because &lt;i&gt;I'm competing at the Beard Team USA championships!&lt;/i&gt;  I'm still not sure why long beards have been out of favor for so long, but I'm really digging the one I've got going now; I'll keep you posted on what comes of it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275241238302"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=3455">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/622ba6fa5088e19f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Literature"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="Daniel Loxton"/><category term="Embiggen Books"/><category term="literacy"/><category term="news"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="rationalism"/><category term="science literacy"/><category term="skeptic books"/><category term="skeptic education"/><category term="Skeptical Books for Children"/><category term="Skeptical books for kids"/><category term="Warren Bonnet"/><title type="html">When Giving ‘Evolution’ To Your Nephews Is Not Welcome: Skeptical Books for Children – Part Six</title><published>2010-05-30T16:01:26Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T16:01:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/btoKmfLcCjM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/05/when-giving-evolution-to-your-nephews-is-not-welcome-skeptical-books-for-children-part-six/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geologicpodcast.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Picture-81.png" alt="" width="480" height="71"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Firstly, I’d like to confess to blatantly taking a question off a Facebook page that was not meant for me – as you can tell by the picture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ve written to the person, and thankfully they were open to hearing my views, it just so happens to be the kind of issue that I’ve been working on for a while. This person is quite right in being concerned and they have all my sympathy – how does one maintain relationships when there’s a clash with science and religion, and it’s your family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a few recent events which coincide with this case. I interviewed Daniel Loxton on the issues some atheists had with his book (&lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/03/09/episode-twelve-on-science-and-atheism/"&gt;Token Skeptic #12 – On Science and Atheism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/03/09/episode-twelve-on-science-and-atheism/"&gt; – Interview with Daniel Loxton&lt;/a&gt;). In addition, I recently learned that a very good friend of mine has got at least one publishing house very interested in printing his science and skepticism book – which has a target audience of young adults. What if people who try to promote his book come across similar conflicts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing about &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/01/skeptical-books-for-children-part-one/"&gt;skeptical books for kids&lt;/a&gt; for… well, if you look at the first &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2008/01/skeptical-books-for-children-part-one/"&gt;Skeptical Books for Children&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, you’ll see that it’s dated February, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://podblack.com/?p=305"&gt;Skeptical Books for Children – Part Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://podblack.com/?p=383"&gt;Skeptical Books for Children – Part Three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://podblack.com/?p=486"&gt;Skeptical Books for Children – Part Four&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(and in response to a question from the radio show Skeptically Speaking) &lt;a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?q=http://podblack.com/2009/10/skeptical-books-for-children-part-five/&amp;amp;ei=4NkhS8SrHc2HkQXbptynAw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=nshc&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAoQzgQoAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGTYi0FVsQS6pZE8MdJk6ZoIA2J1A"&gt;Skeptical Books For Children – Part Five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s a segue into gender and literacy skills, with &lt;a href="http://podblack.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/mind-the-gap/"&gt;Mind The Gap&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on reading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has much changed since I wrote those posts? Not really, I’d say. There are still people who are wanting to find good books for children and promote scientific literacy. I even ended up &lt;a href="http://www.scriptphd.com/?p=746"&gt;co-presenting at Dragon*Con on the topic of gender and science literacy&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s is another facet that intrigues me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have argued in the blog-posts I’ve made on ‘Skeptical Books for Children’ is that it is better to address general science literacy and promote overall concepts – rather than directly challenge head-on, topics that are bound to cause debates. In the end, I think the goal should be promoting thinking, first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a transcript of what Warren Bonett, in the most recent &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Skeptic Zone podcast&lt;/a&gt;, suggested – you can hear it in &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=619471&amp;amp;comments=on"&gt;Episode #84 of our show!&lt;/a&gt; Warren is the proprietor of the &lt;a href="http://embiggenbooks.com/"&gt;Embiggen Books Bookshop in Noosaville, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, in the north-east of Australia. The bookshop is devoted to promoting rationalism and science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kylie: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve recently read on Facebook how an uncle was criticised for giving Daniel Loxton’s ‘Evolution’ book to his nieces. Do you have any advice on how to handle situations like that, when people know that there’s going to be opposition when promoting a book, or discover it inadvertently?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warren:&lt;/strong&gt; This is something I have come across from time to time, and there’s no one simple ‘book’ or guide to give to people that will handle all the situations. Everyone has their own kind of tentativeness about it. I’d suggest starting with things that are more ‘off-topic’ – stay general? Stay with things that are to do with critical thinking, start with the basics. Don’t just start with subjects such as evolution, as that can open up a lot of other things at the same time, and that will prevent any critical engagement with the subject at all. I would tend to start with just thought, just thinking – Phillip Cam’s books, for example, or Dr Karl Kruszelnicki’s. And those at the Skeptics conference would also remember Peter Macinnis who has written some great books for piquing people’s interest in the world around us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If for adults, perhaps  things like ‘Crimes Against Logic: Exposing the Bogus Arguments of Politicians, Priests, Journalists, and Other Serial Offenders’ by Jamie Whyte, or ‘Demon-Haunted World’ by Sagan, which is of course, a classic. Or perhaps something like Bill Bryson’s A short History of Nearly Everything which merely celebrates the amazing history of science and learning about everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid books that might be misinterpreted as ‘attacking’ any particular issue, other than the way people think about things. I think that’s the best place to start on any of those sorts of things. If the adult that is receiving the book or if they come into the store themselves and they are indicating that perhaps they are open to something a little bit more, then you could perhaps be more direct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example, we were holding a ‘Charles Darwin Day’ and some women came into my shop. One of them said “Oh, what are you doing that for, wasn’t he one of the most evil men in history?” These were university-educated, 40-something women, who weren’t particularly religious. They simply had this misconception. So, I handed them both a biography of Charles Darwin, which they devoured in 24 hours and now they run the local non-fiction book-club meet up for women and have recently brought Hitchen’s ‘God Is Not Great’ and a variety of others! They’re amazing – they just devour all the books!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my own part, this is what I ended up writing to the person from Facebook, and I hope that it’s of use to them – and perhaps to others. Feel free to add your own advice in the comments, as I think this is an ongoing concern for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In general, I guess it’s a matter of who is actually able to be spoken to here. And I’d say it’s the father, who allowed the book to be passed on? Am I right in thinking he’s the one you’re related to, and not the children’s mother?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d suggest contact him and point out that it wasn’t your intention at all to do the things she accuses you of. Point out that you were hurt and confused, feeling like you were completely out on a limb. It doesn’t matter how angry she was, she had no right to just be that rude. You’re family, and he’d be just as upset if it were YOU who called HER and yelled names at her down the phone, over what was a well-intentioned gift of a Bible or something! In my opinion, it’s somewhat understandable and yet still an over-reaction on her part. It’s entirely likely she’s feeling a little embarrassed about how she behaved, if she reflects upon it!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d suggest asking, with his guidance, what you might be able to do to regain contact with the family, even if it means that you agree not to interact with the sister-in-law. I don’t think that it’s likely that you’ll see eye-to-eye on certain topics (of course!) but you can agree not to bring them up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fact is, parents are the ones who will have the say over what their young kids will read (as is standard, as they are raising them) – and issues involving science that might challenge their religious views might very well be something that you’ll have to wait over time before you can discuss with them, if at all. Encouraging kids to work hard at school, suggesting non-directly challenging books that promote critical thinking and philosophy in general, may be a better approach. I’d suggest, after this event, running what you’d like to give past both of the parents, pointing out that you only want to do the right thing by them all!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if you are worried about how she’s raising them, there’s something that you can certainly do if she is starting to criticise you and your lifestyle around them. Setting a good example in how you live your life is something the kids will observe. Challenging the stereotype that she has in mind is another way, which is something they’ll certainly pick up on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the end, it’s a matter of choosing a battle and in this case, it may not be worth fighting if it loses you much-loved family – but you can also quite subtly prove her wrong as well, by being a family member who, on a number of fronts, really should be valued. Even if you do not believe in a religion as they do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Science and religion, if properly understood, cannot contradict each other . . . “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to say you have to either suppress your sexuality or lose your faith.  But neither one is easy or she would’ve done it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a long overdue move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopathic medicine is nothing but a placebo that gullible people choose to take.  The government shouldn’t be paying for their delusional thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pratik Kanjilal&lt;/strong&gt; writes in the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; that this would be a foolish move.  Here’s just one excerpt from his irresponsible piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… homoeopathy is routinely denounced because no one knows how it works. But a physician should be asking a simpler question: does it work for my patient? The doctor’s primary concern is to offer a cure, or at least comfort. Ruminations about its scientific basis come later. Many patients turn to alternative schools when mainstream medicine fails and leaves them facing chronic disability and pain, or the inscrutable mystery of death. Unless homoeopathy is unequivocally proven to be quackery, which is not the case, it is irresponsible of doctors to bar access to it. It smacks of scientific fundamentalism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It.  Is.  Quackery.  Unequivocal quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, watch a group of skeptics “overdosing” on homeopathic medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QgHfBADYW6o%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing happens to them.  Because there’s nothing in those pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if it ought to be the last word, Kanjilal finishes his piece with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And by the way, did I mention that Queen Elizabeth II has a personal homeopath?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow…. who cares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would think the Queen also has a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; medical staff to look after her.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole article is representative of the homeopathic side: the pills make them feel good, so there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be some science involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onetechmonkey &lt;a href="http://onetechmonkey.com/2010/05/indian-snake-oil/"&gt;points out flaws throughout the piece&lt;/a&gt; and is worth a read.&lt;br&gt;

Dubbed the 'Conakry Monster', it washed up on the coast of Guinea in May 2007. It was described as being a gigantic crocodile/lizard monster with an armoured back, fur, a long tail and 'four paws'! The blackened surface to the skin led some people to think that it might have been burnt... somehow.

Some of the noisiest, most obnoxious, most self-indulgently prolix and goofy critics of the New Atheism are full-of-themselves pomposities like Eagleton and Fish, and now we can apparently add another, Marilynne Robinson. She&amp;#39;s a novelist — I have not read any of her books, but they have received quite a bit of critical acclaim — and she recently gave a series of lectures, now published as a book, &lt;i&gt;Absence of Mind&lt;/i&gt;, in which she is going to &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/26/AR2010052604894.html?hpid=sec-religion"&gt;give the godless a piece of her mind&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for her, it seems to be a small sliver, very spongy and soft, and it bounces off like a bullet from a nerf gun. This review starts off promisingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Absence of Mind" derives from the Dwight Harrington Terry lectures on "religion, in the light of science and philosophy." [&lt;i&gt;uh-oh, bad sign already: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/the_eagleton_delusion.php"&gt;Eagleton's awful book&lt;/a&gt; was also a product of the Terry lectures&lt;/i&gt;]  As Robinson tells us in her introduction, her book aims to "examine one side in the venerable controversy called the conflict between science and religion." In particular, she wants to question the kind of authority claimed by certain modern scientists and to raise questions about the quality of their thinking. In her first chapter she focuses on what one might loosely call the sociobiologists, thinkers like E.O. Wilson, Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett, who assert that our lives are ordered by overt or unconscious self-interest, that our minds are unreliable and constantly trick us, and that traditional religious belief is a primordial hold-over, certainly childish, sometimes deluded and generally embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, actually, I think she's got it right. At least that's how I feel about the matter. Charges accepted, officer. Now all she has to do is show that she can criticize the anti-religionists without demonstrating that her position actually is rather embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson argues strenuously that such thinkers grossly simplify religious thought and testimony -- and they ooze condescension. "The characterization of religion by those who dismiss it tends to reduce it to a matter of bones and feathers and wishful thinking, a matter of rituals and social bonding and false etiologies and the fear of death, and this makes its persistence very annoying to them." She notes that these same crusading debunkers consistently portray those who dare to disagree with them as intellectually dishonest, as naifs who refuse to face facts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooooh, I don't think she like us. But OK, show us that she can face the facts. Show us that religion is something more than the delusion we say it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Robinson says, these "parascientists" deliberately slight "the wealth of insight into human nature that might come from attending to the record humankind has left." At the very least, "an honest inquirer" into the nature of religion "might spend an afternoon listening to Bach or Palestrina, reading Sophocles or the Book of Job." We are not, she maintains, simply the instrument of selfish genes. Indeed, she suspects that the "modern malaise," our sense of emptiness and alienation, can be attributed not to the "death of God" but rather to the widely promulgated, and reductionist, view of the self as wholly biological. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad start. Criticizing legitimate scientists by coining a new label for them, parascientist, while incapable of demonstrating that she has any grasp of science herself is a very bad idea. See this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/scientific_impotence.php"&gt;article on scientific impotence&lt;/a&gt;: what she's doing is trying to pretend that the scientists who disagree with her aren't doing science. But then, she's no scientist herself, so if thinking scientifically is a virtue and unscientific ideas are grounds for insulting people, where does that leave her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists know about and appreciate art. Seriously, does she think we've never listened to Bach, and all we have to do is hear the &lt;i&gt;Magnificat&lt;/i&gt; and presto, we&amp;#39;ll believe in God? We admire and respect the accomplishments of our fellow human beings — &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; of flesh and bone and nerve and sinew — and it is no surprise that they can create beauty. This is no argument against us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are not the product of our genes (and many other natural and material influences, as any biologist will tell you), then what else? Does Dr Robinson have any component to add, other than supernatural, magical stuff for which she has no evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what modern malaise? I don't feel empty and alienated, do you? Almost all the atheists I know seem to be enthusiastic and cheerful, with a real sense of optimism about the future. If it's just the miserable god-botherers who don't understand science who are moping along under the cloud of this imaginary malaise, I don't think you can logically blame their psychological problems on being depressed about the conclusions of biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, God is dead. But we aren&amp;#39;t at all sad about it — we&amp;#39;re dancing on his grave. Viewing the self as biological is a wonderfully liberating way to see the world, too, since it means we don&amp;#39;t have to rely on the whims of uncommunicative ghosts to find fulfillment in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is, she&amp;#39;s just a blustering babbler with a lot of resentment towards those darned scientists who keep on shaking up her comfortable illusions about her soul. She takes another step, though, and this is where she does embarrass herself — she uses her ignorance about a significant medical case in the history of science to bash away at &amp;quot;parascientists&amp;quot; some more, and she gets it all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson assails Wilson and company most powerfully by accusing them of faulty, narrow-minded thinking. Take their frequent use of the story of Phineas Gage, the railway worker famous for surviving an accident in which a large iron rod was driven through his skull. Afterwards, according to contemporary accounts, his behavior changed dramatically and he was "fitful, irreverent, and grossly profane." For the parascientists, this proves that personality and character "are localized in a specific region of the brain," a fact, adds Robinson, "that, by their lights, somehow compromises the idea of individual character and undermines the notion that our amiable traits are intrinsic to our nature."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But Robinson asks us to actually think about Phineas Gage. How would you feel and react if you had had your upper jaw shattered, lost an eye and suffered severe disfigurement? Gage "was twenty-five at the time of the accident. Did he have dependents? Did he have hopes? These questions seem to me of more than novelistic interest in understanding the rage and confusion that emerged in him as he recovered." In the parascientific writings about Gage, she asserts, "there is no sense at all that he was a human being who thought and felt, a man with a singular and terrible fate." In essence, these scholars "participate in the absence of compassionate imagination, of benevolence, that they posit for their kind." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, yes, Phineas Gage did have a very serious accident that almost killed him, and seriously damaged his brain, resulting in changes in personality and behavior. That's a well-documented fact. But Robinson's claims about the interpretations of this event are bizarre and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one claims that &amp;quot;personality and character &amp;#39;are localized in a specific region of the brain&amp;#39;&amp;quot;. In the 19th century, phrenologists were all over the Gage story, but their claims are no longer accepted. Personality and character are diffuse in the brain, with different regions contributing different, interacting  influences. The forebrain, for example, has (in very broad terms) a restraining effect on impulses — it&amp;#39;s a region involved in thinking ahead and recognizing possible consequences, and damage to this area, as in the case of Gage, can lead to the kinds of behavior he exhibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't even know what she means by "compromises the idea of individual character". Does she think scientists reject the idea that individuals have different personalities? Our minds are complicated ensembles of modules that generate our thoughts and behaviors; we're all different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &amp;quot;undermines the notion that our amiable traits are intrinsic to our nature&amp;quot;…no, that makes no sense. Actually listen to what those New Atheist scientists are saying, and you discover that they&amp;#39;re actually arguing that our &amp;#39;amiable traits&amp;#39;, like empathy, cooperation, morality, actually do have a biological foundation, as do some of our more hostile traits, like competition and aggression. She&amp;#39;s arguing that we hold a view that is the exact opposite of the one we actually endorse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of her account is equally fantastic. She seems to be implying that maybe there wasn&amp;#39;t a discrete change to the functioning of his brain, but that he was just rightfully upset about a devastating accident. This is absurd. The doctor who treated him happily reported that his recovery went well and that he seemed to have full return of his mental faculties — it was Gage&amp;#39;s friends and family who reported that his personality had changed to the point of unrecognizability. This is the report Dr Harlow published on the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;His contractors, who regarded him as the most efficient and capable foreman in their employ previous to his injury, considered the change in his mind so marked that they could not give him his place again. He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest profanity (which was not previously his custom), manifesting but little deference for his fellows, impatient of restraint of advice when it conflicts with his desires, at times pertinaciously obstinent, yet capricious and vacillating, devising many plans of future operation, which are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for others appearing more feasible. In this regard, his mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he was "no longer Gage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the "parascientific" writings about Gage, by which Robinson actually means the genuinely scientific writings, there certainly is a focus on fact and observation. Read &lt;a href="http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/11/2/281"&gt;Harlow's account of the accident&lt;/a&gt;, for instance: what you will see is a dispassionate account by a doctor who was doing everything in his power to keep a seriously injured man alive. I'm not sure what Robinson expected in these writings; that they do not indulge in hysterics, that Harlow did not treat the patient with prayer or literary readings from the Book of Job, may disappoint her, but do not indicate that the doctor had a lack of feeling for Gage as a human being. That Harlow followed the case of his patient for at least twenty years suggests that perhaps there was more to it than Robinson can believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2007/07/the_incredible_case_of_phineas.php"&gt;an account of the Gage accident&lt;/a&gt; here on Scienceblogs, and I can tell you that it is also a common entry in introductory biology textbooks — but the interest is precisely because this was a human being with hopes and fears and a unique personality who was tragically changed by a sudden accident. To claim, as Robinson does, that scientists have no sense of Gage as a person, that they lack a &amp;quot;compassionate imagination&amp;quot; is simply rank defamation and dehumanization. It is the vile bigotry of a provincial mind that substitutes prejudice and stereotype for actual knowledge of what scientists think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good review of her book, though. It convinced me that I needn't bother reading anything she's written.&lt;/p&gt;

I know it's a powerful piece of work with iconic status, but it's also misleading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/wanna_t-shirt.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DpswyGtuvcU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275229401001"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-7949906671714763833">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48d34c640ef60416</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gary McKinnon" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">A Skeptic Looks at the McKinnon Case: Part One</title><published>2010-05-30T11:51:00Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T11:51:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2010/05/skeptic-looks-at-mckinnon-case-part-one.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">This is the first of a series of blogposts looking at the well-known and controversial case of Gary McKinnon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What interests me about this particular case is the fundamental mismatch between, on one hand, the passionate campaign in his support and, on the other other, the continued upholding of the decision to extradite by the Home Office and the English court system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This mismatch made me wonder whether either the campaign or the upholding of the decision is misconceived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, and in accordance with the subtitle of this blog (see above): &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the legal position being misrepresented? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is there a misuse of law?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would appear that the McKinnon campaign have succeeded in promoting a widely-held view that this case is a miscarriage of justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may be those whose opinions on the McKinnon case are so strongly held (one way or the other) that they see no point for this blog to examine the case in a source-based and skeptical manner; if so, they are welcome to scroll down to the comments box to now type away and, subject to the comments moderation policy, their comment will be published.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, for those who want to base their opinions - especially very strongly held opinions - on sources, then I set out below the first part of my examination of the McKinnon case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is culled from a far-longer piece I am writing, but it became too unwieldy for a single post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This first part sets out the procedural history of the case and the actual allegations which the US government are making against Mr McKinnon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;(For your information, I personally oppose the extradition for reasons which will give in the last part of my examination of this case.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The Procedural History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alleged criminal activity of Mr McKinnon took place over thirteen months, from February 2001 to March 2002.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was interviewed under caution and his computers seized on 19 March 2002, and he was again interviewed under caution on 8 August 2002. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In November 2002, the East Virginian US District Court charged this &lt;a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cyberlaw/usmck1102vaind.pdf"&gt;Indictment&lt;/a&gt; (which should be read in full by anyone interested in this case).  The  New Jersey US District Court also charged this &lt;a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cyberlaw/usmck1102njind.html"&gt; Indictment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to what happened next, until May 2006, para 21 of the first High Court judgment&lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; sets out the US explanation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Of particular note here are the plea bargain negotiations of April 2003 to June 2003, on which more in the second part.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 10 May 2006 (after it appears a year of adjournments), Bow Street Magistrates' Court acceded to an application made on behalf of the Government of the US government and sent Mr McKinnon's case to the Home Secretary for a decision as to whether or not Mr McKinnon should be extradited.  The decision to proceed with the extradition was made by the Home Secretary on 4 July 2006.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 13 and 14 February 2007, the High Court heard Mr McKinnon's appeals of the decisions of the District Court and the Home Secretary on the basis of a wide range of human rights and abuse of process arguments.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 3 April 2007, the High Court in a reasoned judgment dismissed the appeals: read the judgment &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On 16 June 2008, the House of Lords heard Mr McKinnon's appeal of the High Court decision.  In a unanimous and reasoned judgment given on 30 July 2008, the House of Lords dismissed the appeal: read the judgment &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/59.html"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(On 28 August 2008, the European Court of Human Rights refused Mr McKinnon's &lt;a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;amp;documentId=839381&amp;amp;portal=hbkm&amp;amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649"&gt; application for "interim measures" so as to stay the extradition&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within four weeks of the House of Lords decision, Mr McKinnon was diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome.  There is no reason to doubt this diagnosis, and such late diagnoses are not uncommon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This diagnosis enabled Mr McKinnon to have a new legal basis to challenge the extradition decision.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Home Secretary was asked to reconsider the extradition decision, but the decision was made to continue with the extradition on 13 October 2008.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Permission to apply for "judicial review" of this new extradition decision was &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/170.html"&gt; granted on 23 January 2009&lt;/a&gt;, but the substantive application for judicial review was &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/2021.html"&gt; refused by the High Court  on 31 July 2009&lt;/a&gt;, and an application to appeal that refusal was also &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/2449.html"&gt; refused on 8 October 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, in summary, other than obtaining permission to apply for judicial review, Mr McKinnon's case has not succeeded before the Magistrates' Court, the Secretary of State, the High Court, the House of Lords, the Secretary of State (again), and the High Court (again).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, other than obtaining permission to apply for judicial review, each single judge has decided against Mr McKinnon's case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the McKinnon Campaign is correct in that Mr McKinnon's case represents a fundamental miscarriage of justice, then this uniform rejection of his case by each court and each judge is extraordinary, and it would be a matter for the gravest concern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The Allegations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is sometimes not clear from the reporting on the McKinnon case what are actually the allegations against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, Geoffrey Robertson &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/16/gary-mckinnon-aspergers-extradition-justice"&gt; states&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"In 2002, from a council flat and with a battered first-generation laptop, McKinnon hacked into US army computers with a gusto and brilliance attributable to his Asperger's. He left a polite message of political protest against the post-9/11 Bush administration: 'US foreign policy is akin to government-sponsored terrorism these days.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we will see, this is not an altogether accurate description of the allegations; even the date he gives is perhaps misleading.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The allegations against Mr McKinnon have not essentially changed since the original charging by the East Virginian and New Jersey US District Courts in 2002.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, taken from the &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; April 2007 High Court judgment&lt;/a&gt;, the allegations can be described as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - that for thirteen months, Mr McKinnon gained unauthorised access to 97 US Government computers, &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 3 here&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - that Mr McKinnon deleted critical operating system files from nine computers and this led to a 24 hour shutdown of 2000 computers in the Washington network of the US Military, &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 4(1) here&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - that Mr McKinnon deleted 2,455 user accounts on one particular US Army computer, &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 4(2) here&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - that Mr McKinnon deleted system files and logs from computers at the US Naval Weapons Station responsible for the identity, location, physical condition, staffing and battle readiness of US Navy ships, rendering the station's entire network of over 300 computers inoperable at a critical time immediately following 11 September 2001, &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 4(3) here&lt;/a&gt;; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - that Mr McKinnon copied data, account files and passwords onto his own computer,  &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 5 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr McKinnon also left the following message on one Army computer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"US foreign policy is akin to Government-sponsored terrorism these days … It was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on September 11 last year … I am SOLO. I will continue to disrupt at the highest levels … &lt;/span&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are, of course, only allegations; there has not yet been a trial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it would appear that forensic analysis of the computers seized from Mr McKinnon confirms these allegations (see &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 7 here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also appears that the alleged activity, if not the damage caused, was admitted to by Mr McKinnon in his two interviews under caution, &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; see para 8 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One wonders whether these allegations are more serious than many of those who have strong opinions about the case realise, especially those allegations which go beyond mere unauthorised access to extensive file deletion and the file copying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here one can note that the High Court said of the submissions of Mr McKinnon's barrister (&lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html"&gt; para 30&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"In our view Mr Lawson has tended to understate the gravity of the offences which Mr McKinnon is alleged to have committed. At the same time he has tended to overlook the fact that, if prosecuted and convicted, the equivalent domestic offences include the offence under &lt;a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/ukpga_19900031_en_3#pt2-l1g12"&gt; section 12 of the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990&lt;/a&gt; for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this was repeated by the House of Lords at &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2008/59.html"&gt; para 38 of their judgment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"As the Divisional Court itself pointed out (at para 34), the gravity of the offences alleged against the appellant should not be understated: the equivalent domestic offences include an offence under section 12 of the Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990 for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The starting point for any sense of injustice in this case must surely be the seriousness of the allegations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But - in my view - the allegations are more serious than are commonly represented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, the allegations appear - again in my view - to have been misrepresented by those campaigning against the extradition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, this does &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; make such allegations true, and certainly not proven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And even it the allegations are serious, they are not determinative of any exercise of mercy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;In Part Two, later this week, the failed plea bargain and the relevance of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Act_2003"&gt; Extradition Act 2003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.

On May 29th, Anthony Ayiomamitis used a 16 cm (6″) telescope &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Sat-ISS-2010-05-29.htm"&gt;to capture a &lt;em&gt;phenomenal&lt;/em&gt; image of the International Space Station passing Jupiter… &lt;/a&gt; in broad daylight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.gr/Images/sat-iss-20100529.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/ayiomamitis_iss_jupiter.jpg" alt="ayiomamitis_iss_jupiter" title="ayiomamitis_iss_jupiter" width="610" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Note the color of the sky; it was about 9:00 a.m. local time when he took &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Sat-Trans-2010-05-25.htm"&gt;this shot&lt;/a&gt;, with the Sun well above the horizon. This is actually two images added together; the first shows the ISS to the lower right, and in the second shot it had moved to the upper left. Jupiter shows its disk near the center of the frame, it being easily bright enough to be seen using a telescope in daylight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an incredible picture! But it gets cooler…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.perseus.gr/Images/sat-iss-20100529-labels.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/ayiomamitis_iss_jupiter2.jpg" alt="ayiomamitis_iss_jupiter2" title="ayiomamitis_iss_jupiter2" width="350" height="228"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The picture on the right is the same shot, but this time he connected the two ISS images with a line. Given the size of both the ISS and Jupiter, it looks like the station flew directly in front of the planet from Anthony’s position! Had he taken that first shot literally a tenth of a second later, he would have had the picture of a lifetime. As it is, it’s still way cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want more? I got more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Vanderbei, at Princeton University, &lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/images/Questar/jupiterDaytime.html"&gt;took this picture of Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;, also in daylight. You can see the moons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/images/Questar/jupiter_0012_flat_wavelet_PS_overlay.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/vanderbei_jupiter_daytime.jpg" alt="vanderbei_jupiter_daytime" title="vanderbei_jupiter_daytime" width="609" height="451"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture has the moons labeled. Ganymede and Europa are faint, but visible. For an added coolness, Io was poised right on the limb of the planet’s disk. You can see the Red Spot, and also how &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/12/how-will-jupiter-hold-up-his-pants/"&gt;the southern equatorial belt of Jupiter is missing&lt;/a&gt; (it should be at about the same latitude as the Red Spot). To get this Robert used a 9 cm (3.5″) Questar ’scope, which is small but has &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; nice optics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one more, but it’s a link: &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2010/05/28/amateur-astronomer-images-x37-b-space-plane-in-orbit/"&gt;Universe Today is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that an amateur got shots of the Air Force X37-B in orbit! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this goes to show that the word &amp;quot;amateur&amp;quot;, as I’ve been saying for years, is losing its meaning. Like everything in nature, when you get near the boundary between two entities, the lines get blurry. I know lots of so-called amateurs who have a far keener grasp of the sky and the objects in it than some professionals. Astronomy is one of the few sciences where someone with even modest equipment can do phenomenal work in the field. I love it, and it’s a great time to be an astronomer!&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/health/30salt.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=alton%20brown%20cargill&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;today's NYT&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Salt is a pretty amazing compound,” Alton Brown, a Food Network star, gushes in a Cargill video called Salt 101. “So make sure you have plenty of salt in your kitchen at all times.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign by Cargill, which both produces and uses salt, promotes salt as “life enhancing” and suggests sprinkling it on foods as varied as chocolate cookies, fresh fruit, ice cream and even coffee. “You might be surprised,” Mr. Brown says, “by what foods are enhanced by its briny kiss.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Briny kiss", yep, that's classic Alton.  Yeesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in fairness, there does not appear to be anything in that statement that I think Alton Brown doesn't really believe, and in fact I quite agree with that limited statement.  The problem, of course, is that what I believe in and what Alton Brown (I think) believes in is appropriate salting by the home cook -- which in many ways is not so much about how much salt you add, but &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; you add it.  A fear on the part of the home cook to employ salt properly can result in more salting at the table, resulting in the same sodium content but inferior food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But salt used by home cooks is not the problem, nor is it what Cargill is worried about.  Sure, Cargill wants home cooks to use salt, but not because that's a significant profit driver -- Cargill just wants to improve the public image of salt overall so that it can keep selling truckloads of it to the makers of processed food, who use quantities of sodium that are absolutely staggering.  Few home-cooked foods will ever come close to equaling the amount of salt that is used in TV dinners, crunchy snacks, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alton Brown &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to know this, and he has to know what it's all about.  And it's weird that he seems so blasé about it, given his open disdain for most processed foods in his show and his writing (even as I'm sure that infuriates the Food Network execs, whose profit is largely driven by advertising for... processed foods!)  I mean, this is a guy who's encouraging people to make their own &lt;i&gt;marshmallows&lt;/i&gt; for chrissakes!  And now he's shilling for Cargill??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sad.  Though, what do I know, maybe he's hard-up for cash.  Maybe he's a secret gambling addict or something.  In my financial situation right now, if Cargill wanted to pay me to sing the praises of salt, I'd ask where do I sign.  Hell, if they wanted me to sing the praises of &lt;i&gt;asbestos&lt;/i&gt;, it wouldn't take that much.  But I assumed Alton Brown was well enough off to be judicious about his source of income.  Apparently not.  Or maybe he just doesn't care.

One of the problems is that Ardi is supposed to have lived 5.5 million years ago, according to John Hawks, but all estimates of the human-chimp divergence say it occurred between 3 and 5 million years ago. If that's true then Ardi is not in either the chimp or human lineages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The human-chimp divergence is based on calibrating the molecule clock and that's what John addresses in his post. He seems to think that this calibration is accurate [&lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genomics/divergence/ardi-and-the-clock-2009.html"&gt;Reviewing the clock, and phylogenomics&lt;/a&gt;] but I'm not so sure. Many of these studies (but not all) require calibrating the rate of change by using fixed time points inferred from the fossil record. For example, if you assume that primates and rodents last shared a common ancestor 100 million years ago then you can get a rate of change by adding up the number of changes in each lineage and dividing by 100 (substitutions per million years). Then you look at the number of substitutions in the human and chimp lineages and calculate the years since they diverged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an over-simplification, as John explains on his blog, because the calibrations are also based on known mutation rates and population genetics. The theoretical models agree on a human-chimp divergence time of 3-5 million years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been skeptical of the fossil record calibrations for many years because they give some very unreasonable divergence times and because the so-called "fixed" standards also seem unreasonable. The molecular clock ticks at an approximately constant rate but we just don't know what that rate is. I would have no problem accepting that humans and chimps diverged 6-7 million years ago.&lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Reconstructions: Copyright 2009, J.H.

The post posited that there are certain clouds that appear in the sky that can be used to predict the onset of earthquakes.  It referenced this brief article about rainbow-colored clouds over Los Angeles that were similar to those supposedly seen prior to earthquakes in China and Chile, replete with user comments trumpeting doom for the region through various conspiracy theories, destruction that ended up never taking place.

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;i&gt;Missing comma, police decide to hire a grammarian&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;Missing his mom, Joe called home&lt;/i&gt;?  No, wait a minute, this isn&amp;#39;t about the police missing womanly company — those first two words are not a gerund-participial predicative adjunct.  Could &lt;i&gt;missing&lt;/i&gt; be a modifier of &lt;i&gt;women police&lt;/i&gt;, then?  The remains were found in a remote area by some female police officers who had been reported as missing?  A bit implausible.  What about &lt;i&gt;find&lt;/i&gt;?  Is that really a tensed verb with plural agreement?  Could it be a noun instead (as in &lt;i&gt;a new find&lt;/i&gt;), with &lt;i&gt;remains&lt;/i&gt; being the main clause verb, as in Paul Simon's line &lt;i&gt;the roots of rhythm remain&lt;/i&gt;?  No; it's not making any sense at all.  You just can't figure out a plausible story.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Unless perhaps you're already following the news from Bradford, a Yorkshire town in northern England.  The story is about a sadistic maniac who styles himself "the crossbow cannibal".  (He calls himself this despite already being in custody.  This is going to be a difficult case for the defense to win.  The police have him on closed-circuit TV shooting a prostitute through the head with a crossbow.) A whole team of police has been search the River Aire, where this man has been throwing parts of the women he has killed and cut up.  The BBC headline above, which refers to the finding of some more human remains in the river, has the nominal &lt;i&gt;missing women&lt;/i&gt; (itself composed of a participle modifying a noun) as an attributive modifier of &lt;i&gt;police&lt;/i&gt;, to make the singularly ungainly noun phrase &lt;i&gt;missing women police&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd think a team of subeditors would have been called out on a crash blossom alert, and fixed it.  But not so. The phrase &lt;i&gt;missing women police&lt;/i&gt;, despite its stylistic clumsiness, currently appears as a tag for a "read more" pointer at &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10192974.stm"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, and has been picked up &lt;a href="http://forbster.com/news/19172/missing-women-police-find-remains/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.videonewslive.com/view/454131/missing_women_police_find_remains"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://morning-digest.jpmblog.com/?p=3493"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aajmedia.com/news/2010/05/uk-missing-women-police-find-human-remains/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and so on, as it makes its way round the world via the strange uncritical electroplagiarism that is a large part of the modern news industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS LECTURE IS SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW, 1st June at the Library.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://slwa.wordpress.com/"&gt;The State Library&lt;/a&gt; does not make any judgment about individuals, groups or organizations, unless there is a clear breach of law, policies or procedures, in which case we may act to exclude clients. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I acknowledge your opposition to the Australian Vaccination Network but this does not provide grounds for the State Library to exclude this group from using a public facility for lawful means -&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/whats_on/events"&gt;Margaret Allen, Chief Executive Officer and State Librarian, State Library of Western Australia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Paul Effler, the medical co-ordinator of the immunisation program in WA, said people no longer saw the diseases prevented by vaccines and so focused on the side effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I think vaccines have been a victim of their own success,” he said. “If you think of a world with no vaccines, think of what disease rates in children would look like. It would be like going back 50 years and seeing what meningitis did to children, killing them and making them deaf… &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Dr Effler said the rise in conscientious objections was partly because some parents had been convinced by anti-vaccine campaigners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt; – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/7305739/child-vaccination-rates-plunge/"&gt;The West Australian Newspaper, ‘Child Vaccination Rates Plunge’, 28th May, 2010.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you seated comfortably? Then we’ll begin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in Australia, there was a horrible, horrible group who called themselves the Australian Vaccination Network or the ‘AVN’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike their rather sensible and science-forward-sounding name, they were actually all about telling parents and communities that vaccinations gave kids autism and poisoned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cheerful (and bordering on the demented) dedication, they gave misleading advice in parenting magazines, radio shows and essentially anywhere they could snap up an audience. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/05/meryl-dorey-of-avn-returning-to-perth-and-the-alexander-library-take-action/"&gt;This included the State Library of Western Australia, with a lecture scheduled in June.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because of their name, many media groups in their country thought they had some kind of authority behind their claims and would often consult them in an effort to create ‘balance’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even had groups book them to do lectures, as they posed as health advisory experts and drew upon sciencey-sounding claims that were also touted by people overseas with similar goals to them. Some of those overseas people used terms like ‘&lt;em&gt;mother’s intuition&lt;/em&gt;’ on popular daytime programming, and had famous boyfriends who gave them insane amounts of money to keep them shining the smiles that turned up on Oprah specials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah? Oprah. Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Oprah, the one that features in a Newsweek article called “&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/200025/page/2"&gt;Why Health Advice on ‘&lt;em&gt;Oprah&lt;/em&gt;‘ Could Make You Sick”&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2217798"&gt; was criticised in Slate Magazine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the AVN was Meryl Dorey, and many Australian skeptics could quite easily point out her errors in reasoning, using the power of the internet, speaking out at public venues and even running advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the growing evidence to the above statement, there was always the gruesome reality that this was much like the James Randi ‘unsinkable rubber duck’. Worst of all, Dorey and her followers treated with intense cruelty those who tried to question them, especially if they were lone families or individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such case was the tragic death of a little baby. The AVN claimed that it wasn’t because whooping cough rates rising due to lowered vaccination rates in their region as a result of their intense campaigning – and in fact, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/05/03/a-guest-post-from-david-mccaffery/"&gt;shouldn’t the parents of the dead child make the autopsy records available to the AVN on demand so it can be dragged through the mud even further for their ends?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.antivaxxers.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/WHY-MERYL-DOREY-IS-AGAINST-THE-SWINE-FLU-VACCINE.pdf"&gt;Meryl Dorey’s endorsement of David Icke&lt;/a&gt; (a British writer who promotes the notion that vaccines are deadly, and has also devoted himself since 1990 to researching “who and what is really controlling the world’, and claims that the Illuminati are a race of reptilian humanoids and that many prominent figures are reptilian, including Queen Elizabeth II)… was also rather disconcerting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;“…we are already seen as rabid, idiotic fringe-dwellers by so many in the mainstream, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;it does our argument no good to bring in conspiracy theories which, &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;though we may subscribe to them&lt;/span&gt;, are unprovable” – &lt;em&gt;Meryl Dorey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the AVN leapt at the chance to spread more misinformation in Western Australia, after reports from the Department of Health and Aging reported on how ‘&lt;a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mr-yr10-dept-dept300410.htm"&gt;Health authorities continue to put seasonal flu vaccine on hold for young children&lt;/a&gt;‘. Sadly, it appeared that the State Library of Western Australia wants to promote the AVN and their message regardless.&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody may live particularly happily-ever-after if the lecture at Perth’s Alexander Library is canceled – but at least it’s an improvement over promoting pseudoscience and dangerous anti-health views, in what should be a venue that promotes education and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The only kind of religion that might possibly pass this test is one that embraces some kind of nebulous god (although I don't think one exists). I think all of the so-called divinely revealed religions based in the ancient superstitious past fail this test. And yet, it didn't have to be this way had there been more evidence to believe. The evidence just doesn't exist for any of them. Christianity, for instance, could pass the OTF if God provided the needed evidence to believe. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-would-convince-me-christianity-is.html"&gt;But he didn't do so&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4033339104726212632?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Here's an excerpt from the show transcript:
Another scientist is taking a different approach to geoengineering. Instead of looking to the sky for solutions, he's looking to the ocean. Victor Smetacek, a German oceanographer, is trying to cool the planet by growing carbon-absorbing gardens in parts of the ocean with little life.

In 2009, Smetacek and a team of Indian and German scientists added 6 tons of iron into a section of the Southern Ocean, which rings Antarctica, to see if they could get a massive bloom of algae to flourish. Algae growing in the ocean cools the planet by sucking in carbon dioxide. The team did get algae to grow, but it was the wrong kind of algae.

The 10-week experiment, called project LOHAFEX, is the world's largest geoengineering project to date, and, like many other geoengineering attempts, was controversial. Greenpeace and other environmental organizations demanded that LOHAFEX be stopped from the start, saying that pouring iron into the ocean amounted to pollution and violated international agreements. Some scientists feared the unintended side effects of the project.

&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Eric and got a copy of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn… This kid has body parts made of brass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is impressive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hello, everyone. Tonight is a rather auspicious occasion, marking the closing of one door and the opening of several others. The Greenwood Community High School Class of 2010 has experienced much together — our journey has encompassed seven years, four of which have established a foundation for the rest of our lives. During these four years, some of us have found our niche in English, Foreign Language, Social Studies, Business, Physical Education, The Fine Arts, Mathematics, and/or The Sciences. For me, I found my place in the latter. Science never stops asking “why” until it has uncovered “how” and never stops asking “how” until it has determined “why.” Science uses both logic and reason to assess the world around us — to explain and improve our relative universe. Science is a product manifested from secular humanism; it is devoid of delusion, ideological zealotry, and blind ignorance. Science is, in essence, the purest form of intellect. In addition to finding a passion for science, though, I also learned that taking a stand for principles far surpasses the respect, the acceptance, or the repudiation of anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Jefferson once said, “In matters of principle, stand like a rock.” I have never fallen short of President Jefferson’s credo in this respect, as I am sure you are aware. You may not agree with my decision to fight for civil liberties, but I expect you to respectfully listen while I elucidate. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states, in part, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” This implies that no entity, agent, or facet (however subsidiary) of the government is to ever endorse, promote, or encourage any form of religion or religious doctrine. This, as you may or may not know, includes school-sponsored prayer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September of last year, our remarkably doltish administration called upon us all to vote in deciding whether or not we wanted the Constitution of the United States to be flagrantly violated. Understanding the law and knowing right from wrong, I vehemently opposed such an atrocious act from ever taking place. However, my one voice and the voices of others were shouted-down by most of you. Our rights and the law were disregarded. You see, subjecting government-endorsed prayer to a majority rule is, in and of itself, unconstitutional, let alone the government approbation of said prayer. Founding Father Thomas Jefferson is quoted as having said, “All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in [most] cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate [them] would be oppression.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual freedoms were subjugated, the United States Constitution was omitted, and most of you were unfazed. I, however, was fazed — I, however, took action to redress this grievance. On March 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a lawsuit on my behalf to legally halt any and all school-sanctioned prayer at tonight’s commencement ceremony. On April 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, Federal District Judge Sarah Evans Barker issued an injunction to do just that. In her ruling, Judge Barker stated that “the degree of school involvement ma[de] it clear that [any graduation] prayer [would] ‘bear the mark of the state,’ and accordingly [transgress] the Constitution.” I solemnly hope that you all do understand that the Greenwood Community School Corporation had its hand in this from the beginning, that the Greenwood Community School Corporation thought (and still likely thinks) it was and is above the law, and that neither the Greenwood Community School Corporation nor any other government entity is above the law. In challenging my lawsuit, the Greenwood Community School Corporation accrued a debt of legal fees and court costs to the ACLU, totaling approximately $18,000. For the School Corporation’s legal representation, you can expect the debt to be exorbitantly greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather unfortunate that Joe Farley and his Milquetoast myrmidons chose to allocate funds to battle, in futility, a precedent that has held firmly in law since its issuance from the United States Supreme Court. These tens of thousands of dollars could have been better used to maintain the teaching positions being cut in the coming academic year due to a lack and administrative mismanagement of funds. Nonetheless, $18,000 will be spent appropriately, helping the ACLU to further its mission to protect and defend freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I leave you with your thoughts, I would like to thank and acknowledge those who have, above all, influenced and inspired me for the better. Firstly and foremost, I thank my mother, Kathy, for believing in me and my abilities. Her love, care, and guidance have been immeasurable assets in my journey through life thus far. Secondly, I thank my sister, Tiffany, for being my rock in times of hardship. She will never know how grateful I am to have her in my life. Thirdly, I thank my grandparents, Richard and Betty, for providing me with the love and encouragement that enriches me, my life, and my future. Their hearts have touched mine more than they know. Fourthly, I thank Becky Kehler for shaping me into the scientist I am today — an individual who does not stop asking “why” until he has uncovered “how” and who does not stop asking “how” until he has determined “why.” It was she who gave me both the unparalleled opportunity and vast resources necessary to thrive and prosper as a research scientist in High School. Fifthly and finally, I thank Suzanne Schulz for teaching me to never compromise myself or my principles for anyone or anything. Her candor and unyielding disposition have been hallmarks in shaping me and my outlook on the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for permitting me the chance to speak with you tonight. It has been a pleasure for me and, hopefully, a teaching moment for you. Before we part, though, I leave you with these words: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One ought never to turn one’s back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it. If you do that, you will double your danger. But if you meet it promptly and without flinching, you will reduce the danger by half. Never run away from anything. Never!” — Sir Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, Class of 2010; the best is about to begin!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch &lt;a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/video/23716117/"&gt;video clips of the speech here&lt;/a&gt; — and the disrespect shown from the audience as he speaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I gave a speech at my high school graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nowhere as gutsy and memorable as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see what Eric does in his future.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-announce.htm"&gt;Wakefield investigation&lt;/a&gt; was the longest in the history of the GMC, with the disciplinary panel sitting for a total of 148 days over a period of 2 and a half years at an estimated cost of one million pounds. The results of the investigation were revealed in a 143 page report on 28th January 2010, and found that Wakefield showed a “callous disregard” for childrens’ suffering and “abused his position of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GMC “..determined that Dr Wakefield’s name should be erased from the medical register…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision follows an investigation into Wakefield’s behaviour surrounding the 1998 publication of a scientific paper in The Lancet journal, linking the triple MMR vaccine with gastrointestinal disorders and autism. Although the study itself did not demonstrate the MMR vaccine caused autism, Dr Wakefield urged caution and advised parents to get single injections against measles, mumps and rubella at a subsequent &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/royal-video.htm"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield’s statements resonated world wide, scaring many parents away from vaccinating their children and firmly cementing the anti-vaccination movement. The resulting drop in vaccine compliance, spurred on by a complicit media, continues to contribute to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, mumps and whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield was found to have brought the medical profession “into disrepute” after he took blood samples for the study from children attending his son’s birthday party in return for 5 pounds “reward”. He later &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTHDKNEx3lo"&gt;laughed and joked at a conference&lt;/a&gt; about the children fainting and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It’s unbelievable that Wakefield would expect this method of collecting samples for a study to be ethical and above board. He is either completely clueless when it comes to the strict procedures instructed by ethics committees or he’s a completely incompetent researcher. Or perhaps his ego got in the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition Wakefield conducted unnecessary, painful and intrusive diagnostic treatments on children, including colonoscopies and spinal taps, procedures for which he did not have ethics approval to undertake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further investigations, Sunday Times journalist Brian Deer revealed that Wakefield did not disclose serious financial conflicts of interest. Deer provided evidence that Wakefield was &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm"&gt;paid thousands of pounds&lt;/a&gt; by lawyers seeking a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield also had a patent pending on &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-patents.htm"&gt;his own single measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the one he urged parents to seek out at the press conference following the publishing of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, ten of the thirteen authors on the Lancet paper &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/02/09/what-more-do-the-mmranti-vaccers-want/"&gt;withdrew their names from the publication&lt;/a&gt; stating; “We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient. However the possibility of such a link was raised and consequent events have had major implications for public health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a further six years before the editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:ewfdV87KEFcJ:press.thelancet.com/wakefieldretraction.pdf+lancet+retraction&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=au&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEEShmohPj_UHJsv724vDO36T4IN1slgKGEAC3cUQtWNMa1rACN4SnrfGHnUSszz7UY9ttbB1-vLFqeHK9IX1Bonr_zly_CnVw5FEF-olgh44tMSabQ7mA1G97J3Ay1_tY6c0x4MOm&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbRj8gZhY4XO1jxeM4VCyZWaLqwYQw"&gt;retracted the paper&lt;/a&gt;, which effectively means it is now scratched from the scientific record. Another Wakefield paper which was accepted for publication in the journal NeuroToxicology was also subsequently &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/another-blow-for-wakefield-as-neurotoxicology-paper-withdrawn/"&gt;withdrawn&lt;/a&gt;.  This study attempted to show a link between thimerosal and impaired neurological development and was nick-named “14 monkeys”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield relocated to the US in 2005, where he established and was director of the alternative medicine clinic for children with autism spectrum disorders, known as &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt;. The clinic has come under fire for using questionable treatments such a chelation, a scientifically unproven therapy for autism. He was pressured into resigning his position following the GMC findings in January. (Interestingly, the “Founders” tab on their website is broken, and there is no mention of Wakefield anywhere that I can find. Wakefield has been effectively erased from their records).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent events, the anti-vaccination movement continue to rally around their “poster boy”. Wakefields’ supporters called the findings “unjust”, a “smear campaign” and “a sad day for our children.” Generation Rescue, a zealous anti-vaccination group in the US, (publicly represented by Jenny McCarthy), issued a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.generationrescue.org/wakefield"&gt;statement of support&lt;/a&gt; following the GMC findings in January;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Dr. Andrew Wakefield is perhaps this debate’s greatest hero. He’s a doctor who has held onto the truth, unbowed, through pressure that would break most mortals. Dr. Wakefield’s influence in saving other children from the fate that befell so many children is incalculable.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments left on the Age of Autism website were supporting calls for &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/come-support-dr-andrew-wakefield-at-nbcs-today-show-this-monday.html"&gt;Wakefield to be knighted&lt;/a&gt;. How people can support such a fraudulent and discredited man is completely beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s summarise the chain of events that led to Wakefield getting struck off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Wakefield was getting paid by lawyers putting together a class action suit against the manufacturers of MMR for 2 years prior to the publication of the Lancet paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• He called for parents to seek out a single vaccine for measles – &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-patents.htm"&gt;he had a patent&lt;/a&gt; on his own single measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The PCR data was found to have come from contaminated samples and &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/nick-chadwick.htm"&gt;could not be independently confirmed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Pathology results were fabricated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• No conflicts of interest were declared when the paper was submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• He did not have ethics approval for some of the studies on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such a small study (12 children) that did not even examine a vaccines/autism link, it is incredible to think that it had such a large impact on public health. But of course the blame does not solely lie with Wakefield. The media were highly complicit in spreading the fear about the MMR vaccine. And the result of their misinformation was MMR vaccination rates in the UK &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;fell from over 90% to below 80%.&lt;/a&gt; And although the anti-vaccine movement  was well and truly active at this stage, it must be acknowledged that this boosted their cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after 10 of the 12 authors removed their names from the paper in 2004 for “public health” reasons, Brian Deer exposed the conflicts of interest and fraudulent practices, the Lancet retracted the paper completely in 2010, rapidly followed by &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/news/another-blow-for-wakefield-as-neurotoxicology-paper-withdrawn/"&gt;NeuroToxicology doing the same&lt;/a&gt;, the GMC called Wakefield dishonest and irresponsible, he got shafted from the woo-fest that is Thoughtful House, he was stripped of his license, people continue to rally around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No respectable medical journals are gonna touch him again. Although he is on the editorial board of the quack-fest that is &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.medicalveritas.com/expertauthors.html"&gt;Medical Veritas&lt;/a&gt;, The Journal of Medical Truth, along with other prestigious anti-vaxers such as Veira Shreibner. Actually itr seems quite a shame really. If you search PubMed for AJ Wakefield, you get 15 reviews and 112 other papers. He was a prolific publisher, especially for a clinician, but it matters not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently he sat down to be &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIsFW5phHas"&gt;interviewed by Mercola&lt;/a&gt; in a five part series on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although clearly Wakefield knew what was coming – I mean he wrote it in his book, which was published weeks ago, and entitled “Callous disregard”, that he lost his medical license. Harriet Hall has had the stomach to read the book, you can read her blog  about it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5343"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking prior to the GMC hearing on May 24, Wakefield told the BBC he was not responsible for the resurgence in measles. He has also said he categorically denies suggestions that he had acted dishonestly, or against the best interests of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not attend the GMC hearing in London, rather choosing to appear on the Today Show in New York City where he was &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37313063/ns/today-today_health/"&gt;interviewed by Matt Lauer&lt;/a&gt;. The interview is a clear illustration of him now believing the rheteoric, as he repeatedly insists that his Lancet findings been repeated in five different countries and that there is a link between vaccines and autism. He also tells Lauer the GMC  decision is a PR exercise designed to ruin him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a flurry of research spurred on by Wakefield’s 1998 study, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/latest/announcements/special-court-rules-that-vaccines-are-not-linked-to-autism/"&gt;no link between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt; has been found and Wakefield’s original findings have not been reliably replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at an &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/dr-andrew-wakefield-at-the-american-rally-for-personal-choice.html"&gt;anti-vaccine rally in Washington on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Wakefield said he plans to set up a virtual university where he will design studies and recruit researchers to carry out the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield’s colleague, Professor Walker Smith, a senior author on the study has also been struck off the UK medical register. The other doctor under investigation, Professor Simon Murch was found not guilty of professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith and Wakefield have 28 days to appeal the decision. Wakefield has indicated that he planned to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

My fiance ran across one on Facebook a few weeks ago that fit this description, focusing on the terror-evoking, sky-creeping vapor masses known as earthquake clouds.

That's just nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re even doing it in an entirely bogus way — they&amp;#39;re teaching it as a controversy in history classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Queensland schools, creationism will be offered for discussion in the subject of ancient history, under the topic of "controversies".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Queensland History Teachers' Association head Kay Bishop said the curriculum asked students to develop their historical skills in an "investigation of a controversial issue" such as "human origins (eg, Darwin's theory of evolution and its critics").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is confusing. It sounds like they&amp;#39;re going to be babbling about whether the earth is 6,000 years old or 4.5 billion years old, but that isn&amp;#39;t history — that&amp;#39;s just lunacy. There is some relevant history that could be taught, such as that from Ron Numbers&amp;#39; book, &lt;i&gt;The Creationists&lt;/i&gt;, which explains how ideas about creationism changed over the years, talks about the major figures in the creationist movement, and describes how creationism itself has changed historically…but I doubt that the people who are backing this want the subject addressed seriously as a series of events in the last 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear that they&amp;#39;re just trampling on history as a back door to get pseudoscience into the curriculum. I keep telling people, these creationists are cunning — the science side of the debate has gotten hardened by repeated attacks, and is usually better prepared to resist the foolishness, so they switch targets and catch history or philosophy off guard. &lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; academic discipline is subject to this corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a few years, and if they&amp;#39;re beaten back by the history professionals, just wait until they try to sneak in by claiming creationism is math, or health, or physical education (oh, wait, they&amp;#39;ve already gotten in there — in lots of schools, it&amp;#39;s the Christian athletes who are often the center of creationist activity).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/what_is_wrong_with_you_queensl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/1P4Xe3wpEn8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275191233347"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/bird_and_bees.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90192ee81f63d206</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Bird and bees</title><published>2010-05-30T04:31:06Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T04:31:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/DA-84rreI3A/bird_and_bees.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/bird_and_bees.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gregladen.com/secret_folder/DSC_3716.jpg" alt="a picture of something" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/bird_and_bees.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/DA-84rreI3A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275190677936"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c63d6818be01de2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Baby on Board</title><published>2010-05-30T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-05-30T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/parental/babysign.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did the death of an infant in an auto accident lead to the invention of 'Baby on Board' signs?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275190542171"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=1030">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e0821dbd84d25e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Serious overreach"/><title type="html">Listening to parents at AutismOne</title><published>2010-05-29T19:50:35Z</published><updated>2010-05-29T19:50:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1030" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="float:right;margin-left:10px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/NatListn4.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:4px 6px" title="NatListn" src="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/NatListn4-150x150.gif" alt="" width="92" height="94"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The anti-vaccine movement frequently complains that the medical establishment doesn’t spend enough time listening to parents. Sometimes the news and entertainment media take the bait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to overlook the larger and direct dangers inherent in (Jenny McCarthy’s) position on vaccines,” &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1967796-4,00.html#ixzz0pM5lQDUp"&gt;wrote Karl Taro  Greenfeld in Time Magazine&lt;/a&gt; last winter. “Yet it is equally difficult to ignore the  emotional core of what she is saying: Listen to parents. If doctors  won’t, then McCarthy will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “parent as victim” meme is the donkey that pulls the anti-vaccine cart. McCarthy speaks lovingly of her &lt;a href="http://www.ecorazzi.com/2008/09/30/jenny-mccarthy-strikes-back-at-amanda-peet-over-child-vaccinations/"&gt;“angry mob”&lt;/a&gt;. Generation Rescue founder J.B. Handley &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259"&gt;boasts of harnessing that anger&lt;/a&gt; to “bring the U.S. vaccine program to its knees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last week, a member of the “medical establishment” &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; listening to parents at the annual AutismOne confab at Chicago’s Westin O’Hare. What happened next shows us that the “emotional core” of Jenny McCarthy’s angry mob is as hollow as its science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A staff member of a western state department of public health was reportedly attending a session on vaccines and parental rights. According to one source, the speaker was advising parents how to apply for and receive vaccine exemptions. The session was interrupted by an AutismOne organizer who commandeered a microphone to announce that a state health department staff member was present, so parents should be careful about what was discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short time later four Westin O’Hare security guards entered the room, identified the staffer, and directed her to leave the conference facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way out, the ejected staffer asked to use the restroom. She was told that was OK, as long as an AutismOne volunteer accompanied her to the ladies room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email to an AutismOne conference organizer sent Thursday afternoon, asking for comment, has not been answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, Chicago filmmaker and independent journalist Lars Ullberg was tossed out of the Westin O’Hare, a mere ten minutes after planting himself on a seat in a lecture hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They wouldn’t even talk to me,” says Ullberg, who had paid to attend after being refused a press pass. “She (conference organizer Teri Arranga) just kept reading their ‘right to eject language.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AutismOne website states “We reserve the right not to register any  individual based on our own  judgment. We further reserve the right to  ask any participant to leave  the conference if that person’s conduct  substantially interferes with  the participation of others.”  Ullberg said no explanation was given for how his conduct (i.e., sitting in a chair) was interfering with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to attending, Ullberg had received an email from Arranga, spelling out the conditions of his attendance that would make &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/7618515/Profile-North-Koreas-Dear-Leader-Kim-Jong-il.html"&gt;Dear Leader&lt;/a&gt; proud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism One is not prepared to offer press passes to you or your crew.  Although you and each of your crew members may pay the registration fee as regular attendees, subject to the usual terms of attendance, neither you nor your crew members are permitted to conduct any videography, photography, audio recording, or press interviews; furthermore neither you nor your crew members are permitted to quote attendees, presenters, exhibitors, volunteers, or staff in any manner that will be quoted, “on the record,” or used for public or private media or instructional purposes.  Additionally, you and your crew members must identify yourselves accurately with your affiliations to those to whom you speak and also not mislead them to think that you are simply seeking information with which to help your child.  Finally, you may not eavesdrop on private conversations between attendees.  In summary, Autism One grants no permission to you or your crew to report on this conference or its attendees.  Should we become aware that you are not following these guidelines, we will not hesitate to ask you to leave the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My hope was they would actually have a conversation with me,” says Ullberg, who says many of the presenters at AutismOne are making legitimate points. Apart from quack medical claims, some speakers addressed behavioral therapy, respite care,  educational strategies, and other mainstream parent concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t learn if we don’t listen,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

When science doesn't feed your biases, reject science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology takes a look at one of these methods, which the authors term &amp;quot;scientific impotence&amp;quot;—the decision that science can&amp;#39;t actually address the issue at hand properly. It finds evidence that not only supports the scientific impotence model, but suggests that it could be contagious. Once a subject has decided that a given topic is off limits to science, they tend to start applying the same logic to other issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francisco Ayala, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/oh_the_inanity_the_dalai_lama.php"&gt;I'm looking at you&lt;/a&gt;. There are some people who are mighty quick to declare that a whole range of topics are excluded from the domain of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timmer points out another common observation, that denialism seems to encompass an entire syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…it might explain why doubts about mainstream science seem to travel in packs. For example, the Discovery Institute, famed for hosting a petition that questions our understanding of evolution, has recently taken up climate change as an additional issue (they don&amp;#39;t believe the scientific community on that topic, either). The Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine is best known for hosting a petition that questions the scientific consensus on climate change, but the people who run it also promote creationism and question the link between HIV and AIDS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DI also has HIV deniers in its midst, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeannette is the president of &lt;a href="http://minnesota.camp-quest.org/"&gt;Camp Quest of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and former president of &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/"&gt;Minnesota Atheists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her pleasant demeanor has helped her out in the strangest places, too…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Building bridges rather than walls has been rewarding for Watland. She once made a connection with someone she calls a “‘God-hates-fags’-type protestor.” Watland, a vocal gay-rights supporter, looked at the other protestor as an individual rather than an opponent. “There were people shouting at them. I started a respectful dialog,” she said. “He admitted that some of his points were wrong. [Respect] goes both ways.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watland, who is an atheist, has been confronted with hate speech while participating in Minnesota Atheists’ public events. While she realizes “It’s natural to be defensive” in situations where you’re being attacked for your beliefs, reaching out to those with differing beliefs comes naturally to her.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it includes some audio references to Monty Python’s ‘Holy Grail’ film. No, the majority of the podcast episode is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; amusing and in fact deals with the ongoing issues of torture due to the belief that witches and that confession through trials via ordeal are viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written previously on the efforts of contributor to the Australian Skeptic Magazine, Leo Igwe, on this blog: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/01/further-update-on-leo-igwe-skeptic-under-attack-in-nigeria/"&gt;Further Update On Leo Igwe – Skeptic Under Attack In Nigeria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the podcast has been held up due to the three weeks when I couldn’t get episodes out regularly, this is the last episode that was ‘missing’ from my lineup. Thanks very much to everyone who commented and were incredibly patient during the difficult time that I just couldn’t get these shows out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was particularly problematic, as I had recorded it months ago, ready to be used – and the sound-levels were just too low to allow it to be heard at all. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com"&gt;Swoopy of Skepticality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/fbbpodcast/"&gt;Rob Tarr of the Parenting Beyond Belief Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="http://paulcaggegi.com/"&gt;Paul Orlando Caggegi&lt;/a&gt;, who all sent me helpful suggestions on how to fix the ongoing problem I was having with sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/us/22beliefs.html"&gt;The recent, relevant news article that you should be checking out (and the details of the documentary) is here:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Ms. Ukpabio’s critics say her teachings have contributed to the torture or abandonment of thousands of Nigerian children — including infants and toddlers — suspected of being witches and warlocks. Her culpability is a central contention of “&lt;a title="Link to documentary’s schedule." href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-8/episode-1/"&gt;Saving Africa’s Witch Children&lt;/a&gt;,” a documentary that will make its American debut Wednesday on HBO2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those disturbed by the needless immiseration of innocent children should beware. “Saving Africa’s Witch Children” follows Gary Foxcroft, founder of the charity &lt;a title="The charity’s Web site." href="http://www.steppingstonesnigeria.org/"&gt;Stepping Stones Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, as he travels the rural state of Akwa Ibom, rescuing children abused during horrific “exorcisms” — splashed with acid, buried alive, dipped in fire — or abandoned roadside, cast out of their villages because some itinerant preacher called them possessed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;…Since “Saving Africa’s Witch Children” was first shown in &lt;a title="More news and information about United Kingdom." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/unitedkingdom/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, in 2008, Mr. Itauma’s home state has adopted a law against accusing children of witchcraft. But Ms. Ukpabio went on the offensive by suing the state government, Mr. Foxcroft, Mr. Itauma and Leo Igwe, a Nigerian anti-superstition activist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Manual of Trickery and Deception.” What a delightful read! Authors H. Keith Melton and Robert Wallace have taken a newly declassified document and made it into a fascinating collector’s item. The manuscript was lost for 50 years and only recently discovered. Now a precious few of those gadgets and subterfuges that kept me enthralled back in the 60’s when James Bond had his “Q” and Maxwell Smart had his shoe phone are out in the open. And as I suspected as a kid - many of those fantastic gadgets and weapons were real and quite a few were based on a magician’s guidebook. As part of her Geek Week, Rachel Maddow did an excellent piece on her show about this book.  Rachel even had magician John Born demonstrate a couple of the techniques.  Good job Mr. Born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#37347041"&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#37347041&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/42331.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="42331" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/42331.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="279"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I knew about magician John Mullholland when I first started looking at magic books back in the 1950’s. Later, when I became interested in mentalism and fake psychic phenomena, I purchased his classic &lt;em&gt;“Beware Familiar Spirits,” &lt;/em&gt;which tore the front off the spook business and started me on my way to mediumship. Mullholland was never a huge magic super star, but as I read his books I saw that he had a devious mind that was different from all the rest of the trickters I had read up until then. What I didn’t know (because it was classified up until 2007) was that while he plied his trade as a stage magician, he was working with the C.I.A. to teach spies how to understand misdirection, build odd devices to deliver pills, powders and liquids into drinks and devise covert operations using principles of illusion. This book is indeed a lost piece of magic history that every skeptic should have on their bookshelf. We may not want to learn how to poison an enemy or make exploding cigars, (real big bang dangerous exploding cigars) but the concepts and plans that were laid out during the Cold War era for how and where to use one hand while the other “takes care of business” are an important aspect of how we can so easily be fooled with the simplest of maneuvers. Important aspects of the conjuror’s craft like sight lines, surreptitious removal of objects and my favorite section: “Special Aspects of Deception for Women” are covered with a textbook style that is powerful enough to make any spy into a Houdini. Apparently, that’s exactly what it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/smart1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/smart2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="smart" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/smart2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="483"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Original &amp;quot;Smart Phone&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of Houdini: As it turns out, some of the most secretive devices the C.I.A. copied came directly out of Houdini’s own notebooks and methods he made use of by learning the tricks of the trade from The Davenport Brothers. History repeats itself. Many of the things we have seen in James Bond came from Houdini. No wonder I always liked Bond’s gadgets. The hollow heel we saw in &lt;em&gt;“Goldfinger” &lt;/em&gt;was based on an actual shoe cobbled together by a shoemaker named Mokana for Houdini as a concealment for escape tools. Didn’t we all really want to believe that television shows like &lt;em&gt;“Secret Agent,”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“Mission Impossible,”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;“I Spy”&lt;/em&gt; and “&lt;em&gt;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” &lt;/em&gt;had some basis in fact? How could Hollywood writers have thought up such baloney right? Most of the tricks and gadgets we may have thought ridiculous were already in common use by the time we saw it in our living rooms. Even Maxwell Smart’s shoe phone wasn’t too far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Mullholland, some of Hollywood’s best writers and make-up people were also drafted into service to help develop sceanrios and provide disguises. As a kid growing up watching mystery television, I remember watching in awe several episodes of &lt;em&gt;“Alfred Hitchcock Presents”&lt;/em&gt;and thinking to myself, if writers like Stanley Ellin, Davis Grubb and Robert Bloch could think up such nefarious clandestine devices, motifs and plot twists, what could the obviously much higher paid spies and government people be doing with &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; ideas? My magic training made me an early conspiracy thinker. As it was with John Mullholland, it turns out I was right: in most cases the bureaucracy of the C.I.A. was dreadfully inept in creative thinking and turned to Hollywood for ideas. After make-up man John Chambers received an honorary award from The Academy Awards in 1968 for &lt;em&gt;“Planet of the Apes, ” &lt;/em&gt;one of his masks that was used as a prosthetic device in a disguise operation was loaned to the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC. I must make it over there one day. It sounds like my kind of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:86px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/mull1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="mull" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/mull1.jpg" alt="" width="76" height="106"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Mullholland: The Spy Who Came In from the Magic Shop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole mind control, MKULTRA  episode that was loosely fashioned into &lt;em&gt;“Men Who Stare at Goats” &lt;/em&gt;is described in detail. It’s a nasty chapter in our history and not the laughing matter it was portrayed as in the film. When the US government found out about LSD and figured it would be the perfect weapon to control the minds of our enemies, they foolishly experimented on random citizens and even their own unsuspecting employees, some of whom committed suicide as a result. To be able to get these doses into the right places, slight of hand and misdirection was taught as an undercover technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973 , virtually all documents related to MKULTRA were destroyed. Mullholland’s manuals were thought to be among them – until a single surviving copy of each, complete with illustrations, was discovered in the agency’s archives. The manual reprinted in this book is taken directly from the only known complete copy of Mullholland’s instructions. It’s not fiction, but it reads like it. The first part of the book describes the history and the shenaningans that went on trying to get rid of Castro and is followed by an actual (?) facsimile of the manuscript, blackouts and all. Inside the manual itself, you will find hidden gems of magical thinking that because of their applications in modern day espionage, are not available in any other magic book. It’s good stuff.  If you are looking for intrigue, secrets laid bare and the inside track on the C.I.A.’s early toy chest, get this book. You won’t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, NPR has a story on the &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/dc/events/african_americans_for_humanism_conference"&gt;African Americans for Humanism conference&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. featuring CFI’s &lt;strong&gt;Norm Allen&lt;/strong&gt; and The Root’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theroot.com/users/jamilabey"&gt;Jamila Bey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127239913"&gt;listen to the whole piece by going here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Host &lt;strong&gt;Tony Cox&lt;/strong&gt;:] So, Norm, why is this such an issue for black people who believe in either humanism or atheism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allen&lt;/strong&gt;: … there have been many negative aspects to religion. For example, even though religion was used during the abolitionist movement to help free African-American slaves, the fact of the matter is that Christianity was used to enslave African-Americans in the first place. So, you have on the one hand a liberative type of force coming from Christianity. But on the other hand you have an enslaving force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so you have this dichotomy. You have this paradox that is religion. And what we believe that as non-religious people, we have to look at this objectively and talk about the positive aspects as well as the negative aspects. And it’s hard for us to move forward unless we do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cox&lt;/strong&gt;: A final thing for you, Jamila. You said that you grew up in a household where there were conflicting religious points of views, from your parents. What are you going to tell your child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bey&lt;/strong&gt;: What I do tell him is science is good. Question everything. He’s only two now, but when he’s older, I’m sure this will bite me in the behind. Question everything. There is nothing that you can’t inquire about. And if people tell you to have faith, grab your wallet and, you know, come and talk to mommy about it and we’ll find some more information for you. But don’t accept anything at all that they tell you not to question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they tell you, oh well, the pastor says this or somebody tells me this or it’ll be revealed to you. That’s code word for we don’t have a real answer, just go along with it. And we don’t do that in this house, little boy.

The findings would also shock those who happily dig into the cooked game, seldom pondering about how much lead is ingested in the process.Lead ammunition (pellets/bullets) is often used to shoot down game. To solve their research question, Pain and her colleagues bought wild-shot game birds (grouse, mallard, partridge, pheasant, pigeon, and woodcock) from supermarkets, game dealers, shoots, and butchers. After X-raying these to determine the number of shot and shot fragments present, these were cooked using typical recipes (in wine or cider or pH-neutral cream sauce). Mimicking the traditional game eating behaviour, the visible lead fragments were manually removed.The lead concentrations in the remaining flesh were analysed. The results demonstrated that the game tissue is littered with small pieces of shot- most likely due to the ammunition disintegrating into smaller particles upon impact (and, in some cases, these fragments embed into the tissues even though the shot exits the body). Consequently, a higher level of consumption of some species may result in exceeding the current FAO/WHO’s weekly tolerable intake of lead. For instance, weekly consumption of three meals of woodcock and/or ten meals of grouse / partridge / pheasant would certainly take a 70 kilogram person over this threshold.So does the consumption of game birds (shot with lead) pose a threat to humans? – The answer is very much an ‘yes’ although this depends on the amount of game consumed. As in most studies, the vulnerable population stands a good risk. And one mustn’t overlook the impact on the food chains/webs- fauna which consume these shot game birds are inevitably affected as well.

He was bringing in female patients, asking them to get naked, and then poking and prodding in places totally unrelated to their complaints. Here's one remarkably resonant sentence from the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expert witnesses told the hearing there were no acupuncture points in the vagina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yeah, we can get a flavor of what Woo was doing from that, but I'm left marveling: there are no acupuncture points &lt;i&gt;anywhere&lt;/i&gt;, it's all a load of hokum, so where do they get off rejecting so unambiguously an assertion from another quack? I see claims that sticking a needle in an ankle will fix a problem in an elbow, for instance, so using their own unsubstantiated illogic, maybe dithering about in the vagina is just the thing to fix a case of dandruff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he discusses an Intelligent Design blog, which makes the tourist look like a genius.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/the_little_man_in_the_televisi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/aVCQad7kJiI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275159719326"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_cure_for_the_priesthoods_pro.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/52c4cf7ab1ce0c9c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">A cure for the priesthood's problems</title><published>2010-05-29T17:28:54Z</published><updated>2010-05-29T17:28:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/vOf6T0R6kgo/a_cure_for_the_priesthoods_pro.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_cure_for_the_priesthoods_pro.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At last, this sounds like a &lt;a href="http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/what-about-handjobs?-women-ask-pope-201005282773/"&gt;practical solution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

I had never seen this play before, and based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_%28play%29"&gt;descriptions of the plot&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't really expect to like it very much, but in fact I thought it was brilliant, in ways that are not captured by a plot summary. It's surprising that this suprised me, since I like Chekhov's short stories very much, and for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two small linguistic footnotes follow, one intrinsic to the text, and the other related to last night's performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ut consecutivum.&lt;/strong&gt; The character Fyodor Ilyich Kulygin is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_%28play%29#The_Prozorovs"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; by the Wikipedia article as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Masha's much older husband and a teacher at the high school. Kulygin is a jovial, kindly man, who truly loves his wife, although he is aware of her infidelity. His hobby is to go for rambles (long cross country walks) with the headmaster- Kulygin is the honorary secretary for the rambling society in the local town. At the end of the play, though knowing what his wife has been up to, he takes her back and accepts her failings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kulygin mainly provides comic relief, wandering in from time to time to look for his straying wife. But he has some important lines, for example this (from the &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7986/7986-h/7986-h.htm"&gt;translation by Julius West&lt;/a&gt; at Project Gutenberg — last night&amp;#39;s production used a more recent translation by Paul Schmidt):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;To-day the soldiers will be gone, and everything will go on as in the old days. Say what you will, Masha is a good, honest woman. I love her very much, and thank my fate for her. People have such different fates. There&amp;#39;s a Kosirev who works in the excise department here. He was at school with me; he was expelled from the fifth class of the High School for being entirely unable to understand ut consecutivum. He&amp;#39;s awfully hard up now and in very poor health, and when I meet him I say to him, &amp;quot;How do you do, ut consecutivum.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he says, &amp;quot;precisely consecutivum …&amp;quot; and coughs. But I&amp;#39;ve been successful all my life, I&amp;#39;m happy, and I even have a Stanislaus Cross, of the second class, and now I myself teach others that ut consecutivum. Of course, I&amp;#39;m a clever man, much cleverer than many, but happiness doesn&amp;#39;t only lie in that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the &lt;em&gt;ut consecutivum&lt;/em&gt; is probably this part of &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dut"&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Short&amp;#39;s entry for ut&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;II.B. Introducing a temporal clause, the principal predicate being an immediate sequence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&amp;amp;S give examples of this temporal &lt;em&gt;ut&lt;/em&gt; where &amp;quot;ut A, B&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;as soon as A, B&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;since A, B&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;whenever A, B&amp;quot;. [Update: actually this guess was wrong — this term is in fact tradictionally associated with &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;ut&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; introducing a subjunctive clause of result — see the comments below for details.]  But &lt;em&gt;ut&lt;/em&gt; is protean –  &lt;em&gt;ut&lt;/em&gt; often has to be translated as &amp;quot;how&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;in what way or manner&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;as much as&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;howsoever&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;considering that&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;although&amp;quot;, or just plain &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; … So it&amp;#39;s hardly surprising that a student would find it hard to sort &lt;em&gt;ut&lt;/em&gt; out, though it seems harsh to drop someone from school for failing to recall one piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, we use obscure features of the integral calculus or of organic chemistry as intellectual gatekeepers, in place of obscure features of Latin grammar. And we don't kick kids out of school for failing to make it through the gate, we just drop them to a lower track, or suggest that they try a different major.  Anyhow, the obscure features of Latin grammar did at least have some metaphorical value that methods of integration generally lack.  (For more discussion of the curricular role of calculus, see the end of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1461"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provincial accents. &lt;/strong&gt; The three sisters of the play's title are unhappy about being stranded in a provincial town, where their father, who died a year before the play begins, was commander of a local army detachment. They yearn to return to Moscow, where they grew up, and which has become a sort of mythic land of happiness for them, especially for Irina, who was only nine when they left, eleven years before the play begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, Chekhov&amp;#39;s describes the play&amp;#39;s setting just as &amp;quot;a provincial town&amp;quot;. And a provincial town in the Russia of 1900 — especially one far enough away from the capital that the three sisters would not have gone back for a visit in eleven years — would have had a distinctive regional accent, I think, one that everyone involved would have been quite aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I don&amp;#39;t know very much about Russian dialect history, I do have one piece of personal evidence that this is likely to have been true. My maternal grandfather was born and raised in Moscow, and his wife was not. To the end of her life, he teased her about her (certain features of her) accent, although (or perhaps because) she was better educated than he was, and later became the headmistress of a school at which he taught. (She came from somewhere to the south, but the school was in pre-revolutionary Latvia — they emigrated to the U.S. in 1921, after the newly-independent Latvian government closed Russian-language schools.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see anything in the English translations of the plays to indicate that Chekhov wrote his characters' parts in ways that indicated which variety of Russian they spoke, and my Russian is not nearly good enough to figure this out from reading &lt;a href="http://ilibrary.ru/text/973/"&gt;the original&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps someone with a better command of the language can tell us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night&amp;#39;s production didn&amp;#39;t take up this potential opposition of accents in a systematic way. But one character — the woman who played Natalia Ivanovna (Natasha) — did present an identifiable provincial persona. Appropriately for Albuquerque, she came across as southwestern. She used -in&amp;#39; for -ing a fair fraction of the time — it was especially striking in the word &amp;quot;darlin&amp;#39;&amp;quot; — and a bit of monophthongization of rising diphthongs. And this impression was reinforced by aspects of her hair style, dress, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia describes Natasha this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Andrei's love interest at the start of the play, later his wife. She begins the play as an insecure, awkward young woman who dresses poorly. Much fun is made of her ill-becoming green sash by the sisters, and she bursts into tears. She apparently has no family of her own and the reader never learns her maiden name. Act II finds a very different Natasha. She has grown bossy and uses her relationship with Andrei as a way of manipulating the sisters into doing what she wants. She has begun an affair with Protopopov, the head of the local council (who is never seen), and cuckolds Andrei almost flagrantly. In Act III, she has become even more controlling, confronting Olga head on about keeping on Anfisa, the elderly, loyal retainer, whom she orders to stand in her presence, and throwing temper tantrums when she doesn't get her way. Act IV finds that she has inherited control of the house from her weak, vacillating husband, leaving the sisters dependent on her, and planning to radically change the grounds to her liking. It is arguably Natasha, vicious and insensitive of anyone besides her children, on whom she dotes fatuously, who ends the play the happiest, having achieved everything she wants. Natasha's meanness could be traced, psychologically, to the way she is made fun of in Act One, but she may just be a bad lot. Her triumph can be taken to represent that of an intrinsically insensitive lower class over the refinement of aristocratic ideals (like Lopakin's triumph in Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard) and so be interpreted politically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus for Natasha to have local characteristics of accent and dress is a nice touch, although perhaps it's slightly disconcerting in a production that doesn't otherwise adapt the Russian setting. Perhaps her regionalisms would have worked even better if the other locals in the play had shared them to some extent, or if the the Muscovites had occasionally mocked them by imitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the actress who played Natasha was criticized for regionalism in a &lt;a href="http://alibi.com/index.php?scn=art&amp;amp;story=32225&amp;amp;fullstory=y"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; by Erin Adair-Hodges in the Albuquerque Alibi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;One character … seemed to have wandered over from The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, played in a broad slapstick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Adair-Hodges didn't like the other characters' accents much either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;To be fair, actors in a Chekhov play are tasked with incredible challenges, such as using realism to approach dialogue translated from the Russian written a century ago. In this version, that task resulted in many of the actors speaking in their normal, modern American voices, which clashed harshly with the content. The default flat nasality of American speech, especially that of anyone who grew up after Valley Girl, is simply unable to treat the dialogue—and the Russian names—with the proper weight and pathos. No one's asking for a Russian accent, but an attempt to open vowels could have made a huge difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely Russian accents would have been beyond weird, suggesting a production to be featured on The Onion TV. And I'm not exactly sure what "an attempt to open vowels" means, so I can't judge whether it would indeed have made a "huge difference", and if so, in which direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this raises the whole question of how to use varieties of English in plays translated from other languages, or adapted from other places and times. This is especially important for plays in which regional or class differences in speech are featured, whether explicitly or implicitly.  I know nothing about this, except that there are people like &lt;a href="http://www.stollersystem.com/"&gt;Amy Stoller&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=Amy+Stoller"&gt;occasional LL commenter&lt;/a&gt;) who do — this would fall under the heading of what her web site calls &amp;quot;creating a consistent vocal world&amp;quot;, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

One suggestion emerging from palaeoanthropological research places a demarcation between these two regions in the form of a geographical division known as the Movius Line. Specifically, the suggestions that initially led to the Movius Line were based on observations of differing technological patterns, namely: the lack of Acheulean handaxes and the Levallois core traditions in East Asia....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Workman&lt;/strong&gt;, the valedictorian, &lt;a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20100529/LOCAL0402/5290344/1111/LIVING09/God-gets-into-Greenwood-graduation-anyway"&gt;showed exactly why he’s at the top of his class&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Workman, who hadn’t spoken previously about his opposition to student-led prayer, told the audience he was taking a stand for the U.S. Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No entity of government can endorse or promote religion or religious doctrine,” he said in a calm, professorial tone. “That includes school-sponsored prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workman said he viewed the vote as a decision on whether “the Constitution should be violated,” and that the rights of the minority against prayer should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My individual freedoms were subjugated,” the self-described scientist said in his speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his speech, people clapped and cheered, though not as loudly as for other speakers. About two dozen gave him a standing ovation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workman told reporters that &lt;a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/23693748/detail.html"&gt;he would file the lawsuit again&lt;/a&gt; in a heartbeat — even though he is a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the class president, &lt;strong&gt;Courtenay Elizabeth Cox&lt;/strong&gt;, showed how she could easily win a popularity contest in that backwards community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I would like to give thanks to God,” she said, as the audience and graduates broke into cheers and applause. “None of us would even be alive, and I personally wouldn’t be standing here, without him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The staff here and my family helped me through a lot of hardships, but I would not have overcome any of those without my faith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cox also read a verse from the Bible, adding, “Remember, people come and go, but God is always there for you… I believe he deserves to be thanked for that.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pandered to the crowd to get applause and mindlessly assumed that everyone in the audience would not be alive without her Christian god.  In other words, screw you, anyone who isn’t Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, what she said was legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Workman came out the victor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Superintendent David Edds said the school will not hold student votes on the issue or try to hold graduation prayers in future years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was while I was dating my second girlfriend and she told her parents she was dating me. I wasn't around, but when she mentioned I was an atheist, her good Catholic mother responded, "Oh. Atheist? That's disgusting."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After we broke up, her mother then sent me numerous Emails saying how glad she was that her daughter wasn't dating an atheist anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the reason I haven't had many instances in which it's been used as a derogatory term with me is that, although I'm quite outspoken about my atheism on my blog and with my friends, it's not something that comes up in most circumstances. Atheists don't have as prominent of symbols to wear around as many religious faiths. So short of asking me about my religion, it's not something you're likely to pick up on. Many members of my own family don't realize I'm not religious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, my students do know. I'd debated a few months about answering their queries on my religious status, but eventually gave up on keeping it a secret about half way through the first semester.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And honestly, it hasn't mattered. Most students just shrug with a sort of "that's nice" attitude, but I have a few students who have a large dose of incredulity at how someone could &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; believe in God. They've scoffed a few times, implying that I must be crazy to think so, or to maintain that humans share a common ancestor with all life on Earth, or that the Earth is more than ~10,000 years old, but truth be told, I tend to actually feel sorry for those students. Since the school is very sheltered and most of the students live in school housing, they're not exposed to the real world to any large extent. Those students I mentioned can only scoff and expect agreement because they're embedded in a largely sympathetic audience. As soon as they step out into the larger world they're likely to discover that value of ideas depends on more than getting a few of your friends to nod in uncritical agreement. I have a feeling these students are going to be in for a huge shock when (or if) that realization hits.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5382973732292187118?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275153070992"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=14364">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b9adba2001c835f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><title type="html">It’s Like He’s Trying to Explain Evolution to Fuckwits</title><published>2010-05-29T17:00:20Z</published><updated>2010-05-29T17:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/its-like-hes-trying-to-explain-evolution-to-fuckwits/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were my husband’s words upon viewing the following clip of Dr Ahmed Kutty, author of &lt;em&gt;Adam’s Gene and the Mitochondrial Eve&lt;/em&gt;. From the title of the book alone your alarm bells should be ringing, but from the subtitle you know it’s going to be awesome: &lt;em&gt;The Non-incestuous Descent of Man from Adam and Eve: A Paleo-anthropologic and Scientific Synthesis and Evolution Based on the Epics of Hinduism the Bible And the Qur’an: What Are the Scriptures Saying?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right: an entire book devoted to the challenge of using science to justify Biblical creationism while reassuring Christians that no, you did not come from a guy &lt;em&gt;doing the nasty&lt;/em&gt; with his sister. (But he may have fucked a monkey.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned: the stupid is strong in this one. Please keep all palms far from all faces throughout the entirety of this clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the idiot anchor did suggest that the Bible is only wrong about EVERYTHING scientific because God figured the ancient people were too fucking stupid to understand natural selection, but they would totally get the idea of clay dolls coming to life.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurray!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the history of this bill &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/19/breaking-republicans-derail-the-competes-act/"&gt; outlined in an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;. It failed the first time it went to vote because a Republican Congressman used some shameful politics to derail it, and the second time because to bring the Act to the House Floor for a vote, the Democratic majority had to put it in to pass with a 2/3 majority. Too many Republicans still voted against it, claiming it was too much spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, to be blunt, is garbage. This Act makes sure we have enough money funding science and technology to grow our economy. Not passing it would be like eating your seed corn. &lt;a href="http://www.holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=460&amp;amp;Itemid=18"&gt;As Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ) says&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;It shouldn’t take three votes to pass legislation to support the research vital to long term economic growth. If half of economic growth in the last half century is attributable to technological developments and innovations, then we can’t afford to presume that U.S. leadership in innovation is a given. If we intend to lead the global economy, we must tend to our innovation infrastructure, as this bill does.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This bill will continue the funding of the first Act, which was passed with broad bipartisan support under the Bush Administration (when Congress still had a Republican majority as well) in 2007. This time, to get it passed, the Democrats did something clever (I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When consideration resumed, Chairman Gordon moved a division of the question on the amendment included in the Republican Motion to Recommit passed by the House on May 13. This effort allowed the House to consider and vote separately on several parts of the Motion to Recommit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! This &amp;quot;division of the question&amp;quot; forced Congressmen to vote separately on the amendments added last time to scuttle the bill, so they are on record. This is clever because &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/19/competes-not-dead-and-a-mea-culpa/"&gt;the first time the Republicans sank the bill&lt;/a&gt;, they did so by adding an amendment forbidding salaries to be paid to government employees who downloaded porn. The only way to vote on the bill would have been to kill that amendment, so then the noise machine (cough cough Fox cough) could say the Democrats voted to pay people who surf porn on government machines&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By forcing this amendment-by-amendment vote, the Democrats could vote &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the porn amendment, shutting down the right-wing machine before it can even get started. Even so, I’ll note that &lt;a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll332.xml"&gt;only 17 out of 167 Republicans voting&lt;/a&gt; voted to pass the bill. Every Democrat voted to pass it, and every single one of the 150 no votes came from the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is, I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; happy this finally passed. It will fund a lot of science research as well as educational efforts for the next few years. As Rep. Holt points out, science always pays off far more than you invest, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;. America will be better off and stronger because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;

Instead of just chucking it in the trash, or simply making fun of it (the guy made a spelling error, of course), she had to go out of her way to demonstrate that maybe the fellow was right. How? She turned it into an online poll, asking who was dumber, Brian or Greta. The fact that she used a poll made the answer obvious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gretawire.blogs.foxnews.com/why-does-brian-watch/"&gt;Who is dumber?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greta? 73%&lt;br&gt;
Brian for spending his time watching someone he thinks is dumb 27%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how it is going. Pile on if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't believe she did that. I know that if I ran a poll asking, "Is PZ a poopyhead?", the yes votes would run ahead of the no votes at least 10 to 1. Is she really that clueless about the nature of the internet beast?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/stupid_poll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/cTjegXGOWx8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275146725772"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=3027">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8574adc39e1c85fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Synthetic Biology"/><category term="The Tangled Bank"/><title type="html">Up for Discussion: Neanderthals and Synthetic Genomes</title><published>2010-05-29T14:47:22Z</published><updated>2010-05-29T14:47:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Loom/~3/vhceyiXXyNE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/05/29/up-for-discussion-neanderthals-and-synthetic-genomes/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two of my favorite bloggers, &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog"&gt;John Hawks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/oscillator/"&gt;Christina Agapakis&lt;/a&gt;, talk about the big genome news of recent weeks on Bloggingheads.

He also did groundbreaking work on the so-called “standard model” of particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weinberg’s written a number of popular and technical books, the most famous of which is probably &lt;em&gt;The First Three Minutes&lt;/em&gt;, recounting what physicists think happened at the moment (or, rather, nanoseconds after) the universe began.  He’s  a pretty vociferous atheist,  and gained infamy among accommodationists for writing one of the great mantras of new atheism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil—that takes religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just polished off Weinberg’s new collection of essays,&lt;em&gt; Lake Views&lt;/em&gt;, published by Harvard University Press.  (The name comes from Lake Austin, which his study faces.)  It gathers 25 essays written between 2001 and 2008 for magazines and journals, and has a few transcripts of his talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth a read, I think, but I wouldn’t &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; it (I took mine out of the library). It’s rather thin gruel, and, like Churchill’s pudding, lacks a theme.  The essays are diverse, and he’s put them in chronological order, which is a bit annoying. An essay on nuclear war, for instance, will be snuggled up to one on atheism, or Zionism, or Einstein.  One gets the impression that these pieces weren’t collected for any pressing reason, but simply to tidy up Weinberg’s &lt;em&gt;oeuvre&lt;/em&gt; since his last group of essays (&lt;em&gt;Facing Up&lt;/em&gt;, which was much better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorites in the new collection include his pieces on Einstein’s mistakes, a good description of the idea of multiverses and how it bears on the anthropic principle, and the longest essay, “What Price Glory,” on military history (one of Weinberg’s avocations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to dip into Weinberg’s short pieces, though, try &lt;em&gt;Facing Up&lt;/em&gt; first.  It has some great pieces, included a nice dismantling of Thomas Kuhn’s ideas about paradigm shifts, and a lot of wonderful descriptions of what modern physics has achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the better pieces in&lt;em&gt; Lake Views &lt;/em&gt;is the last, “Without God,” a transcript a talk Weinberg’s gave in 2008 to Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard.  He owns up to the difficulties of being an atheist (“Cicero offered comfort in &lt;em&gt;De Senectute&lt;/em&gt; by arguing that it was silly to fear death. After more than two thousand years his words still have not the slightest power to console us.”), and thinks that “sophisticated” theology, which tries to dispense with a tangible, easily understood God, will eventually erode religion in America:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The various uses of religion may keep it going for a few centuries even after the disappearance of belief in anything supernatural, but I wonder how long religion can last without a core of belief in the supernatural, when it isn’t about anything external to human beings.  To compare great things with small, people may go to college football games mostly because they enjoy the cheerleading and marching bands, but I doubt if they would keep going to the stadium on Saturday afternoons if the only things happening there were cheerleading and marching bands, without any actual football, so that the cheerleading and the band music were no longer &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he’s right, we should be praising Terry Eagleton and Karen Armstrong to the skies, but there’s the little matter of Islam, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misery loves company. But misery has to work in the morning so, you know, *ahem*, goodnight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfffft. Walking to work is so pedestrian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindenburg fire: it’s not the heat, it’s the humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet it’s almost impossible to get any motions passed at a meeting of horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB. Seriously dude, shut up. If you can’t follow the plot, ask your friend to explain it after the movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Austin Powers movie notwithstanding, I am pretty sure the original Goldmember would have been King Midas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second-last time, stop misusing the word “penultimate”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopes are great for seeing tiny things in 3D, but what if we want to see large things at full size, using photons instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names in this story have been changed to protect the innocent. Their father, Anthony Williams of Oakwood Blvd, however, was guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a seminar on how to diagnose ADD. The goddamn thing was like 20 minutes long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First a gasp of panic, then a sigh of relief, followed by a yawn of boredom, and finally a fart of complacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-star hotel, good. Three of those stars are glittery kindergarten-style stickers awarded to their best employee, not so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, remember that song by Chumbawumba that went “I get knocked down, but I get up again…”? (Ha ha enjoy, sucker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid is as stupid quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s right to force accountants to chauffeur people around. And I definitely don’t approve of calling them “taxies”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kid having fingernails pulled out wouldn’t scream exactly the same way each time, right? Whew, must just be the neighbor’s rooster then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ll all agree that, although less descriptive, “summer spooning” sounds much more romantic than “back ensweatening”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That chocolate cake just went straight to my thighs. Incidentally, does anyone know how to get chocolate cake stains out of dress pants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, using “soothing sounds of the rainforest” as the audio file for my alarm clock probably wasn’t the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How old am I? Let’s just say I remember when LEGO didn’t come with detailed instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw tabloid headline: “Pizza beats cancer”. Thought this may be the first rule in a new rock-paper-scissors game, but nothing beats pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They often label the men’s washroom “Gentlemen”, but in my experience it’s generally full of pricks and noisy assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elephants. Very nosy. But hippos. They’re the real bigmouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire market for vanilla cake seems to be based on the idea that it’s somehow less bad for you than chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not interested in the whole “speed dating” thing, but I could definitely go for “speed buffet food taking”. Hear that, lady?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and India have the most attractive women in the world. They also have the most ugly women. And the most men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no issue whatsoever with speedos or assless chaps — as long as they’re worn together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some claim excessive use of cell phones may cause brain cancer. So sad. Why couldn’t it be something much faster like heart attacks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing sounds less like an air conditioner and more like an air beater-into-submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner’s Law: The time taken to cancel a turn signal varies in proportion to the age of the driver. (Approx 1 minute per decade over 30).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the deep, dark jungle and all I got was this lousy t-shirt and malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed bumps should be called slow-down bumps. (I tells it like I sees it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha! Did you see that? I hit him right in the eye!” “Nice try. That’s his butthole.” (Simultaneous origin of bull’s eye AND bullshit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stamp collecting can make you both more interesting and less ignorant. As long as they’re stamps in your passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be better if airlines used reserved seating so that people didn’t have to rush to board the airplane every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a better idea. I’ll give you $800 for the plane ticket, and you throw in the $3 sandwich for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living with a woman means you can have lotion, baby oil, Vaseline, and Kleenex all in plain view and no one will think anything of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with a woman means the drain will never be clogged with your hair again. (Read: it will never be clogged with YOUR hair again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with a woman means never having to endure the sight of an empty flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with a woman means learning about new topics such as “accent pillows”, and that these can form the basis of entire conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gentlemen — the correct answer to the question “Want to see what I got at the fabric store?” is not a blank stare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whack-a-mole is a fun, harmless game. Unless you’re a mole. Or a dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember 1984. It wasn’t nearly as bad as all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re asking for my unbiased opinion, then you probably should go and look up what the words “unbiased” and “opinion” mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got worried when I read that bicycle seats can be very bad for men’s genitals. But trust me, you do a lot more damage without a seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wearing your heart on your sleeve may be fine, but wearing someone else’s heart anywhere on your clothes is never ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q-Tips company doesn’t care if you use them to clean your ears. Otherwise they’d make them bigger. Or have them play elevator music.&lt;/p&gt;

I knew I made my promise to myself not to write about vaccines again for at least a few days too soon! Whenever I do that, it seems, one of two things happens. Either something important happens that, having become, however it happened, the go-to blogger for commenting on the anti-vaccine movement, I can't ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing that happens whenever I make that promise to myself is that someone from the anti-vaccine movement writes something that's unintentional pure comic gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone named Curt Linderman, Sr. characterized the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/is_the_anti-vaccine_movement_fizzling.php"&gt;pathetically attended and totally pwned&lt;/a&gt; anti-vaccine American Rally for Personal Rights a "&lt;a href="http://www.autismtodayonline.com/2010/autism/the-american-rally-for-personal-rights/"&gt;huge success&lt;/a&gt;," even though his own inflated estimate of the attendance there was only 300. My rule of thumb from having observed events of this type for a while is that the actual attendance of a political rally is usually, at most, half of what the organizers trumpet the attendance to have been after the event. That would be about 150 or less, well within the range of estimates of the skeptics there. Add to that the picture of the volunteers and speakers, which number around 45, subtract the volunteers and speakers, and you're talking pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the single most giggle-worthy passage from the account, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While some websites run by unscrupulous individuals decided to misinform the public with the low estimates of those attending the mid week rally, numbers were essentially where we had expected them to be and this is apparent when you consider that the Chicago officials would have been riled had we underestimated the number and significantly more had shown up for the event. With more than 300 logins for the web based rally, the number of those viewing via the web should be placed at over 1500 considering that I know of a number of rally parties springing up....worthy numbers for a first time event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gee, you don't think he means li'l ol' Orac (among others), do you? &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;Skeptical Teacher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1015"&gt;Autism News Beat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/anti-vaccination-rally-chicago-il-aka-american-rally-for-personal-rights/"&gt;Jeremy Witteveen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/my-day-at-an-anti-vaccination-rally/"&gt;Jamie Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, take a bow too, you "unscrupulous" skeptics, you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if true, this passage unintentionally reveals something. If this passage is true (which I sincerely doubt), then it means that the organizers themselves didn't think they could draw very many people into a park in the heart of Chicago on a spring afternoon despite a "large number of volunteers that spent months on conference calls and logistics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I'll stop again for now and try to move on to other topics next week. I have a rare three-day weekend that doesn't demand huge amounts of work to enjoy, the last one for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait. Orac's typing hand is twitching over his keyboard. Julie Obradovic at Age of Autism is laying down nine Burning Man-sized straw men about supporters of science-based medicine and vaccines and then &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/the-difference-between-you-and-me.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;setting them on fire with napalm-grade burning stupid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The occasion is the Center for Inquiry's summer annual leadership conference, which brings in freethinking student leaders from across the country for workshops, lectures, and to finally get to know each other.

This is a blast from the past for me, in many ways, as I worked at the Center for Inquiry to organize student freethinkers back in 1999. (Matt Nisbet worked there too, at the time.) So going back to Amherst ten years later--as a speaker this time--is really something that stirs a bit.

Plus, it will be great to finally meet Stollznow and Price. I've been admiring their shows from a distance, and I hope now that we've all gotten our feet wet, we can try to collaborate and cross-pollinate a bit more.

More details can be found here....if you're a student freethinker, or are just generally interested, I hope you'll attend.

Let me highlight what I consider one of the most important problems. It's this: it explains too much. It explains everything, and so it explains nothing. What do I mean by this? If every problem can be solved by a single solution then the solution has too much explanatory power. It becomes a simplistic solution. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've already made this case with regard to Calvinism, where I quoted these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;"But is it always rational to accept a simpler theory? It is true that simpler theories always have greater explanatory scope. But there is a point where a theory can have too much explanatory power in which it explains everything, and actually doesn't really explain anything because there is no observation or fact which it cannot explain. Such a theory, having too much explanatory power ceases to be a simple theory and becomes simplistic." &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/07/calvinism-explains-everythingand.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are some fatal problems with regard to how a timeless bodiless Trinitarian personal God has always existed who created the universe in time and who never learned anything new. There are fatal problems for how such a God could create a material world and why he did so knowing that billions of his creatures would end up in hell. There are additional problems harmonizing the current concept of the Christian God with the tribal God we find in the Bible. There are even more problems when we ask how this God could become incarnate in Jesus and why his death on the cross saves us from sins. Additional problems are why this God chose to reveal himself in the ancient superstitious past where claims of miracles were abundant and hardly ever doubted before the rise of modern science. Still more problems concern why this God did not reveal himself such that his words would not be misunderstood by believers down through the centuries, which caused wars among Christians themselves. And there is the fatal problem of ubiquitous suffering, both among humans and animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all of these problems (and more) are answered simplistically with the God concept. You see, God is mysterious and so are his ways. Christians believe he knows what he's doing. He's beyond comprehension because he is God. He is infinite. We are finite. How can we expect to understand him? We can't. So he revealed enough about himself so that we should accept that he exists and that his ways are reasonable and good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Balderdash! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believers opine that just because we cannot comprehend a timeless bodiless personal existence of a trinitarian Supreme being doesn't mean such an existence is impossible since God is an infinite being. Okay. Possibly. They pontificate on each and every one of these problems with similar answers. Just because we cannot understand the incarnation, or the atonement, or why such a God created anything at all doesn't mean God does not have his good reasons for doing so. Okay. Possibly. Just because we find a tribal God in the Bible doesn't mean that an infinite God doesn't exist who was progressively leading believers to a more informed perspective on just who he is. Okay. Possibly. Just because we cannot understand how a perfectly good God can be reconciled with the total amount of human and animal suffering from the very beginning doesn't mean that such a God doesn't exist who knows what he's doing. Okay. Possibly. And the list of problems goes on and on. For each one of them their God concept is the answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians demand that the skeptic must show some logical impossibility with any and all of these problems. And skeptics have risen to this challenge seen in this book: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Impossibility-God-Michael-Martin/dp/1591021200?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;The Impossibility of God.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1591021200" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt; But Christians always seem to find some strange extremely remote &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; possibility that escapes these arguments. So they continue to believe and think it's still reasonable to do so even though to answer these arguments they must continually retreat to what I call the "mere possible" defense time after time; that so long as what they believe is &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; then it's probable even though this is a huge non-sequitur informal fallacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My claim is that the more often Christians must retreat to this defense in order to believe then the less likely their God exists. My argument is that for us to believe such a God exists we must know enough of his ways to conclude his ways are reasonable and good. But we don't. Not by a long shot. Not even close. Why would God create us with minds, ask us to use them, and not provide us with what we need to believe? I've already described what it would take for me to believe. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-would-convince-me-christianity-is.html"&gt;Why doesn't God provide any of this?&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that is the problem. This God concept ends up being a simplistic answer to all problems. It explains everything and so it explains nothing. It is non-answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6455648564404115666?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can bet my eyes widened when I read about that…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently, it’s all ok… because she worked at a Catholic school and they are allowed to do such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you dismiss this story because St. Edmond Catholic School in Iowa is a private, religious school and they have every right to fire non-Catholic teachers, read on.  &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100528/NEWS02/5280336/1001/NEWS/Catholic-school-fires-teacher-for-her-lack-of-belief-in-God"&gt;This is really a disturbing story&lt;/a&gt; and the headlines don’t do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Abby Nurre, 27, was hired last summer as an eighth-grade math teacher at St. Edmond Catholic School. In August, she responded to a Facebook members’ poll in which she was asked whether she believed in God, miracles or heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Nurre answered, “No.” Her answers then became part of her Facebook autobiography page, which was accessible only to her designated “friends.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, though, the information ended up in the hands of the school officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her Facebook page was accessible to designated friends and she had not authorized any students to access the page or the survey within, she testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On cross-examination, Paul Jahnke of the Iowa Catholic Conference pressed Nurre on her religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you deny that you are an atheist?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nurre testified, “I am not an atheist.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jahnke asked Nurre why she responded to the Facebook survey by saying she didn’t believe in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurre replied, “I feel that opinions on such things constantly change.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she’s not an atheist… and she actually &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; about religious issues enough to doubt what she hears.  The school wants none of this: asking questions is antithetical to what they teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all.  She also had the audacity to make a posting on &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnexus.org/"&gt;Atheist Nexus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In November, Nurre posted a comment to an online discussion forum, Atheist Nexus. In her post, she provided a link to a New York Times article that, as she described it, indicated the government had spent $2.3 million on prayer research in the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five weeks later, she was called to the office of Monsignor Kevin McCoy and handed a letter informing her that she was suspended for making “atheist statements in a public forum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCoy barred Nurre from school grounds. A few days later, without discussing the matter with Nurre, the school’s board of directors fired her for violating a policy that prohibits employees from advocating “principles contrary to the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogmatic is right.  Moral?  Hardly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice she didn’t say that the article was right or wrong, good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She just posted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she had to register for the site in order to do that and that was enough for the school officials to terminate her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It never occurred to me that teachers were limited in their professional and personal education to only church-approved sources of information,” she told the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s unfortunate that the school fires teachers for getting information from nonchurch sources, then showing that information on another Web site without comment or opinion. … Teachers are taxpaying citizens and are entitled to think, be informed and take action.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board voted a second time to fire her. The school and Iowa Catholic Conference then challenged Nurre’s request for unemployment benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this is the Catholic Church — no thinking allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absurd.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note how the entire article never once mentions her ability to teach math.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  We’re not talking about school officials who take education seriously.  We’re talking about people who are more worried about how Nurre’s alleged atheism might appear to parents than the quality of education she delivers to the students.  Maybe that’s what they think they have to do as a business, but if I were a parent, I’d never want my child going to a “school” like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many reasons not to send your children to a Catholic school: The teachers are not always certified in their subject area, the tuition simply isn’t worth it, the kids waste class time going through Catholic rituals like confession… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way I can justify sending your children to a Catholic school is if the public schools nearby are even worse.  But, in my experience, if you can afford to send your kids to a Catholic school, you’re probably living near some pretty damn good public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Edmond Catholic School is a joke.  They are sending a message to kids to not question what the Church says — Just smile and nod and never doubt the Church leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent children know better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, another interesting part of this story is that &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-ia-catholicteacherfi,0,5181044.story"&gt;the school &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; she wasn’t a Catholic&lt;/a&gt; when they hired her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nurre said when she was hired at St. Edmonds, she was asked if she was a Catholic. She said she wasn’t. At school, she attended Mass and participated in prayer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was fine with that. I’ve always done that,” she said. “I’m not an atheist. I’m not a Catholic. I’m not a Christian. I’m somewhere in between.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she still wants to be a teacher but that she no longer wants to work in a Catholic school.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it’s easy for me to say this when I have a job, but she’s better off not working there.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abby: &lt;em&gt;I hope you get a job at a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; school — One where they allow freedom of thought and where they let your private life remain private.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder: would school officials have fired her so easily if she had instead said Jainism made some sense? Or that Protestant church services were more exciting than Catholic ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brother Richard&lt;/strong&gt;, who runs Atheist Nexus, &lt;a href="http://www.atheistnexus.org/forum/topics/teacher-fired-because-of?commentId=2182797%3AComment%3A838381"&gt;adds on to those comments and explains what Atheist Nexus is really all about&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Would the school have fired Nurre if she was a member of a Protestant site, or one geared toward Buddhism? Would the board fire an employee for posting on a private website their use of birth control? Or does the school’s bigotry extend only to those free of supernaturalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for reasons such as this that Atheist Nexus exists. To give support and encouragement to nontheists and those questioning religious dogma. Only when nonbelievers, like the homosexual community before us, “come out” and demand respect and equality will this change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abby’s looking for a new teaching job and I hope she finds one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commenter on the &lt;em&gt;Des Moines Register&lt;/em&gt; site shared my frustration with this whole story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Who hasn’t questioned the church or God in their life? I hate the hypocrocy of the church. Question them and [you&amp;#39;re] fired. Molest children and get transferred. Question the church and get denied benefits. Fondle little boys and go meet the Pope!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What percentage of the congregation takes birth control? Has had an abortion? Does not confess? Only shows up on holidays? Fire all of them! Oh, but who is going to put money in the basket? Who is going to donate for the new pulpit? Who is going to support the business model? This is why churches should pay taxes. They are just a business…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… This teacher may someday be the best in her field and you lost out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, here’s why they call it a lion cut:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12687" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/lion-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="lion!" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/lion1.jpg?w=461&amp;amp;h=345" alt="" width="461" height="345"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually a little ball of fluff is left on the tail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12692" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/lioncut/"&gt;&lt;img title="lioncut" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/lioncut.jpg?w=455&amp;amp;h=341" alt="" width="455" height="341"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often the photographs of lion-cut cats make them look really cheesed off.  My theory for this (which is mine) is that the photos are taken right after the trip to the groomer, so the cat is upset.  Like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12695" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/funny-looking-shaved-cat/"&gt;&lt;img title="funny-looking-shaved-cat" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/funny-looking-shaved-cat.jpg?w=457&amp;amp;h=356" alt="" width="457" height="356"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12696" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/shaved-cat-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="shaved cat 2" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shaved-cat-2.jpg?w=452&amp;amp;h=301" alt="" width="452" height="301"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12697" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/shaved-cat/"&gt;&lt;img title="Shaved cat" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shaved-cat.jpg?w=450&amp;amp;h=301" alt="" width="450" height="301"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the lion cut makes a cat look like it’s wearing Uggs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12698" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/shaved-cat-1/"&gt;&lt;img title="Shaved Cat 1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shaved-cat-1.jpg?w=363&amp;amp;h=560" alt="" width="363" height="560"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh lion cut allows you to see the pigmentation of the cat’s skin.  White cats have pink skin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12699" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/shaved_cat_8/"&gt;&lt;img title="shaved_cat_8" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shaved_cat_8.jpg?w=434&amp;amp;h=277" alt="" width="434" height="277"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black ones have gray skin, presumably from the same melanins that darken the fur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12700" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/shavedcat4/"&gt;&lt;img title="shavedcat4" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shavedcat4.jpg?w=375&amp;amp;h=500" alt="" width="375" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a celebrity shaved cat.  This is Kitty Purry, pet of the estimable Katy Perry.  &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1243424/Katy-Perry-gives-cat-Kitty-Purry-dramatic-haircut.html"&gt;Perry gave Purry a lion cut&lt;/a&gt;, and sent out &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/xuyml"&gt;a famous tweet&lt;/a&gt; about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-12701" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/kitty-purry/"&gt;&lt;img title="Kitty Purry" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/kitty-purry.jpg?w=406&amp;amp;h=304" alt="" width="406" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget the videos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/-_ADHjaSWGs/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion cuts can sometimes have pleiotropic benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/caturday-felids-cool-cats/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/CnAz24MENm0/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is still under investigation by the Medicines &amp;amp; Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) but so little has been done in the last six months, I thought it was time to bring this heartless scam to public attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 19th September 2009, I got a heartbreaking letter from the mother of a woman who was suffering from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to draw your attention to Homoeopathic product advertised in one of the Multiple Sclerosis Magazines called” New Pathways” , A copy is enclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have purchased this product for my daughter who is suffering from MS and paid £3,750.00 for seven months’ supply to what is look like clear water in vials to be sprayed sublingually every day. After six months of regular use, no improvements was noticed in my daughter’s condition, if anything her condition is deteriorating.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer also enclosed a pamphlet that advertised Esperanza neuropeptide (the term homeopathic does not occur in this particular pamphlet).  Even by the standards of alternative medicine, it was truly jaw-dropping [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/esparanza.pdf"&gt;download the pamphlet&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/esperanza-flyer1.jpg" title="Enlarge the picture"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/esperanza-flyer1-s.jpg" alt="from flyer" width="500" height="165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the pamphlet brought news of a special offer.  The price of 12 months’ supply has been reduced from £6,759 to £5,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes you read that correctly.  They want £6,750 (US $12,500) for 12 vials, or £575 for a single vial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s in Esperanza Homeopathic Neuropeptide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a start it doesn’t seem to be homeopathic at all.  I wrote to Esperanza to ask what the homeopathic dilution was, but got no reply at all.   I do hope that the word ‘homeopathic’ has not been added merely to circumvent medicines regulations, (we all know that loopholes in the law can allow homeopaths to get away with murder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Esperanza &lt;a href="http://www.esperanzapeptide.net/trial.php"&gt;web site states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sublingual Homeopathic spray (Esperanza Homeopathic NeuroPeptide) contains a peptide (71 amino acid chain) at a concentration of 10 µg/ml. The daily dose is 6 µg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dose mentioned above suggests a vial contains about 20 ml (they don’t say), So at the single vial price that comes to an astounding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;£28,670 per litre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(at their rate of exchange that would be over US $53,000 per litre)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also signed up to get the Esperanza newsletter.  The newsletter they sent on 11 November 2009 (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Esperanza-email-11-Nov-2009-anon.pdf"&gt;see it here&lt;/a&gt;) describes the product as Esperanza NeuroPeptide Homeopathic Sublingual Spray.  In fairness, it does say it isn’t a &amp;quot;cure&amp;quot; (so you conveniently have to keep on taking it every day).  But it does quote Esperanza’s Scientific Director as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;This is the only drug that gives back function in MS. It affects ability to walk, motor function, pain, fatigue, speech, co-ordination and balance.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to read their &lt;a href="http://www.esperanzapeptide.net/"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt; quite carefully to realise that there are no proper trials whatsoever to back up these claims.  It is one of those sciencey-sounding sites that might well be convincing to people not accustomed to reading such stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that pretending that a treatment contains something when it doesn’t (homeopathy) is reversed in this case. They are pretending it contains nothing when it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newsletter quotes Gerry Gallagher, Esperanza’s Chief Executive Officer, as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Esperanza NeuroPeptide is derived from a protein called alpha-cobratoxin. This recognizes and attaches to the nicotinic receptor in the brain. In a specific patent-protected chemical process unique to Esperanza NeuroPeptide [sic].  This alpha-cobratoxin is systmatically[sic] changed to create a totally harmless amino acid end-product protein. It lacks measurable toxicity but is still capable of attaching to (and affecting) the nicotine receptors. This means patients cannot overdose and that the end-product is 100% safe and toxin-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alpha-cobratoxin is well known to anyone who works on neuromuscular transmission.  It binds very tightly indeed to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on muscle fibres and so blocks chemical neurotransmission.  This paralyses voluntary movement (including breathing) and so kills you (like curare, but more powerful).  There are other sorts of nicotinic receptors in the brain, though only one of them (alpha7) is blocked by things like cobra toxin.  This preparation is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cobra toxin (luckily) and its properties are unknown.  The claim that it still attaches to receptors but has no obvious effects seems absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters is that there is no research that shows any beneficial effect whatsoever in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case seemed so horrifying that I referred it immediately to &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790"&gt;Trading Standards&lt;/a&gt; on 1 October 2009.  Despite the fact that the TS officer concerned had an interest in the medical area, the outcome was zero.   No action was taken.  After some time arguing with Trading Standards, I eventually I referred the case to the MHRA (on 10 November 2009),  In fact they had already been asked about it by the Multiple Sclerosis Society,  The MHRA is quite clear that it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; homeopathic and action is likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.esperanzapeptide.net/"&gt;web site for Esperanza&lt;/a&gt; is no better.  All sorts of wild claims are made.  You can download a powerpoint show, but it won’t tell you anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The MHRA investigation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I submitted a complaint to the  MHRA on 10 November 2009, the fist sign of action was on 26 May 2010. I got a brief letter from an assessor in the MHRA’s Advertising Standards Unit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You may wish to know that the advertisement published in the MSRC magazine has been withdrawn. Esperanza Peptide Ltd has stated that the advertisement will not be repeated and they are not planning to run any more campaigns in the UK for 2010. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Enforcement Group are continuing to investigate this Company and will keep you updated. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a start but a pretty modest start.  Let’s hope that the MHRA will decide to prosecute.  The enforcement group tell me that, six months on, they are still investigating.  No idea when they’ll finish.  One thing, though, emerged early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 11th December 2009, the MHRA told me they agreed that the description as ‘homeopathic’ was inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA considers Esperanza a conventional medicinal product and under no circumstances would it ever be acceptable to regulate it under any of the UK homeopathic schemes. Esperanza would require a full Marketing Authorisation and if such an application was made,  it would have to be supported by full efficacy data based on the results of clinical trials.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exists no such efficacy data, so the company is surely in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The state of the law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is a real problem.  Laws that already exist are flouted regularly, with impunity.  Those who break  the law, get, at most, a mild rap on the knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=790"&gt;Consumer Protection Regulations (May 2008)&lt;/a&gt; make it illegal to claim that a product will benefit your health if you can’t produce evidence to justify the claim. That should be quite enough to regulate quacks (though it would put many of them out of business). The problem is that these admirable laws are barely enforced. Enforcement is the duty of Trading Standards Officers, and they just don’t do the job.   This is the response that I got from Trading Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . we were very sympathetic to the complainant, both of us sharing your own aversion to quack medicine. We looked at the options for action under sch 1 CPRs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17. Falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or malformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am prepared to accept that it is in principle possible to prove such a thing by, most likely, a succession of expert witnesses. However, there is little doubt that the company would provide a vigorous (and well funded) defence. As well as their own ‘experts’ there would likely be a long procession of people into the witness box telling their tale of how they were cured by the drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind the likely scenario for this: a magistrates court with a lay bench. Questions that must properly be addressed by ****shire Council include: what is the likelihood of success? What are the financial risks (with ****shire resident’s money)? What are the benefits to ****shire residents? Has any ****shire resident complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We concluded that there is in this particular case no proper grounds for us to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This response, to such a flagrant case, seems to me pathetic.  They decline to enforce the law because no MS sufferer in the local area has been harmed. The law does not require that they should have, but that’s the way Trading Standards works (or, rather, fails to work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for their ineffectiveness is that the organisation of Trading Standards is desperately out of date. They have not kept up with the internet age. They still work almost entirely via local offices, just as they did when their main job was to check the accuracy of weights on scales used to sell groceries. It is a &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt; that simply doesn’t work now that they are meant to deal with health frauds that are largely internet-based. One problem is that any particular office is unlikely to have anyone with the specialist knowledge to judge the truth or falsehood of claims that are made for ‘health’ products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search of &lt;a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/69c9484559b6af8374c5e687bc27fa19/companysearch?disp=1&amp;amp;frfsh=1275066268#result"&gt;Companies House for “Esperanza”&lt;/a&gt; shows the usual trail of dissolved companies but two are still in business, Esperanza London Ltd, (ground floor 25 Balham High Rd.) and Esperanza Peptide Ltd (Largs, Ayrshire).  They have moved HQ  to Grand Bahama (there’s a surprise) but since they appear on Companies House this should not prevent prosecution .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also quite unsatisfactory  that the duties of Trading Standards offices overlap heavily with those of the MHRA. In this instance, only the MHRA did anything, and that very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;

It's an unstable chemical element that is subject to radioactive decay. The amounts are small and it wouldn't be a problem but for the fact that one of the decay products is a gas at room temperature - a radioactive gas, radon. It seeps up through cracks in the rock and disperses into the atmosphere, unless it happens upon an enclosed space, such as a building, where it will accumulate. When radon decays it produces solid particles of radioactive polonium, bismuth and lead. These tend to cling to particles of dust and smoke in the air, and when you breathe these in, the heavy metals lodge in your lungs. There they decay, send out alpha radiation, and increase your risk of lung cancer. (The more smoke you breathe, the higher the radiation dose.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swedish authorities recommend a highest level of radioactivity in indoors air of 200 Becquerels per cubic metre. My wife saw to it that during the winter we had two little particle collectors hanging from the ceiling for four months, with bits of sticky tape inside grabbing a sample of the ambient dust. When they were analysed, it turned out that the radioactivity in our winter air was 270 Bq/m3. This needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to rule out was an unfortunate building material, &lt;i&gt;blåbetong&lt;/i&gt;, "blue concrete", which is a type of aerated autoclaved concrete. It was made from limestone and a carbon-rich slate and used up until about 1980, when it was realised that the slate contained enough uranium that the concrete blocks exude considerable amounts of radon. There's no blue concrete in our house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we called in a radon consultant. He came over with a fast measuring instrument that can give you a radon reading in ten minutes and proceeded to take four measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outdoors: 20 Bq/m3&lt;br&gt;
Bedroom: 140 Bq/m3&lt;br&gt;
Living room: 210 Bq/m3&lt;br&gt;
Crawl space: 1570 Bq/m3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summers we open doors and windows a lot more, which explains why much of our house is currently below the recommended max radioactivity level. But our crawl space is not a healthy place to be, at eight times the max value. The radon collects down there and seeps up into the house. Luckily the problem is easily fixed: we just need to put a small fan in one of the crawl space's air vents to suck the radon out of the enclosed space and into the atmosphere, and fresh air in. The municipality pays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Hrab just made an awesome videosong cover of the Yes song &lt;em&gt;Owner of a Lonely Heart&lt;/em&gt;. A videosong is, according to the band &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uolz7V12evc"&gt;Pomplamoose&lt;/a&gt;, “a new Medium with two rules: 1. What you see is what you hear (no lip-syncing for instruments or voice) [and] 2. If you hear it, at some point you see it (no hidden sounds).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all accustomed to seeing George in natty suits, but I must say that he is demonstrating fine fashion sense here. Also, keep an eye out for an ever-so-brief James Randi cameo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex is an historical concept but it remains a theoretical model. It is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease or health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They remind chiropractors that they must make sure their own beliefs and values do not prejudice the patient’s care, and that they must provide evidence-based care. Unfortunately, they define evidence-based care as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;clinical practice that incorporates the best available evidence from research, &lt;strong&gt;the preferences of the patient and the expertise of practitioners, including the individual chiropractor her/himself. &lt;/strong&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effectively allows “in my experience” and “the patient likes it” to be considered along with evidence, effectively negating the whole point of evidence-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

But when she accused Willis in the  church, here’s how the pastor at the church responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pastor heard Anderson’s allegations, he told her  that if she had “lived in the Old Testament,” she would have been  stoned to death for not reporting the attack sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He also said I had ‘allowed myself to be put in a compromising  situation,’ Anderson said. The pastor decided she needed to be  “church-disciplined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was completely humiliated,” Anderson said, her voice quavering at the  memory. “I hoped it was a nightmare I’d wake up from, and it wouldn’t  be true anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Just wow.&lt;/p&gt;

She answered “no,” which resulted in her being fired from her job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she’s out of a job because, as the school board put it, she violated  “a policy that prohibits employees from advocating principles contrary  to the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He died in 1939 when H.M. was just entering adolescence. Unlike H.M., this patient did not undergo radical resection surgery. In fact, he never underwent brain surgery at all. His contribution to neurology did not begin until after his death at the age of 76. In what was supposed to have been a routine autopsy, H.C. was discovered to have had no cerebellum (see pictured brain above). H.C. had a very rare neurological condition known as cerebellar agenesis. When I was in graduate school, I was taught that the neuroplasticity of the brain was so remarkable, that even a child born without his or her cerebellum could grow-up to have no deficits and live a normal life. As it turns out, that was only partly true. H.C. was in fact, not without deficits. His tale is recounted briefly in two articles from the March 2010 issue of Brain:&amp;quot;It was clear that there were indeed clinical signs included right external strabismus (i.e., misaligned eyes), slow and slurred articulation and an unsteady gait.&amp;quot; (1)However, he did live a &amp;quot;normal life&amp;quot;:H.C. &amp;quot;had employment, that he was able to work in a manual job and that his working life was not curtailed by his cerebellar agenesis.&amp;quot; (1)What is interesting about H.C. compared to H.M., is that H.C.&amp;#39;s agenesis was discovered only after he died. Very little clinical history about his life exists, making this story a great neurological detective case. Most of what is known about H.C. comes from hospital notes during his last years of life, just before he developed dementia:&amp;quot;The social history describes him as &amp;#39;single.&amp;#39; The notes contained a record of his assessment by a neurologist, Dr. Jacobson, who described him as &amp;#39;a simple man with some hearing loss and slow slurred speech; he has a fair memory for recent and remote events concerning himself, but with limited general knowledge. There is no hallucination or delusions nor emotional defect. He is clean in his habits and able to attend to his person. He is able to get around unassisted.&amp;quot; (1)The human brain is estimated to have approximately 85 billion neurons (2). The cerebellum, which is typically 1/4 the size of the rest of brain, contains a full 50% of all our neurons. If you pay close attention to the image above, you will notice that, in addition to not having a cerebellum, H.C. was also missing his pons, the bulbous structure that is typically adjacent to the cerebellum and is responsible for arousal and alertness.Many of the patients I have seen with cerebellar strokes typically have severe and irreversible deficits. While H.C. did have some cognitive and functional deficits, that he lived a full and functional life is nothing less than remarkable. His case is an example of how extraordinary the human brain actually is.I encourage you to read more about the mysterious case of H.C. here.Boyd, C. (2009).

&lt;p&gt;Many of us try to be as eco-friendly as our budgets allow. Green thinking probably has spread to a variety of areas in your life – shopping, eating, cleaning habits. But what about Fido or Mittens? Check out these tips on how to make your pet’s life more eco-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Check out what type of cat litter you buy; if it’s lumping clay, it could expose you to carcinogenic silica dust. Switch to one made from pine, wheat, or newspaper, like &lt;a href="http://swheatscoop.com/"&gt;Swheat Scoop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Make sure the flea or tick treatments you use aren’t toxic. They could contain pesticides that leave residue on your pet’s fur, and cause them to have brain or nervous system damage. Check out some natural treatments for animals &lt;a href="http://search.onlynaturalpet.com/search.aspx?avs%7CDepartment=Flea+%2f+Tick+Control&amp;amp;avs%7CPet+Type=Dogs&amp;amp;click=5&amp;amp;9gtype=search&amp;amp;9gkw=organic%20flea%20treatment%20for%20dogs&amp;amp;9gad=4803450179&amp;amp;gclid=CMCeyfe-9aECFcRM5Qodl0bIEg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Reconsider what your pet eats. Some pet foods contain chemical ingredients that aren’t listed, and could cause &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in your pet. Find natural food for dogs and cats at &lt;a href="http://www.castorpolluxpet.com/"&gt;Castor &amp;amp; Pollux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Harsh animal shampoos could have carcinogenic chemicals in them. Look for all-natural pet shampoos, like &lt;a href="http://www.vermontsoap.com/petwash.shtml"&gt;Vermont Soap Wash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Back to crap: Grabbing your dog’s poop with a plastic bag is just adding to the millions of plastic bags sitting in landfills. Get some &lt;a href="http://www.biobagusa.com/"&gt;Bio Bags&lt;/a&gt; – they’re completely biodegradable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. When you change your fish’s water, don’t dump it down the sink or toilet. You could introduce invasive species that lived in the fish water into the local ecosystem. Dump it on your lawn instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. That coral at the pet store would &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/look/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=look&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; awesome in your fish tank, but don’t cave. 50-70% of coral reefs worldwide are threatened by the export of coral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Do some research before you buy a fish. The aquarium fish trade threatens 1,500 species of fish and their ecosystems. Check out the &lt;a href="http://www.aquariumcouncil.org/"&gt;Marine Aquarium Council&lt;/a&gt;’s certification to ensure that your fish purchase isn’t leaving any underwater ecosystems in chaos – look for the MAC label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Cats love to hunt, but try to keep him indoors so he doesn’t kill birds and rodents. It may be natural, but it’s not exactly a green practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Make sure your pet products are BPA-free; choose bowls made out of metal, ceramic, or porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;

To me, that&amp;#39;s incomprehensible. When I was young, I assumed that the concept of &amp;quot;tempting fate&amp;#39; was a poetic metaphor. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that some people take it literally!

Jonathan Abramowitz and colleagues, at the University of North Carolina, have done a nice little study into the differences between Protestants and nonbelievers in attitudes towards tempting fate. Technically, this is actually &amp;#39;thought-action fusion&amp;#39; - a cognitive bias that occurs when people believe that thinking is equivalent to doing, and that thinking can make certain events more probable. It&amp;#39;s related to obsessive-compulsive disorder.

What they did is to sit people down and ask them to think about a close relative. Then they were presented with two sentences which they had to copy, inserting the name of said relative:

&amp;quot;I hope  has a car accident today&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;I hope I have sex with &amp;quot;

Then they were asked about how the task made them feel, was the thought morally wrong, did it make them anxious, and did they think the event was more likely to happen as a result? All this was rated on a 1-100 scale.

The Protestants thought the sex thing was very wrong (giving it 98), the nonbelievers less so (only 81). But neither group thought it was going to happen, even though the thought had been seeded. 

For the car accident, things were different. Here the Protestants felt twice as strongly that merely thinking about it made it more likely to happen.

After the test, the participants were told that they could do anything they wanted to reduce or cancel the effects of writing or thinking about the sentence. The results were fascinating.

As you can see in the graph, the Protestants were much more likely to try to neutralise the words - typically by doing things like tearing up the paper, scribbling over the words, or flipping the paper over.

The researchers think this is because Christian theology encourages thought-action fusion. It crops up in many popular bits of the bible - like the commandment against coveting, and Jesus&amp;#39; warnings that lust is the same as adultery and that hating your brother is equivalent to being a murderer. What&amp;#39;s more, other studies have found that more religious people do indeed show more thought-action fusion.

But I&amp;#39;m not so sure. I suspect it&amp;#39;s the other way round. To me, it seems more likely that this is yet another of those cognitive predispositions that just make religion seem more plausible. I suspect that the reason I am an atheist is that this way of thinking about the world just seems downright alien to me.

What do you think?

The original picture (minus the labels) was taken from a general biology textbook to illustrate detour problems. We look at that and think, “That’s easy. Run around the post. Silly dog.”

Dogs turn out to be fairly bad at detour problems. Squirrels, I understand, solve such problems in a heartbeat, given that they have evolved to navigate complex three-dimensional environments as they leap from branch to branch on trees. But dogs and squirrels are so distantly related and have such different ecologies that one being better than the other doesn’t tell us all that much informative. 

Dogs, for instance, are domesticated animals. Domestication is often thought to make animals... well... stupid. Domestic animals often have smaller brains than their wild counterparts. Further, domestic dogs have social relationships with their owners; dogs tend to look at their owners when they experience problems solving a problem.

Smith and Litchfield pick up on some previous studies that showed wolves tended to do better on detour tasks than domestic dogs. They predicted that the same should be true of another kind of wild dog, Australian dingoes. They also predicted that dingoes would not look at humans when solving the problem.

To make a long story short, the dingos breezed through the tasks, and having humans around provided no particular advantage. Indeed, only one dingo ever even looked at a human when doing the task.

Are dingoes the super-geniuses of the dog world? The authors don’t think that that dingoes are especially bright; they really do think dogs have been made dumber by domestication. They write:

It is unclear whether domestic dogs have lost the ability to work independently to solve problems, or whether they are simply hindered or handicapped by their close relationship with humans.

But before closing out, I have to note that domestic doesn’t always mean dumb in spatial abilities. A little earlier this year, Lewejohann and colleagues tested domestic guinea pigs in the Morris water maze, a standard learning task for small mammals, against wild cavies, the original stock guinea pigs arose from. The authors here mention in the abstract that guinea pigs have smaller brains than cavies (but provide no reference – grrr).

To once again cut a long story short, the guinea pigs did better at learning the Morris water maze task than the cavies. 

Of course, there are differences in these two spatial tasks. Traditionally, the detour task is thought to require some level of insight, while the Morris water maze doesn’t. But the guinea pig study certainly helps to show you can’t assume all the domestic animals are going to do worse than their wild counterparts.

Even if that is the case for dogs and dingoes.

We’re officially taking off for a long, leisurely three days, filled with all of the above, and more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="455523572_849b5f08fd" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/05/455523572_849b5f08fd-465x445.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="445"&gt;Go to the Beach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where else would we be on Memorial Day? Just remember to pack a &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/vitamin-a-in-sunscreen-could-give-you-cancer-here-are-21-natural-sunscreens-that-wont/"&gt;safe, natural sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;. (Photo: Flickr user Balaji.P)&lt;/p&gt;

Long weekends were made for sleeping late, and that’s what we plan to do. Want to boost your slumber? Tell yourself you’re super-fit: Supposedly, it will &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/fitness-and-sleep-whats-the-real-connection/"&gt;help you get a better night’s rest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s nothing like a good restaurant – whether it’s your neighborhood pizza spot or the best new restaurant in town. And there’s also nothing like paying the check yourself (we don’t believe in following all &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/relationships-5-dating-rules-to-break/"&gt;dating rules&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

That’s it. Just eat lobster.&lt;/p&gt;

No, we don’t expect it to be amazing, but we do think it might pass the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/the-bechdel-test-of-women-in-movies-video-of-the-day/"&gt;Bechdel Test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Massage, facial, or &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/look/fanny-facials-natural-at-home-beauty-treatments-for-your-butt/"&gt;butt facial&lt;/a&gt; – going to spas is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

What’s remarkable about this observatory is that &lt;strong&gt;it’s mounted in a hole in the side of a 747!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe me? Check. This. Out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/images/content/446828main_ED10-0080-03c_1600-1200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/sofia_plane.jpg" alt="sofia_plane" title="sofia_plane" width="610" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click any of the images here to embiggen.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that ginormous square hole in the back of the plane? That’s where the telescope sits, looking out at the sky. Why put it in a plane? Because SOFIA looks in the mid to far infrared, and observations like that are impossible from the ground. Water vapor in the air absorbs the kind of infrared light seen by SOFIA, but by the time you go up to about 10 km (35,000 feet) you’re above 99% of the Earth’s water vapor. That little bit left does still absorb the light, but a telescope at that altitude receives about 80% of the IR an orbiting observatory would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, amazingly, they cut a big hole in the side of a modified 747 and stuck a telescope in it. A big one: SOFIA sports a 2.5 meter (8 foot) mirror, which is bigger than Hubble’s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample of what it saw:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/images/content/458798main_JupiterComposite_unlabeled_1600-1200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/sofia_firstlight_jupiter.jpg" alt="sofia_firstlight_jupiter" title="sofia_firstlight_jupiter" width="610" height="349"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, Jupiter. On the left is an image in visible light, and on the right the SOFIA image. It’s a composite of three infrared colors: 5.4 (colored blue in the image), 24 (green), and 37 microns (red). Your eye can see wavelengths only as long as about 0.7 microns, so these represent wavelengths well outside what we can see. See the stripe on the left that’s reddish? In the infrared it’s brighter, because the gas in that belt is transparent to infrared light and we can see deeper into Jupiter’s atmosphere where it’s warmer. Note that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/12/how-will-jupiter-hold-up-his-pants/"&gt;the other belt is still missing&lt;/a&gt;, in the visible &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; infrared. Whatever is blocking the light from that belt is opaque to both our eyes and SOFIA’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/images/content/459529main_M82_labeledHR_full_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/sofia_m82.jpg" alt="sofia_m82" title="sofia_m82" width="300" height="217"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;SOFIA also took a look at the nucleus of the nearby weird galaxy &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/images/content/459529main_M82_labeledHR_full_full.jpg"&gt;M82&lt;/a&gt;, which is undergoing a burst of star formation, and is lousy with thick dust that blocks visible light. SOFIA peers through that dust, revealing the star factories hard at work in the center of that galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to preliminary reports, SOFIA is performing perfectly, and getting great observations at a far, far cheaper price tag than putting something in orbit. We still need telescopes in orbit to do other work — some IR is still absorbed even at that height — but SOFIA will make terrific achievements. It also has &lt;a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Edu/edu.html"&gt;a robust educational arm&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;em&gt;taking as many as 200 teachers per year up on observation flights!&lt;/em&gt; If you’re an educator and interested in this, contact the team at SOFIA. You may just qualify to get the airplane ride of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

Fools stand on their island opportunities and look toward another land. There is no other land, there is no other life but this." -&lt;i&gt;Henry David Thoreau&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Maybe for you, Henry.  But a century and a half later, we are explorers of &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; other lands, including this one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/Mars_atmosphere.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/Mars_atmosphere-thumb-500x561-49994.jpg" width="500" height="561" alt="Mars_atmosphere.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2004, two rovers landed on Mars, Spirit and Opportunity.  And while Spirit has gotten all the press with its trials and tribulations, Opportunity has quietly been, well, exceeding all reasonable expectations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/marsOpportunity.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/marsOpportunity-thumb-500x400-49996.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="marsOpportunity.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunity landed in January of 2004, slated to run for 90 days.  Its landing site was in Eagle Crater, shown below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/800px-Opportunity_-_Cratera_Eagle.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/800px-Opportunity_-_Cratera_Eagle-thumb-500x279-49998.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="800px-Opportunity_-_Cratera_Eagle.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rovers on Mars pose a unique challenge for their controllers.  Even using radio-control, it takes Opportunity somewhere around 20 minutes to respond to a command!  Why's this?  Radio waves -- a form of light -- travel incredibly fast: at the &lt;i&gt;speed of light&lt;/i&gt;, or about 300,000 kilometers per second.  Which means they can reach the Moon in just over a second.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/inner%20solar%20system.PNG.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/inner%20solar%20system.PNG-thumb-500x479-50000.png" width="500" height="479" alt="inner solar system.PNG.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mars is &lt;i&gt;waaaay&lt;/i&gt; farther away than the Moon is from us.  Mars varies between about &lt;b&gt;70 and 370 million kilometers&lt;/b&gt; away from Earth, meaning that it could take over &lt;i&gt;20 minutes&lt;/i&gt; for Opportunity to receive a signal such as, "Stop!  Or you'll fall into that crater!"  So Opportunity has a great robot brain, allowing it to make its own decisions when faced with a huge variety of situations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it also relies on commands to tell it where to go.  Originally designed for three months and a 600 meter journey, Opportunity has now been up and running for over &lt;b&gt;six years&lt;/b&gt;, and has traveled over &lt;b&gt;20 kilometers&lt;/b&gt;!  What are some of the highlights?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/1500px-MarsEndurance.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/1500px-MarsEndurance-thumb-500x98-50002.jpg" width="500" height="98" alt="1500px-MarsEndurance.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endurance crater&lt;/b&gt;.  Opportunity, despite worries that it would never get out, drove straight into Endurance crater, exploring the different layers of sediment,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/Burns_cliff.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/Burns_cliff-thumb-500x301-50006.jpg" width="500" height="301" alt="Burns_cliff.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;found hematite spheres, evidence of past water on Mars and &lt;i&gt;possibly&lt;/i&gt; of past life as well,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/Blueberries_eagle.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/Blueberries_eagle-thumb-500x434-50004.gif" width="500" height="434" alt="Blueberries_eagle.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; got itself out of the crater, and kept going!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next year, 2005, Opportunity went and found its original heat shield, and know what it found next to it?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/PIA07269-Mars_Rover_Opportunity-Iron_Meteorite.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/PIA07269-Mars_Rover_Opportunity-Iron_Meteorite-thumb-500x499-50008.jpg" width="500" height="499" alt="PIA07269-Mars_Rover_Opportunity-Iron_Meteorite.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first meteorite ever discovered on another planet!&lt;/b&gt;  Known by the "creative" name &lt;i&gt;Heat Shield Rock&lt;/i&gt;, this is confirmed to be an iron meteorite!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunity has overcome a host of problems, ranging from escaping from a sand dune (it dug itself out) to shoulder problems (it now permanently has its arm deployed and seems to be working fine) to accumulating too much dust on its solar panels (it was helped by a simple gust of wind).  And it's gone on to visit a whole host of craters, including Erebus crater,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/800px-Payson_Ridge%2C_Erebus_Crater%2C_Mars_Opportunity_Rover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/800px-Payson_Ridge%2C_Erebus_Crater%2C_Mars_Opportunity_Rover-thumb-500x150-50010.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="800px-Payson_Ridge,_Erebus_Crater,_Mars_Opportunity_Rover.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vostok crater,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/PIA08778.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/PIA08778-thumb-500x194-50016.jpg" width="500" height="194" alt="PIA08778.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and -- perhaps most famously -- Victoria crater, below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/victoria-crater.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/victoria-crater-thumb-500x337-50018.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="victoria-crater.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it might just be me, but one of the most beautiful sights I've seen is the rover looking back at its own footprints in the Martian soil.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/112360main_site_B50_cyl-516.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/112360main_site_B50_cyl-516-thumb-500x326-50012.jpg" width="500" height="326" alt="112360main_site_B50_cyl-516.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might look like it's already come a long way, and it definitely has. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/512px-Opportunity_rover_traverse_map_sol_1487.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/512px-Opportunity_rover_traverse_map_sol_1487-thumb-500x584-50014.jpg" width="500" height="584" alt="512px-Opportunity_rover_traverse_map_sol_1487.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's nothing compared to what lies ahead.  With over 20 km under its belt, Opportunity is undertaking its most ambitious journey ever: a &lt;i&gt;12 km journey&lt;/i&gt; to the gigantic crater Endeavour, estimated to take &lt;b&gt;two more years&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/772px-Endeavour_Crater_Annotated_2009-03-07.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity/772px-Endeavour_Crater_Annotated_2009-03-07-thumb-500x388-50020.jpg" width="500" height="388" alt="772px-Endeavour_Crater_Annotated_2009-03-07.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; Endeavour is compared to Victoria (with the tiny yellow text in the image above).  Endeavour, if Opportunity gets there, will be &lt;i&gt;by far&lt;/i&gt; the largest crater ever visited by a rover.  And I think it's going to get there; maybe as early as late 2011!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you hear someone talk about the Land of Opportunity, remember my favorite rover, hundreds of millions of miles away on Mars, already scoping out the next frontier!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275081087235"><id gr:original-id="http://bigthink.com/ideas/20310">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e19183f98850001</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Study: People Think Less of Working Moms (And of Their Children)</title><published>2010-05-28T16:06:05Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T16:06:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/pwGkVtSMecA/20310" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/20310"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Americans may talk a good game about &amp;quot;work-life balance,&amp;quot; but according to this study, they&amp;#39;re biased against working mothers.  More surprisingly, those who liked working moms less also liked the children of those mothers less.

For her Master&amp;#39;s degree, Jennifer Livengood, who graduated this month from Kansas State University, asked 96 students to rate mothers and children after hearing them interact with their kids on an audiotape and watching a brief video.  The raters knew in advance which mothers worked only in the home, which ones had full-time jobs, and which ones worked part-time.  As Livengood told this interviewer, she thought she&amp;#39;d find differences in how people reacted to each type of parent.  She didn&amp;#39;t.  Instead, though, she found one consistent pattern: her volunteers rated the fully employed mothers as less competent; their relationships with their kids as more troubled; and the kids themselves as less likable.

It has long been known that &amp;quot;irrelevant&amp;quot; facts have an impact on teachers&amp;#39; expectations for kids.  This study, for example, showed that the same academic file would get different ratings from teachers if the accompanying photo showed a nice-looking kid than it would if the child was unattractive: The teachers had higher expectations for the intelligence, popularity, and educational prospects of the good-looking pupils.  And this one found that kindergarten teachers expect short boys to be less academically capable than typically-sized ones. Moreover, there&amp;#39;s a huge body of research showing that teachers&amp;#39; expectations have a big impact on kids—the &amp;quot;Pygmalion effect&amp;quot; that suggests a kid expected to do well will do better than a kid expected to be dull.

All of which makes me wonder what would happen if someone were to test the effect on teachers of knowing that a pupil&amp;#39;s mother is a &amp;quot;working mom&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;stay-at-home.&amp;quot;  Livengood&amp;#39;s study would suggest that there&amp;#39;d be an effect.  And that, despite the lip service we all pay to hardworking mothers, that effect wouldn&amp;#39;t be pretty.

For more on teacher-bias studies, here are the two I mentioned (one among the earliest, the other recent):

Here's something I agree with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anthony Griffiths (University of British Columbia, Vancouver) places more emphasis on core principles than on specific applications: “The goal is to show how genetic inference is made ... hence overall the emphasis is more on process than the discoveries.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's right. A textbook should emphasize concepts and principles and not facts. The goal is to show students how all of the knowledge we have fits into a coherent picture of the subject. Genetics, like all sciences, is based on models that represent the consensus view of the scientists in the field. It's important for students to see that these models are internally consistent and compatible with biology and biochemistry and all other sciences. It's important that students realize that there may be some controversy in the discipline but that they need to learn how to sort it out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next paragraph says, ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Scott] Hawley also places a heavy emphasis on core topics, because he “factor[s] in heavily the concept that so-called facts can be pretty ephemeral in science.” As Hawley explains, “Many of the ‘facts’ I was taught in college are either irrelevant now or wrong. For example, I heard many lectures as an undergrad asserting that a huge part of the genome was useless ‘junk’. We no longer look at things that way.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm looking forward to seeing the next edition of &lt;i&gt;The Human Genome&lt;/i&gt; by Julia Richards and Scott Hawley. It will be interesting to see what principles and concepts they advance to explain the absence of junk in our genome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the things textbook authors have to careful of is discarding solid, well-established, models (like junk DNA) based on the results of a few modern experiments. Yes, it's true that new discoveries often overthrow old concepts, but it also true that when new "facts" disagree with established models it's usually the new facts that turn out to be wrong. The idea that theories are frequently overthrown by "nasty little facts" is a myth.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rejecting the concept of junk DNA has consequences that will be difficult to handle in the next edition. It means re-writing the sections on the C-value Paradox, transposons (especially defective transposons), selfish DNA, pseudogenes, and genetic load. Also, the explanation for why this DNA is functional is going to have serious ramifications for other topics. I can't imagine how they'll put together a coherent picture of modern genetics if they reject junk DNA.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a good genetics textbook then here&amp;#39;s my advice. Buy the one that supports the idea of copious amounts of junk in our genome and explains why it has to be junk. Ignore any textbook that rejects the notion of junk DNA—it will probably have other things wrong as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thanks to a friend who alerted me to the article in The GSA Reporter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-8168657407155097198?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275078294800"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/05/curiouser_and_curiouser.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ac99e7acc93e4a94</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">A cruel hoax</title><published>2010-05-28T18:07:47Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T18:07:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/3acwTjNrC-w/curiouser_and_curiouser.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/05/curiouser_and_curiouser.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As summer approaches and people spend more time outdoors, many parts of the country will start to see cases of Lyme disease.  It is carried by deer ticks and is especially common in the Northeast.  Tick bites often go unnoticed, but the rash of Lyme disease is pretty characteristic and occurs in about 70-80% of those who are infected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2010/05/curiouser_and_curiouser/erythema_migrans_phixr.jpg" width="350" height="521" alt="erythema_migrans_phixr.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Erythema migrans&lt;/i&gt;, the typical rash of Lyme disease.  &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Erythema_migrans_-_erythematous_rash_in_Lyme_disease_-_PHIL_9875.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Source.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It's easily cured with antibiotics, but if untreated can have significant complications, such as arthritis, and various neurologic problems.  As most of my readers know, there is also a movement that supports a diagnosis called &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/05/lyin_about_lyme.php"&gt;"chronic Lyme disease"&lt;/a&gt; (CLD), which is, in most cases, not related to Lyme disease at all.&lt;div&gt;   

&lt;p&gt;The controversy regarding CLD can get a bit bizarre, but the core reality is that real people are suffering, and real people are being misled.  When a set of protean and debilitating symptoms are mislabeled as CLD, other diagnoses and treatments are left behind, and patients are often subjected to invasive and ineffective treatments.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who practice science-based medicine are often the targets of the CLD activists, and CLD activists are often our targets.  I am very critical of health care professionals  who mislead patients (intentionally or otherwise), and I receive plenty of hate mail from readers who think I'm being dismissive of their suffering.  But I am not critical of patients who believe they have this disease.  They are the victims of this controversy.  And when the arguments and strategies get ugly, it is they who suffer.  That is why I was especially angered by the email I received earlier this week.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;I received this email in the account I use for blogging.  Here is the full text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Open Letter to the Mental Health Community from the Infectious Diseases Society of America

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
May 24, 2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Delusional Chronic Lyme Syndrome (DCLS) affects tens of thousands of new victims every year.  This debilitating mental illness is destroying the emotional and financial livelihood of families across our country.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), we see firsthand the damage inflicted by this illness.  Its sufferers frequently seek medical help from our member's practices;  however, we are powerless to cure its underlying roots, as this mental illness exists well outside our domain knowledge of pathogens and human infection.  Therefore, we are strenuously imploring the mental health community to take up research action in earnest.  After our Lyme disease treatment review panel concluded last month, it is now indisputably self-evident that DCLS has reached epidemic proportions and its yearly growth rate is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical duration, demographic breadth, and geographical extent of this mass psychogenic illness is a fascinating and unprecedented event in the history of our country, perhaps in the history of mankind.  It has persisted for four decades, affects all ages, and exhibits an intriguing geographic clustering phenomenon.  The intensity of its delusions drives sufferers to such extremes as self-mutilation via catheterization and sometimes suicide.  Currently, there is no formal diagnostic classification or treatment regimen for DCLS.  Meanwhile, this is empowering opportunistic medical doctors to prescribe improper and costly pharmaceutical treatment. This only furthers delays patients from seeking out the mental health professionals they so desperately need. Unfortunately, general awareness within the mental health field is virtually nonexistent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As president of the IDSA, I bear some responsibility for this ignorance, by not encouraging more cross-discipline pollination of our medical information.  As this crisis has illuminated, the IDSA has not been true to its stated core value to "promote collaboration and cooperation among other professional colleagues."  In response, I passionately pledge to our members and public constituents to reverse this myopic trend within our esteemed organization.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDSA member, Dr. Gary Wormser, has been a tireless crusader in promoting awareness of this emerging illness.  I owe him immense gratitude for keeping true to his values as a physician in the face of sometimes caustic opposition to his fresh ideas.  We beseech mental health researchers to carry on the torch ignited by Dr. Wormser and create pervasive, national recognition for this destructive disorder.  By doing so, you will bring hope and compassion to those afflicted by this strange and insidious illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To actualize this crucial transfer of information, the IDSA will be hosting free workshops on DCLS for mental health professionals at our upcoming annual meeting.  This meeting will be hosted on October 21st through 24th, 2010 in Vancouver, Canada.  We look forward to bringing the mental health community up-to-date on all relevant research and known data for DCLS.  For more information, please contact the DCLS workshop coordinator at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard J. Whitley, MD &lt;br&gt;
President, Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what the purpose of this email is (and &lt;a href="http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=16625"&gt;it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; from the IDSA&lt;/a&gt;).  If it is a joke, it is a cruel one.  It seems to me more likely, though, that this was written by a chronic Lyme activist as a piece of "false flag" agitprop.  It also seems to particularly target Dr. Wormser, a Lyme disease expert who has worked on IDSA Lyme disease guidelines in the past.  Wormser has been the target of barely comprehensible hate-filled rantings on various chronic Lyme disease websites.  I don't think this is a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this as a "Dr. Wormser and the IDSA think all the chronic Lyme folks are crazy," something they most assuredly do not believe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.idsociety.org/lymediseasefacts.htm"&gt;This is what the IDSA actually says &lt;/a&gt;about chronic Lyme disease:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In rare cases, people who have been diagnosed with Lyme disease and properly treated have lingering symptoms, typically generalized pain, joint pain and fatigue.  These symptoms have been interpreted by some to suggest the presence of chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection.

&lt;p&gt;However, an extensive review of scientifically rigorous studies and papers available to date, has determined that there is no convincing biologic evidence to support a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease after completion of the recommended treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that patients with persistent symptoms are suffering, but many report non-specific symptoms that also are associated with a number of other medical conditions. To be certain they receive the proper medical care, people who continue to have symptoms that persist after appropriate antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease should talk to their physicians about whether the original diagnosis of Lyme disease was accurate or if they may have a different or new illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CLD activists would like to paint the medical community as a gang of heartless and cruel  thugs beholden to...I don't know, someone bad, though.  The truth is somewhat different, and it appears that they are now trying to create their own truth.  By and large, doctors are compassionate and became doctors to help people.  We recognize that people are suffering, and also recognize that inventing a diagnosis and treating people improperly does not help.  But helping someone who has been given a fake diagnosis can be a daunting task, and it is not made easier by cruel hoaxes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/3acwTjNrC-w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275076819639"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/oh_the_inanity_the_dalai_lama.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f6a0566497a82b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Oh, the inanity!

It&amp;#39;s been a sad week for the godly, given that their paladins are all such flabby purveyors of tepid tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, let us consider the Dalai Lama, revered all around the world because he&amp;#39;s such a nice guy and is always smiling — and I agree that he is an awfully nice fellow, considering that he&amp;#39;s the representative of a medieval theocracy. He has an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/opinion/25gyatso.html?hp"&gt;op-ed in the NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, sadly, which reveals that behind his happy face is a bubble of confused cortex. &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/grayling-on-the-dalai-lama/"&gt;Anthony Grayling has already dealt with the core of his argument&lt;/a&gt;, that the many faiths are all facets of one truth, which is ragingly dishonest. The only equality between them is their entirely comparable falsehood — while there are relatively few ways to answer a question correctly, there is endless diversity in error, and that&amp;#39;s all we&amp;#39;re seeing…swarms of priests vigorously asserting that their weird and substanceless take on the universe is the one truth. And no, you aren&amp;#39;t going to arrive at the truth by splitting the difference between the inmates of an asylum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to focus on one other assertion the Dalai Lama made. What is the central core of all religions? Compassion. I disagree, of course, since the religions I get hammered with day after day here in the US are all militant, evangelical, aggressively hegemonical faiths, and compassion isn't what you see if you are confronted by them. Even their putative compassionate outreach in such things as missionary work are often attempts at cultural conquest. That compassion business is just a tool to win over minds for the Lord/Prophet/Messiah/Cult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also…what is uniquely religious about compassion? I don&amp;#39;t have to be a Muslim to give to the poor, I don&amp;#39;t have to be a Christian to abstain from excess. You don&amp;#39;t have to believe in ghosts to be kind, and what Tenzin Gyatso is doing is more of that hegemonical impulse — he&amp;#39;s seen something he likes, so he rushes to land on it and plant the sacred flag of religion on it, declaring this the property of all the holy people of the world…without noticing all us pagans and infidels already occupying it. Lama go home! We don&amp;#39;t need you, or your pious ilk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there's that fellow Francisco Ayala, who apparently has been emboldened by that generous Templeton Prize to babble vacuously and frequently. He has two pieces out. The &lt;a href="http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/3073/full"&gt;first is in Standpoint&lt;/a&gt;, some rag affiliated with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/not_the_social_affairs_unit_ag.php"&gt;ghastly Social Affairs Unit&lt;/a&gt;. Does Ayala know this is the kind of magazine that will blithely claim that &lt;a href="http://standpointmag.co.uk/cosmos-may-10-the-ascent-of-man-evolution-john-martin"&gt;"Evolution describes a linear progression from the amino acid to man of inevitable increasing complexity"&lt;/a&gt;, and publishes &lt;a href="http://standpointmag.co.uk/cosmos-August"&gt;apologists for Intelligent Design creationism like Steve Fuller&lt;/a&gt;? At least his drivel is in good company. I was primed with contempt by the first two lines of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can one believe in evolution and God? Some people of faith and some scientists agree: "No." They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strawmanning &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt;? That's what someone like Ken Ham says, all right, but that's &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; what the pesky New Atheists have been saying at all. Of course you can believe in evolution and gods. People are not either 100% right or 100% wrong, but can actually be &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; about one thing and &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; about another. Shocking, I know. It seems to be news to Francisco Ayala, though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is pure noise in which he mentions internal contradictions within the Bible, but excuses them as irrelevant, and mentions other erroneous factual statements about the world, but says it is OK because the Bible is not a science textbook, and the authors did not intend to accurately describe the natural world. He recites the usual cliches about how it's a book that is supposed to teach us how to live, how to get to heaven, and the purpose of your life. Which, of course, makes it &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt;. Has Ayala read that book? It's a cacophony of vileness, with god's chosen people raping and murdering for their land, god going off into peevish snits in which he tortures and massacres people, and your purpose is to win a place as god's eternal slave in a 'paradise' where you will spend all your time praising the supreme tyrant. It's a horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Ayala wants to draft science to prop up god's evil regime. The problem of evil is no problem for god, because it's all evolution's fault!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution is not the enemy of religion but, rather, it can be its friend, because it accounts for disease, death, and the dysfunctions and cruelties of living organisms as the result of natural processes, not as the specific design of God. The God of revelation and of faith is a God of love and mercy, and of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I choose to force you to slave for me and follow my orders with a whip and a gun, I still get to be the good guy, because it isn't &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; doing all the harm — it&amp;#39;s my weapons. I love my weapons, they are my great good friend, taking all the blame and still allowing me to reap the fruits of my methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is Ayala claiming that evolution is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a product of god's actions? Or is he just a goddamned dimwitted airhead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayala's second article is just as bad. What he claims is that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2010/may/28/religion-science-richard-dawkins"&gt;religion has nothing to do with science — and vice versa&lt;/a&gt;. It's that tired old NOMA garbage, with none of the graceful language of SJ Gould to soften me up. It's simply a series of repeated assertions that science is excluded from decisions about values or meaning, while religion is excluded from saying anything about the natural world, and he allows absolutely no overlap between the two. Ayala's Venn diagram of the universe is rectangle labeled "everything" with a square labeled "science" filling up the left half and another labeled "religion" occupying the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's absurd and dishonest because we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that religion makes claims about the natural world — it&amp;#39;s right there in the fabric of the institution of religion, which tells us how we material beings are supposed to act, where we came from, and where we&amp;#39;re going to go when we die. Ayala has to rewrite history to say that &lt;span&gt;"Religion has nothing definitive to say about these natural processes"&lt;/span&gt; when the religious themselves babble constantly about how every event from the trivial score fo a football game to the cosmic supernovae are evidence of the hand of their god. Somehow, religion is allowed to claim that we have a purpose in our life (life: it's a natural process, you know, something supposedly in the domain of science), but science may not, despite the fact that we've got a good look at our history and the mechanisms and the drives of life, and can say fairly strongly that there is no evidence of an external driver pushing us along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us admit that in one respect, he's right. Science isn't everything. We don't use science to appreciate a piece of art (although, fundamentally, it is a material object and our brains are similarly natural); we don't break out beakers and bunsen burners to determine if we've fallen in love; calculators have limited utility in writing poetry. That's fine, but it doesn't mean that religion fills in all the spaces! I don't consult a priest to find out what I think of a painting, prayer has bugger-all to do with love, and there is better poetry in the world than what we find in holy books. You don't get to simply assume that if science does something poorly, religion must do it well, and that the universe has to be neatly divvied up into these two mutually exclusive domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know that science does its job well, and even Airhead Ayala would agree with that. We can talk about and measure expertise in manipulating and examining the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about religion's "domain", values and purpose and its insight into a supernatural world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's all bullshit. There is no evidence, no reason to believe in a supernatural world at all; priests are no better than John Edward or James van Praagh at letting us see this hypothetical after-life, and are just as patently ridiculous. There is no agreement among all the religions, each claiming greater authority than all the others, on what our purpose is, other than the self-serving one of keeping the clergy prosperous. As for values: are homosexuals to be stoned, or treated as equals? Which is more important, the woman or her fetus? What foods are unclean and an abomination unto god? When the foreskin is lopped off, is that mandatory or a defilement of the temple of the human body? Are you allowed to mow your lawn on Sunday? Or on Saturday?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayala assumes and asserts and demands that we privilege religion as the final arbiter of those kinds of decisions. As far as I can see, though, there are no good reasons why believing in reincarnation or witches or angels or omnipotent phantasmal overlords makes one better qualified to decide what is right or good for people…to the contrary, it seems to me that such lunacy proudly declared shows that the believers are the &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; people to make real decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm embarrassed for Ayala, and my opinion of the guy is spiralling down fast. His entire essay is an exercise in making a false dichotomy and proposing a supernatural, superstitious authority that he doesn't even try to defend rationally. I guess this is what happens when the Templeton Foundation buys off your integrity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/oh_the_inanity_the_dalai_lama.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5eusp3eYI4k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275075462277"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=8744">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1eca123a7aaec2ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Hurricanes"/><category term="BP"/><category term="oil slick"/><title type="html">The Coming Hurricane Season is Forecast to Be Brutal</title><published>2010-05-28T19:37:27Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T19:37:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/05/28/the-coming-hurricane-season-is-forecast-to-be-brutal/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">I have to say, I am a bit staggered by just how severe the forecast from NOAA is for the Atlantic hurricane year 2010. We know these predictions aren't always spot on, but they get increasingly accurate as the season nears--and now just before June 1, NOAA is calling for 14-23 named storms, 8-14 hurricanes, and 3-7 major hurricanes.

In short, they're calling for a year that would almost rival the worst year on record--2005--the year of Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.

And of course, it hardly helps matters that we have tons of oil in the Gulf this year. If NOAA's forecast is really correct, it's hard for me to imagine that there won't be a number of storms that get into the Gulf and threaten to disrupt clean up operations and/or to drive oil all over the place.

This makes success in BP's ongoing "top kill" effort pretty crucial. If they can't get the spill stopped now, and it keeps pouring out oil well into the summer, then there will be hurricanes to contend with--and in a bad year, like 2005, the really strong ones can even come in July.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A teacher at a Catholic HS in Iowa was fired because she answered a poll about personal beliefs in a way her employer didn't like.  Apparently, Abby Nurre was surfing around Facebook last summer (before she started her job at the Catholic school) and decided to answer a poll question she found.  The poll asked whether she believed in God, angels or miracles - she answered "no".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now she's out of a job because, as the school board put it, she violated "a policy that prohibits employees from advocating principles contrary to the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a rather low threshold they&amp;#39;ve got — clicking on a poll is now &amp;quot;advocating&amp;quot;?

Next week, I promise to try to stay away from this issue as much as possible, not just to keep you from getting bored with it but, more importantly, to give myself the periodic rest from the concentrated idiocy to preserve my sanity. True, I can never guarantee that something won't come up that will force me to break my self-imposed vacation from the craziness, but I think that a few days away from this topic will do me good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I'd be very remiss if I didn't point out that at least one skeptic has already read Andrew Wakefield's new book, &lt;a href="http://www.callous-disregard.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines: The Truth Behind a Tragedy&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Harriet Hall, a.k.a &lt;a href="http://skepdoc.info"&gt;The SkepDoc&lt;/a&gt;, has not only read Wakefield's opus, but she's &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5343"&gt;panned it&lt;/a&gt;. One amusing tidbit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most unfortunate chapter in the book is "Poisoning Young Minds," a prime example of Godwin's law. He describes how a math question in schools in Nazi Germany used Jews as an example, thereby sowing the seeds of anti-Semitic propaganda into young, fertile Aryan minds. He compares this to a question on a UK biology exam that used Wakefield's study as an example, asking students whether it was reliable scientific evidence or might have been biased. This takes up a whole chapter!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! A &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/the_hitler_zombie_decimates_the_anti-vac.php"&gt;Hitler Zombie-worthy&lt;/a&gt; bit of nonsense from an &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/poisoning-young-minds.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism screed&lt;/a&gt; turned into an entire chapter in Wakefield's book. I'm sure glad Harriet read the book so that I don't have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_skepdoc_reviews_callous_disregard.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/fOCxbpxAZ-k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275073338896"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2c0ad2a202967d6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Project Alpha Lookback with Michael Edwards</title><published>2010-05-28T18:15:30Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T18:15:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1001-project-alpha-lookback-with-michael-edwards.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;

Original Alpha Kid, Michael Edwards pays a visit to the foundation  and recalls some of the behind the scenes tricks that he and Steve Shaw  (Banachek) did during the MacLab test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Project Alpha was an  elaborate hoax orchestrated by the stage magician and skeptic James  Randi. It involved planting two fake psychics, Steve Shaw (now better  known as Banachek) and Michael Edwards, into a paranormal  research  project. During the initial stages of the investigation, the researchers  came to believe that the pair's psychic powers were real. However, more  formal experiments, as well as criticism from both the parapsychology  community and Mr. Randi himself, led them to dismiss their initial  trust.[1]  The hoax was later revealed publicly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of  Project Alpha led Randi to use variations of the technique on several  other occasions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’ve been posting quite a few Saturn images from Cassini, but I really like this one. It shows the big round moon Rhea, the lumpy small moon Janus, and a lovely view of the foreshortened rings. Both moons were on the far side of the rings, well over 1 million kilometers away, when Cassini took this shot. Rhea is over 1500 km (900 miles) in diameter, while Janus is only about 180 km (110 miles) across. For comparison, our own Moon’s diameter is almost 3500 km (2100 miles).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just last year, the rings were edge-on to the Sun. In the months since, as Saturn slowly orbits our star, the Sun has begun shining down on the northern side of the rings. Cassini was just above the ring plane when it took this shot, catching the sunlight reflected off the rings. From this narrow angle, you can see the rings are divided into countless smaller ringlets, bright and dark sections carved into shape by the gravitational forces of the planet and its dozens of moons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how the top of Rhea is playing hide-and-seek in the rings. And look how dark the rocky Janus is compared to the icy Rhea! Even at a glance you can see that Saturn’s environment is an amazingly rich and diverse place. Cassini’s observations will keep planetary astronomers busy for decades… and provide the rest of us with a glimpse of the beauty and awe just waiting to be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.acsm.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Media&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;amp;CONTENTID=14704"&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, where you &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/live/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=live&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; is a significant factor determining your &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/health/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=health&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. ACSM’s &lt;a href="http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/index.htm"&gt;2010 American Fitness Index&lt;/a&gt; was just released – a ranking of the 50 biggest cities in the U.S. according to their levels of health care access, community support of public recreation areas, public policy determining fitness standards in schools, and the overall income of a city can actually have a big impact on the health of its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes for a healthy city? The American &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/fitness/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=fitness&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;Fitness&lt;/a&gt; Index ranking isn’t just about which cities have the most residents who hit the gym. The country’s healthiest cities generally have higher median incomes, a lower percentage of unemployed inhabitants, and fewer households below the  poverty line, but they also do specific things to get their populations  active. Advantages include a high number of primary health care  providers per capita and high numbers of parks, dog parks, tennis  courts, swimming pools, farmers markets. Most also have a high number of  inhabitants who walk, bike or use public transportation to get to work  or school. Living in these cities is likely to be a big health boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we just learned that those who brush their teeth fewer than twice a day have a &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/can-brushing-your-teeth-prevent-heart-disease/"&gt;70% greater risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll be stocking up on toothpaste from now on. So we may as well learn some new uses for it, which will save money, and help us avoid using chemical-filled cleaning products. Check out this handy list of alternative uses for toothpaste, thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.care2.com/greenliving/15-brilliant-uses-for-toothpaste-slideshow.html"&gt;Care2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Put a drop of toothpaste on a bug bite, sore, or blister to stop itching and decrease swelling. It will dry the blemish out, and make it heal faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If you burn yourself on a cookie sheet or anything else that results in  a minor (unopened) burn, apply toothpaste delicately to the burn after it develops. The toothpaste will cool the sting and stop the burn from opening or oozing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Before you start squeezing that pimple on your forehead, put a tiny bit of toothpaste on the blemish right before bed, then wash it off in the morning. It’ll dry it up in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Start brushing your fingernails, too. Since our teeth and nails are both made of enamel, it makes sense that toothpaste would clean, shine, and strengthen our nails. Just scrub the top and undersides of nails with a toothbrush and paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Out of hair gel and late for work? You can use gel toothpaste as a stand in. They’re both made out of the same water-soluble polymers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Cooking with garlic, fish, or onions sometimes results in seriously stinky hands. Scrub them with toothpaste to get rid of the odor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Spilling something dark on a favorite shirt or carpet can ruin your night. For clothing, apply toothpaste directly onto the stain and rub it quickly until the spot disappears, then wash it. With carpeting, put toothpaste on the stain and scrub it with a hard-bristled brush, then rinse. But don’t use whitening toothpaste – it could bleach the fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Your favorite pair of sneakers has seen better days. To brighten up the dirty rubber, squeeze some toothpaste onto the dirty area, scrub with a brush, then wipe clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Toothpaste is also a lifesaver when it comes to crayon on painted walls. Put toothpaste on a damp cloth, then gently rub away the crayon marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. When your favorite silver jewelry gets tarnished, simply rub with toothpaste and let it sit overnight. Wipe the pieces clean with a soft cloth in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. Scratches on DVDs and CDs can really be a bummer. If your disc is lightly scratched or smudged, try putting a thin coat of toothpaste on the disc. Rub it gently, then wipe it clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. The next time your piano keys are looking dingy, use a lint-free cloth and toothpaste on them. After rubbing the toothpaste in, wipe the keys clean with another lint-free cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. Baby bottles can develop a sour-milk smell after a while. Grab a bottle scrubber and some toothpaste to clean residue and deodorize – but make sure to rinse well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. If you’ve got a well-used iron, the plate may start to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/look/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=look&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; rusty and crusty. Rub toothpaste over it, and the silica in the paste will remove that layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. If your swim goggles start to get that foggy look, rub some toothpaste in them and rinse clean. No need for defogger here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/pregnancy/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=pregnancy&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and childbirth, women in the developed world are notorious for hopping in a car and zipping to the hospital at the first signs of labor, but in in the developing world, it’s not always an option. In Rwanda, where hospital access is scarce, a new Rapid SMS service was introduced in August of 2009 to help give people living in remote regions of the country quick access to healthcare. The system, a joint initiative between three United Nations organizations, is being tested in the Musanze District of Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell phones were given to 432 &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/health/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=health&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; workers in the Musanze District who then register pregnant women in their villages through SMS text messages. They can send updates on their conditions to a central server in the capital city of Kigali for monitoring. Those who are thought to be high-risk are brought in for check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a woman begins showing signs of labor, the local health worker is told and can send a text to the nearest hospital, which will send an ambulance. Women would typically avoid going to the hospital because of the long trip, which would sometimes end up causing serious complications. In Rwanda, 750 out of every 100,000 pregnant women die every year. The system is already showing signs of improving those odds: According to a hospital director in the Musanze District, they’ve had no deaths since the system launched.&lt;/p&gt;

For one thing, it’s a private library; like the &lt;a href="http://www.huntington.org/"&gt;Huntington Library&lt;/a&gt; in Pasadena, it’s supported almost entirely by private funds.  For another, Linda Hall is completely dedicated to science, technology, and engineering.  While visiting, I asked what they considered their peer institutions to be — the other science libraries they might be compared to.  Nobody could think of any.  It seems to be a completely unique place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://philosophyofscienceportal.blogspot.com/2008/09/linda-hall-library.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/05/lindahall.png" alt="lindahall" title="lindahall" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to tour deep into the bowels of the building, where stacks of journals and scientific reports seem to stretch for ages.  The library does a brisk job lending books and articles to other institutions; when you need a technical note from 1923 that tells you how a certain bridge was put together, this is the place to go.  There is also an amazing rare-book collection, some of which was being put on display as part of an &lt;a href="http://www.lindahall.org/events_exhib/index.shtml"&gt;exhibition&lt;/a&gt; entitled “Thinking Outside the Sphere: Views of the Stars from Aristotle to Herschel.”  I got to leaf through a first edition of Newton’s &lt;em&gt;Principia&lt;/em&gt;, which I have to say was pretty awesome.  I didn’t find any mistakes, but my Latin is a bit rusty.  Here are the three Laws of Motion, right near the beginning of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/05/principia.jpg" alt="principia" title="principia" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library also adds to the intellectual life of Kansas City by sponsoring public lectures.  I followed Sara Seager and Seth Shostak in &lt;a href="http://www.lindahall.org/events/exo_stream.shtml"&gt;a series about extraterrestrial life&lt;/a&gt;.  Not my area of expertise by any means, but they asked me to talk about time travel, which I do know something about.  (At least by the standards of other human beings, for which neither “time travel” nor “extraterrestrial life” are subjects of true expertise anywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D11917849%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D0%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3Dffffff%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=375" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/20/climate-change-followup/"&gt;Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli started investigating noted climate scientist Michael Mann&lt;/a&gt;. While at UVa, Mann was researching climate change. Cuccinelli has submitted a subpoena to get documents about Mann’s research, to see if he was abusing public funds. Cuccinelli’s motivations for doing this are suspect to say the least: Mann has already been cleared of any research wrongdoing. If Cuccinelli is trying to ride the &amp;quot;climategate&amp;quot; propaganda, he’s a day late and a docket short; that whole thing has already died with a fizzle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But the attacks continue, so the administration at UVa has filed a petition with a judge to set aside Cuccinelli’s subpoena, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Academic freedom is essential to the mission of our Nation’s institutions of higher learning and a core First Amendment concern,&amp;quot; UVa’s petition says. &amp;quot;As Thomas Jefferson intended, the University of Virginia has a long and proud tradition of embracing the ‘illimitable freedom of the human mind’ by fully endorsing and supporting faculty research and scholarly pursuits. Our Nation also has a long and proud tradition of limited government framed by enumerated powers which Jefferson ardently believed was necessary for a civil society to endure.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jefferson quote is particularly apt; Jefferson founded the University of Virginia, and even designed much of its architecture. A lot of the principles established by him are still apparent at UVa today. I attended the University for six years to get my doctorate, and so I know first-hand that the climate there is steeped in Jeffersonia, and his love of personal and academic freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuccinelli’s investigation appears to me to be an attempt to slow or smear research on climate change; an attack on the freedom of academic and scientific research, and cannot stand. I’m &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; glad to see UVa fighting back, and I hope this case becomes a national symbol of the recent attempts to silence science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s Comment o’ the Week is a winner not just for making me laugh, but for making me laugh at a topic that previously inspired in me only pure Hulk rage. That topic? The recent news that an acupuncturist testified that three men could not have committed the rape for which they were already convicted because a god damn acupuncturist said a small capillary in each one’s ear was unbroken, meaning that none had ever had sex with a woman before. My initial response to this news was WTFARRRRRRRRRRRDIEDIEDIE, but &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/skepchick-quickies-5-25/comment-page-1/#comment-103430"&gt;B Hitt managed to find the silver lining&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny bit of solace: that’s 3 more people that know for a fact that accupuncturists are full of shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is found in an astonishing array of everyday items – home siding, school supplies, car  interiors, medical tubing, and many more common products – but when PVC production produces dioxins, the most toxic  substances in the world and a known cause of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+CrikeyDaily+(Crikey+Daily)"&gt;Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt; singles out companies, like Nokia, that have stopped using PVC in the production of their goods, but it’s not only electronics producers that are moving away from the deadly plastic. Microsoft, Honda, Walmart, Target and Nike have all started shifting production away from PVC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Vinyl Institute, an industry trade group, thinks that the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/move/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=move&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; away from PVC is a mistake, and that no one will find a plastic better than PVC. With more and more consumers becoming aware of the hazards of PVC, we think most companies will settle for something not quite as sturdy but infinitely less toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell if a product was made from PVC if you &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/look/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=look&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; for the number 3 or the letter V inside the recycling triangle. (Check out Greenpeace’s &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/polyvinyl-chloride/pvc-products/"&gt;list of common products that contain PVC&lt;/a&gt;.) PVC products also tend to have a strong smell (like that vinyl shower curtain scent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that some companies have pledged to be PVC-free. Here’s a list of 21 popular companies that don’t use PVC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I contend that both – scientists denying religion and believers  rejecting science – are wrong. Science and religious beliefs need not be  in contradiction. If they are properly understood, they cannot be in  contradiction because science and religion concern different matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the definition of “properly understood religion” : religion that doesn’t contradict science.  This is all nice and neat, because it makes the assertion a tautology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to know is this: who is in charge of demarcating “properly understood” faith?  And what are we to do with those millions of misguided folks who obstinately refuse to make their faith &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait! There’s more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists deny that there can be valid knowledge about values  or about the meaning and purpose of the world and of human life. The  biologist Richard Dawkins explicitly denies design, purpose and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In River out of  Eden, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The universe that we observe has  precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no  design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless  indifference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Provine, a  historian of science, asserts that there are no absolute principles of  any sort. He believes modern science directly implies that there are no  inherent moral or ethical laws, no absolute guiding principles for human  society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a monumental contradiction in these assertions.  If its commitment to naturalism does not allow science to derive  values, meaning or purposes from scientific knowledge, it surely does  not allow it, either, to deny their existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins &lt;em&gt;denies&lt;/em&gt; purpose and values? I don’t think so.  I know both Dawkins and Provine, and while they believe that there are no moral or ethical laws &lt;em&gt;set out by God&lt;/em&gt;, they certainly believe in morals and ethics. And I’m equally sure they believe in “absolute guiding principles for human society.”  They just doesn’t think that those principles come from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest is straight NOMA (had Steve Gould lived, would he have won a Templeton Prize?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are people of faith who see the theory of evolution and  scientific cosmology as contrary to the creation narrative in Genesis.  But Genesis is a book of religious revelations and of religious  teachings, not a treatise on astronomy or biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Augustine, the great  theologian of the early Christian church, it is a blunder to mistake the  Bible for an elementary textbook of astronomy, geology, or other  natural sciences. As he writes in his commentary on Genesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If  it happens that the authority of sacred Scripture is set in opposition  to clear and certain reasoning, this must mean that the person who  interprets Scripture does not understand it correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who can say what the book of Genesis was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to mean?  I’ll give you ten to one that, when it was written, it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a treatise on astronomy and biology, at least as far as those things were understood by denizens of the Middle East two millennia ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, frankly, I’m tired of Augustine being trotted out in these kinds of discussions, as if his interpretation of the Bible was &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; the correct one.  I could trot out other theologians who would say the opposite.  And, if we’re going to hold up Augustine as the arbiter of Biblical interpretation, there’s that little matter of predestination. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful as it is, however, a scientific view of the world is  hopelessly incomplete. Matters of value and meaning are outside the  scope of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps (although Sam Harris would disagree).  But what is outside the scope of science is not automatically inside the scope of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accommodationists and Templetonians seem to believe if they endlessly repeat the discredited argument of non-overlapping magisteria, people will accept it.  Their guiding philosophy is &lt;a href="http://theotherpages.org/poems/carrol03.html"&gt;Snarkian&lt;/a&gt;: “What I tell you three times is true.”&lt;/p&gt;

Telling that to a mob of working scientists who have other pressing matters occupying them is dangerous, but I also told them of one easy way to spread the word about science: make your students do it, and coopt existing educational frameworks to make it happen. The specific suggestion I made was that graduate student journal clubs should be drafted to make writing a blog entry about that week's paper a part of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who haven&amp;#39;t been through the grad student grind may not be familiar with journal clubs, but they&amp;#39;re nearly universal. A general topic is chosen for a term — I&amp;#39;ve been involved with journal clubs as broad as &amp;quot;Neurobiology&amp;quot; and as specific as &amp;quot;Astrobiology and mechanisms of bacterial survival in space&amp;quot;. The group usually meets once a week, and each week one member presents a discussion of a single paper in the field. It&amp;#39;s fun, it hones critical thinking, and forces students to trace ideas through the primary research literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can see how easily that would adapt to science blogging. Just have your student presenter be responsible for writing up a basic summary of the paper to be posted to the web ahead of time — they&amp;#39;re already doing all the work, they&amp;#39;ve made notes on the paper, it&amp;#39;s an easy step to take…and it adds an outreach and communication component to an existing educational responsibility. It&amp;#39;s win-win all around. If you&amp;#39;re faculty running a journal club at your university, think about doing it next term — it adds to the flowering of accessible summaries of key research papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want an example? Here's one from the evo-devo group at the University of Oregon, on &lt;a href="http://evodevogeno.wordpress.com/"&gt;Evolution, Development, and Genomics&lt;/a&gt;. It contains everything you need, references, links to sources, and good summaries of research — and it all spins out organically from something grad students everywhere do all the time. The only thing it&amp;#39;s really missing now is active comments from outsiders, and that&amp;#39;s one concern … when we&amp;#39;re all doing this, it&amp;#39;s going to be hard to get the readership for any one journal club blog to get good feedback. The important thing, though, is that the information is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I can do to help is link to some of these sorts of blogs. If any of you are going to be trying this next fall, send me a link to your public journal club page, and I&amp;#39;ll put together a listing and post it at the start of the school year (don&amp;#39;t send it to me now, it&amp;#39;ll get lost — contact me in August). Also, and even more importantly, get your blog registered with &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/"&gt;Research Blogging&lt;/a&gt;, which is an excellent central aggregator of exactly the kinds of articles a journal club blog will be churning out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/blogging_journal_clubs_as_a_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Tft_WdlZdvA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275065150292"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/its_not_just_the_catholics.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c02cf7d6bb8d62b4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">It's not just the Catholics!</title><published>2010-05-28T15:01:32Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T15:01:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/6fH9z3LE-r0/its_not_just_the_catholics.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/its_not_just_the_catholics.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bill Donohue will be so relieved. Here's a story about a &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100528/ap_on_re_us/us_church_rape_case"&gt;youn girl being raped, her assailant protected by the church, and the girl herself getting all the blame&lt;/a&gt;…and it&amp;#39;s the Baptists! Tina Anderson was raped by Ernest Willis, a Trinity Baptist Church member, when she was 15, and got pregnant. She accused Willis in the church, and here&amp;#39;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pastor heard Anderson's allegations, he told her that if she had "lived in the Old Testament," she would have been stoned to death for not reporting the attack sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"He also said I had 'allowed myself to be put in a compromising situation,' Anderson said. The pastor decided she needed to be "church-disciplined."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"I was completely humiliated," Anderson said, her voice quavering at the memory. "I hoped it was a nightmare I'd wake up from, and it wouldn't be true anymore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Church discipline" apparently means sending the victim out of state and asking all church members silent, not bringing the matter to secular authorities. They stayed quiet for 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tina Anderson went on with her life, got married, had kids, and took a job as a music teacher at a Baptist college. When she was contacted by investigators tracking down the case, though, she did something remarkable: she woke up to how she'd been abused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was kind of in shock, but I just answered his questions," Anderson said. "Everything is changing because I'm seeing the things I was taught for so many years are not necessarily correct. It's almost like I had blinders on, believing all of this was my fault." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is beautiful; this is what it is like to free yourself of religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they're not dealt with, the cycle will continue," said Anderson, who resigned from the Baptist college the day before Willis was arrested. "&lt;b&gt;I do not, anymore, unquestioningly obey authority, which is what they would teach.&lt;/b&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/its_not_just_the_catholics.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6fH9z3LE-r0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275064460029"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/05/friday_sprog_blogging_evidence.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef3193336f573196</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kids and science"/><title type="html">Friday Sprog Blogging: evidence of science.</title><published>2010-05-28T17:32:28Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T17:32:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/4l-Z_4Que94/friday_sprog_blogging_evidence.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2010/05/friday_sprog_blogging_evidence.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jet-lag and grading fatigue (plus being on the other coast for three days) mean that I haven't had much time lately to sit down with the sprogs and have a conversation about science.

From Frobisch and Reisz (2009)

 When I hear the phrase "early human relative" I cannot help but think of an ape-like creature. Something like Sahelanthropus fits the bill nicely - it may not be a hominin but it is still a close relative from around the time that the first hominins evolved. That is why I was a bit puzzled to see MSNBC.com parroting a story written by the Discovery Channel which proclaimed "Early human relative predates even dinosaurs"! Was this another fossil that would change everything? While not quite as startling as a Precambrian rabbit, a 260-million-year-old-hominin (or even primate) would certainly be a shocker!

The truth of the matter, however, is that the fossil described in the MSNBC story is only a distant relative of humans. Called Suminia getmanovi, it was a synapsid (the diverse group of vertebrates to which mammals and their closest relatives belong) that lived during the Permian in what is now Russia. More specifically, it was an anomodont, or a relative of the tubby Lystrosaurus and the small, tusked Robertia. The attempt to make Suminia relevant to human ancestry, therefore, was a quick and dirty way of grabbing attention, but in this case I think it stirred more confusion than enlightenment.

Well, it might well be hemopressin. At least, that&amp;#39;s probably your anti-marijuana.Hemopressin is a small protein that was discovered in the brains of rodents in 2003: its name comes from the fact that it&amp;#39;s a breakdown product of hemoglobin and that it can lower blood pressure.No-one seems to have looked to see whether hemopressin is found in humans, yet, but it seems very likely. Almost everything that&amp;#39;s in your brain is in a mouse&amp;#39;s brain, and vice versa.Pharmacologically, hemopressin&amp;#39;s literally an anti-marijuana molecule: it&amp;#39;s an inverse agonist at CB1 receptors, which are the ones targeted by the psychoactive compounds in marijuana, and also by the neurotransmitters known as endocannabinoids. Cannabinoids turn CB1 receptors on, hemopressin turns them off.Artificial CB1 blockers were developed as weight loss drugs, and one of them, rimonabant, made it onto the market - but it was banned after it turned out that it caused depression and anxiety in many people.So hemopressin is Nature&amp;#39;s rimonabant: in which case, it ought to do what rimonabant does, which is to reduce appetite. And indeed a Journal of Neuroscience paper just out from Godd et al shows that it does just that, in rats and mice: injections of hemopressin reduced feeding.Interestingly, this worked even when it was injected by the standard route under the skin - many proteins can&amp;#39;t enter the brain if they&amp;#39;re given this way, because they can&amp;#39;t cross the blood-brain barrier, meaning that they have to be injected directly into the brain, which makes researching them much harder. So hemopressin, with any luck, will be pretty easy to study. Any volunteers for the first human trial...?Dodd, G., Mancini, G., Lutz, B., &amp;amp; Luckman, S. (2010).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out our roundup of three allegedly &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/naturally-clean-hand-sanitizer-breakdown/"&gt;all-natural hand sanitizer gels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, instant hand sanitizer gels have made it a little easier to stay clean on-the-go. They’re great for hospital waiting rooms and other places where germs run rampant, or after your ride on public transportation. But hand sanitizer gels won’t work unless you use them properly. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Buy hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol – anything less won’t kill viruses and bacteria as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Squirt a lot onto your hand – doctors recommend a blob the size of a silver dollar. There needs to be enough gel to wet the entire back and front of your hands, since a sanitizer only kills germs with which it has direct contact. Rub the gel into your hands for at least 30 seconds, and don’t touch anything until your skin is completely dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Here’s the rub – don’t use sanitizers all the time. They’re handy when the nearest public rest rooms are less than tidy, but warm water and soap really do a better job of eliminating germs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Use a good moisturizer, because instant sanitizer gels really dry out the  skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you use hand sanitizers, or do you think exposure to germs builds up your immune system? Take our poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Deaton&lt;/strong&gt; and other members of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=262523455102"&gt;Atheists/Agnostics/Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; attended a city council meeting to voice their opposition to the invocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/9nx2m39QFXI%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally able to get a transcript of Joshua’s speech — it’s a great example for anyone else who may be in a similar position — and I wanted to share it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Our Mayor has decided that our City Council meetings shall now begin with prayer.  According to the News &amp;amp; Record, Mayor Knight has stated that prayer is a “distinctly American quality and a very necessary element.”  According to the same article, the Mayor is aware of the need to be inclusive, to not leave anyone out, so he will invite individuals from different faiths to participate in the invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find two serious problems with the mayor’s position: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The mayor may be working to include persons of all faiths (which is laudable), but non-sectarian prayer still excludes the non-religious (such as myself).  The City Council’s previous practice of a moment of silence allowed for persons of all faiths to pray, while refusing to use our city government as a tool to advocate the value of prayer.  Was a moment of silence really inhibiting anyone from a private moment of prayer?  Of course not.  The mayor’s decision is nothing more than a government endorsement of prayer, and an insult to the non-religious residents of this great city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The mayor justified his decision by claiming that prayer is a distinctly American quality, which implies that there is something un-American (or less patriotic) about those of us who do not pray.  What if the mayor had justified any other revision of our City Council meetings by insinuating that Catholics or Jews or Muslims were somehow not quite as American as his fellow Methodists?  Of course this would not be acceptable.  And the mayor’s statement is no more acceptable simply because those who are excluded and whose citizenship is devalued are atheists.  Respect for religious liberties is an American quality, and Mayor Knight is certainly entitled to believe whatever he wants about atheists like me.  But it is completely unacceptable that he should use the people of Greensboro’s City Council as a platform to advocate his private belief in the necessity of prayer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Phillip&lt;/strong&gt; for putting this together!)&lt;br&gt;

I reject all religious faiths and paranormal claims. In fact I reject faith, period. I should never take a leap of faith beyond what the evidence leads me to conclude. So I do not believe. I am a non-believer. That distinguishes me from people who believe. Believers are all in one &lt;a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595464/category.html"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; (or type, or classification) of knowers. Non-believers are in a different category of knowers. Believers base what they claim to know on faith. Non-believers base what they claim to know on the actual probabilities. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Non-believers are therefore skeptics. We do not accept any assertion without confirming evidence to support it and therefore we do not accept any paranormal claim. We doubt all extraordinary claims of faith. We reject faith based reasoning in all of its forms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is the dividing line between those who are believers and those who are non-believers. All believers are in one camp of people. All non-believers are in a different camp. This distinction best describes us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it will do no good for believers in their dominant cultural religions to argue against atheism. In Hindu countries Hindu's argue against atheism, just as Muslims do in Islamic countries, or Orthodox Jews do in Israel, or as Christians do in America. In each of these cultures they assume that if they can argue against atheism then by default their religious faith wins. Here in America there have been many debates where the question is between Christianity or atheism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is a real significant problem here for believers. There are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity"&gt;many types of Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, including the so-called &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/reference/semhtml?title=Christian_new_religious_movement&amp;amp;src=mtoc&amp;amp;fwd=1&amp;amp;qpvt=Christian+cults&amp;amp;q=christian+cults"&gt;Christian cults&lt;/a&gt;. Several other types of Christianity have even died out. So before we can even have a debate between Christianity and atheism there must first be debates between Christians on which Christianity represents true Christianity. And this goes for the many other &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/reference/semhtml?title=Major_religious_groups&amp;amp;src=mtoc&amp;amp;fwd=1&amp;amp;qpvt=world+religions&amp;amp;q=world+religions"&gt;world religions&lt;/a&gt;. Before there can be a debate between any given culturally dominant religion and atheism there must first be debates to settle which religion is the correct one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? Because skepticism, or atheism, or non-belief, are in an entirely different category than religious faith. On the one hand there is skepticism. By applying skepticism across the board, atheism is the position of last resort. It's adopted through the process of elimination as one religion after another is rejected for the same reasons they are all rejected. It is a consistent approach to all religions. On the other hand there is faith. Religions embrace faith based reasoning which goes beyond what the evidence calls for. The problem for religious faith then is why believers should adopt one faith over the others once they admit it's legitimate to embrace faith based reasoning in the first place!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's faith that we skeptics reject. It's faith that believers embrace. We stand consistently in one camp. Believers are all in a different camp. The choice is emphatically NOT between any given culturally adopted religion and atheism. The choice is between all religions on one side of the fence and atheism on the other side. First believers must settle the question of which religion is the correct one because they all embrace faith based reasoning. But precisely because they embrace faith these religious disputes cannot be settled between them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheists are simply &lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/waiting+in+the+wings.html"&gt;waiting in the wings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;;-)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7723334089062754974?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The annual convention, held this past weekend in Manchester, New Hampshire, is in its 7th year and one of the best attended in the region. This was the first time that a panel focusing on skepticism has been part of the lineup. The panel featured four members of the Granite State Skeptics (Travis Roy, Dale Roy, Jan Stephan Lundquist, and Kitty Mervine) and myself, representing the James Randi Educational Foundation. Topics discussed included general skepticism, ghosts, critical thinking in education, cryptozoology, and creationism. The subject of alien abduction claims received the most attention. Panelist Kitty Mervine had some interesting insights on the history of and possible explanations for such claims. She also offered advice on responsible and effective communication with those who believe they have been victims of abduction. Mervine is the creator of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="bad alien" href="http://www.badalien.org/"&gt;Bad Alien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; website. The panel will return in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon*Con’s enormous national event has taught us that the skeptical and sci-fi/comic communities have a natural affinity.  I can’t think of a reason why skepticism-related programing couldn’t also succeed at smaller regional conventions like this, which are held in every major city in the United States.  It would be great to see local organizations following the lead of the New Hampshire event and helping to bring panels like this to comic cons in their part of the country, taking advantage of a valuable outreach opportunity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting Manchester, I enjoyed an evening at the monthly Skeptics in the Pub and was generously invited to present a talk on the false dichotomy of zoology and cryptozoology. Skeptics in the Pub is just one of the events offered by the very active Granite State Skeptics, who also do field trips and investigations. &lt;a title="tam workshop" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/883-the-amazing-meeting-8-2010-workshops.html"&gt;The workshop on grassroots skeptical organizing&lt;/a&gt; to be part of TAM8 will feature GSS president, Travis Roy, as a presenter.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>mblanford@randi.org (Michael Blanford)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275057978064"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/todays_carnivals_497.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/962c2801bd0363e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2010-05-28T15:42:30Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T15:42:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/_tK-5q60_bc/todays_carnivals_497.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/todays_carnivals_497.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I and the Bird&lt;/strong&gt; #126 is up on &lt;a href="http://coyotemercury.com/blog1/2010/05/27/i-and-the-bird-126/" title=""&gt;Coyote Mercury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Lame. Just call him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Dating is confusing, so we make up rules to follow. Amid the chaos of trying to interpret texts, voicemails, and morning-after behavior, there are feelings to be hurt, so we like to give ourselves some safety rails. Problem is, even though dating rules are meant to help us succeed, we don’t always think they’re true, or that they apply to everyone. Whether you’re a Sandy Olsson-type or a true Betty Rizzo, we think it’s time to grow up and break these dating-rule dinosaurs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Men Should Always Pay.&lt;/strong&gt; We call bullshit. If someone – anyone – invites us to a specific restaurant or event, sure, we’d like them to pay. Same goes if we do the inviting. There’s nothing wrong with someone paying for your meal, but we believe a healthy relationship can spring out of splitting the bill, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Just kiss on a first date.&lt;/strong&gt; This rule is built on all kinds of assumptions that men are always the  ones trying to “get lucky” on a date, and if &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; taught us  anything, it’s that this is a big fat lie. If you’re dating to get laid, then go right ahead – and carry condoms. If you’re dating to get to know someone and build a meaningful relationship beyond sex, own that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Always make him ask you out first.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re not big fans of being passive, so this isn’t our favorite dating tenet. We believe in taking initiative, and this applies to dating, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Never be available when he wants you to be.&lt;/strong&gt; If you actually have a life (which we know you do), you don’t need to sit around pretending you’re busy: You are! Don’t drop all plans for a guy – if you have a date with the treadmill, keep it – but don’t play games, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Always laugh at his jokes.&lt;/strong&gt; A stony glare never helped a date go smoothly, but we don’t think you should fake a laugh any more than you should fake an orgasm. Funny guys win big points (and laughs), but we shouldn’t have to win &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; points by acting more entertained than we actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have dating rules you &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/live/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=live&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt; by? Tell us whether you believe in dating rules in the comments section, below:&lt;/p&gt;

As one of the eight targets of the Millennium Development Goals, child mortality is among the better indicators we have for the health status of a given population, and is, in the words of Michael Marmot, &amp;quot;the health outcome most sensitive to the effects of absolute material deprivation.&amp;quot;[Children in Burma; The Irrawaddy]So where are we? The authors report that 7.7 million children will die in 2010, compared to 11.9 million in 1990. The reaction to this, of course, can be nothing but mixed - things are getting better, and at a faster rate than we previously supposed, but the number of deaths each year is still numbingly high. Note that the previous UN estimate (here, as of 5/27/10) was that, in 2008, 8.77 million children died, while the current study estimates the number at 7.95 million. It&amp;#39;s hard to think of 800,000 children as a calculating error, but so it is.These new numbers are a 35% reduction since 1990, which is the reference year for the MDGs. The MDG for child mortality aims for a two-thirds reduction by 2015. So we&amp;#39;ve come about half of the way in 80% of the time... not stunning progress, but as the fall in mortality seems to be accelerating, the goal (which would comprise, according to the new study, 3.9 million child deaths in 2015) is not beyond reach.I want to comment here on the methodology used to estimate the number of deaths, as nearly every headline on the topic has highlighted the fact that these estimates are substantially lower than previous estimates (in the MSM&amp;#39;s defense, the authors highlight the same issue in the discussion, as they should).It takes only a moment&amp;#39;s consideration to realize the mind-boggling difficulty of getting an accurate count of the millions of children who die in a year. Anyone familiar with global health will know that there is a wide range of quality in the estimates put out by nations and international organizations. As a start towards classifying the quality of data, the authors grouped data sources into 10 types:Demographic and Health Surveys, World Fertility Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, Pan Arab Project for Family Health Surveys, CDC Reproductive Health Surveys, census birth histories, complete vital regristration systems, incomplete vital and sample registration systems in low- and middle-income countries, complete vital and sample registration systems in low- and middle-income countries, and a category for all other sources.The basic approach is this. You assume that the function describing mortality in a country between 1990 and 2010 has a certain shape, but that we don&amp;#39;t know what that shape is. Instead of assuming a particular function, such as linear or logistic, that describes the relationship, one can define a &amp;quot;function of functions&amp;quot; that describes the probability of a given function giving rise to the observed data (here, the various estimates of child mortality in a given country). This probability is also known as the likelihood (as in, the likelihood that this function would give rise to this data).The authors of the current paper used a technique called Gaussian Process Regression (GPR, or Kriging) to estimate the best function that would describe the child mortality curve for each country. Because GPR is an interpolation technique, it &amp;quot;fills in&amp;quot; the points between actual data points, which in this case are the individual estimates of child mortality. The term &amp;#39;Gaussian Process&amp;#39; refers to what is more commonly known as a random walk. By assuming that the shape of the curve is a random walk between the observed points, the curve is allowed to obtain nearly any shape. The &amp;#39;Regression&amp;#39; part comes in when the error is minimized - namely, the best Gaussian Process is the one described by the curve which would require the fewest random steps to fit the observed data points. The figure below shows a typical GPR; the green lines define the uncertainty, which increases as you get farther from an observed data point.[A Gaussian Process Regression; Wikipedia]This is all a gross simplification. The point is that GPR is a flexible interpolation technique that can be used when you don&amp;#39;t know the &amp;quot;shape&amp;quot; your data should take, and you want to account for unknown deviations from a particular form (the authors give as a known example the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, which caused an increase in child mortality).But back to child mortality. The authors employed this GPR technique to obtain country-by-country estimates, and then summed to derive their final predictions. This allows us to compare nations and regions on their child mortality statistics.Unfortunately, two regions may have had no reduction in child mortality between 1990 and 2010 - souther Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. Quite stunningly, the authors estimate that child mortality in Swaziland increased from 25.8 million to 38.3 million between 1990 and 2010.But the overall picture of global child mortality is, in the end, a bit brighter this week. We might meet MDG 4 after all. Global health infrastructure and social systems may be stronger than we previously supposed. Most importantly, fewer children are dying today than at any date in recent history.Reference:Rajaratnam, J., Marcus, J., Flaxman, A., Wang, H., Levin-Rector, A., Dwyer, L., Costa, M., Lopez, A., &amp;amp; Murray, C.

His points are well-taken, and have given me pause. None of the claims Ralf has made for this imagery are physically impossible -- I checked the math, and I have a pretty good knowledge of image reduction and analysis -- but that does not mean they are correct. I want to be careful and say I am skeptical of these claims, but cannot say whether they are correct or not. In the future I'll be more careful in my own wording in my posts.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralf Vandebergh, an astronomer in The Netherlands, has sent me many of his outstanding images of space vehicles in the past. But he just sent one to me that I have to admit, rather shocked me: &lt;a href="http://www.startje.be//vieuw.php?qid=354758"&gt;an image of a Keyhole 11 spy satellite&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.startje.be//vieuw.php?qid=354758"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/vandebergh_kh111.jpg" alt="vandebergh_kh11" title="vandebergh_kh11" width="610" height="458"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/334rfem"&gt;At the time Ralf took these images&lt;/a&gt;, the satellite was about 600 km (360 miles) away, a considerable distance for a small object. Mind you, this satellite is about 5 meters (16 feet) long, so the fact that any detail is seen at all is amazing. It would appear to be less than 2 arcseconds in length at best — that’s the same apparent size as a U.S. quarter seen at a distance of about 3 km (nearly two miles!). For comparison, the Moon is 1800 arcseconds across, or 900 times bigger, so we’re talking weensy weensy here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.spacetoday.org/Satellites/YugoWarSats.html"&gt;Keyhole satellites are pretty well-known&lt;/a&gt; in space circles, and the KH-11s have been around a while (the next-generation &lt;a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/kh-12.htm"&gt;KH-12s&lt;/a&gt; have been around a while too, but not much is known about them). The 11s are pretty much like Hubble Space Telescope, but pointed down at us — well, presumably not &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, but as opposed to pointed out toward the heavens. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Given some basic physics, and assuming the same optics as Hubble has, it’s easy to calculate that they should be able to spot objects as small as perhaps 10 cm (4 inches) across, though this would require either some very precise tracking or very short exposures to prevent blurring. Or maybe both. It’s also possible to improve on that resolution a bit using sophisticated mathematical techniques, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While little or no orbital data is known for the KH-12s, the orbits of KH-11s (at least, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of them, dun dun &lt;em&gt;dunnnn&lt;/em&gt;) are online. Ralf used that data to predict where and when to get these images. In the picture above he compares what he got to a simplified Hubble-like drawing, and with some small amount of imagination you can see the resemblance. I wouldn’t put too much stock in the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; configuration, but it does appear he got some detail on the satellite. He also has &lt;a href="http://img44.imageshack.us/img44/6/usa16110052302060626j.gif"&gt;a neat animation&lt;/a&gt; showing the satellite; details are harder to see but he catches some hint of solar panels, as well as catching a flash of sunlight off a reflective surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note he’s done all this with a 25 cm (10″) telescope. With something bigger, higher resolution is possible. Not so much because the image can be magnified more, but because shorter exposures are possible (bigger ’scopes capture more light from an object), freezing the atmospheric distortion better. I have seen some pretty big ’scopes that are used to track satellites, which makes me wonder how much detail they capture… and who &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; is out there tracking our satellites as well.&lt;/p&gt;

They want you to write a letter to your representatives supporting the repeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another reason besides simple common decency to end a discriminatory practice: It will drive Bryan Fischer insane(r). Fischer is the unpleasant Idaho bigot who thinks &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/02/arent_they_cute_when_they_unas.php"&gt;homosexuals should be imprisoned&lt;/a&gt;, and he's got his &lt;a href="http://action.afa.net/Blogs/BlogPost.aspx?id=2147494882"&gt;own peculiar take on gays in the military&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homosexuality gave us Adolph Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews. Gays in the military is an experiment that has been tried and found disastrously and tragically wanting. Maybe it's time for Congress to learn a lesson from history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Bryan Fischer, it's a simple and direct causal relationship: gay people want to join the military so they can reinstate Adolf Hitler's policies and exterminate the Jews and Christians, and the Nazis were all gay all the time. But wait, you say, didn't the Nazis round up homosexuals and put them in death camps? Your paltry imagination cannot grasp the subtle twists that the minds of frantic homophobes can invent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Lively's well-documented book, "The Pink Swastika," exposes a secret homosexual activists don't want you to know about Nazi Germany: that although the Nazis did persecute homosexuals, the homosexuals the Nazis persecuted were almost exclusively the effeminate members of the gay community in Germany, and that much of the mistreatment was administered by masculine homosexuals who despised effeminacy in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See? They only killed all the &lt;i&gt;swishy&lt;/i&gt; ones, but the butch ones all joined the SS. The logic is irrefutable. Extravagantly masculine macho men who want to beat up and imprison and subjugate other men must be gay themselves…oh. Hey. Isn&amp;#39;t Fischer promoting… nah, that couldn&amp;#39;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His source, Scott Lively, isn't exactly reputable, either. Watch &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/150328/vanguard-missionaries-of-hate"&gt;Missionaries of Hate&lt;/a&gt; (sorry, non-Americans, that's on Hulu). Lively is the American missionary who inspired the Ugandan hate laws; you'll also learn about the odious liar, Ssempa, who is using Christianity to foment an insane level of prejudice in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not at all worried about a diverse community of gays suddenly charging off into flaming fascism. I'm more concerned about existing fascists in the evangelical community acquiring more influence. They are far more predisposed to encourage oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

Vanessa is a Research Scientist in Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and studies the cognition of chimpanzees and bonobos in Congo.

 We like to think that murderers are psychopaths, with some kind of abnormal psychology that would never appear in us, or someone we know. And yet most of us think we would kill in certain situations, like if we were at war, or someone was about to kill a person we loved.

How 'natural' is this instinct in us, and can we ever obliterate it completely?

In my new book, Bonobo Handshake, I talk about lethal aggression in one of our closest relatives, chimpanzees.

Chimpanzees and humans have a lot in common when it comes to killing:

#1 Killers are mostly male. Though female chimpanzees can participate in killing, usually the killers are males. In humans too, the FBI reported in 2005 that 89% of killers are male  .

#2 Males usually attack when the ratio is 3:1. Wrangham and Wilson reported that both chimpanzees and young men in gangs attack when they outnumber their victim 3 to 1 or more. The reason for this? This is the minimum number ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F05%2F28%2Fare-we-hardwired-to-kill%2F" width="100%" height="60" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275053619175"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=5544">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/58fc33efa881dc93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Death better than autism says Andrew Wakefield</title><published>2010-05-28T07:04:26Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T07:04:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/death-better-than-autism-says-andrew-wakefield/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Kev</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275053565878"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=180016">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1368345e94d1e452</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="funny quotes"/><category term="humor"/><category term="quote of the day"/><category term="quotes"/><title type="html">Marilyn Monroe on Nudity Rumors:</title><published>2010-05-28T12:00:31Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T12:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/marilyn-monroe-on-rumors/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It’s not true that I had nothing on.

Promoters claim that sharks do not get cancer, because of anti-cancer properties of their cartilage. However – &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/nws/content/nws_1_1x_sharks_get_cancer.asp"&gt;sharks do get cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents further claim that shark cartilage (and other cartilage products, like bovine cartilage) increase immune activity, kill cancer cells, and prevent angiogenesis – the formation of new blood vessels to feed tumors. None of these properties have been demonstrated, however.The anti-angiogenesis theory is at least plausible – but the simple fact is, if this potential were there a pharmaceutical company would have isolated, purified, and produced a drug based upon the cartilage long ago – with proven efficacy. There has been some interesting basic science, but nothing that has led to an effective drug. And what is on the market is mostly “crude extracts” – nothing but snake oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of use, and millions of dollars spent by cancer patients on dubious cartilage products, the evidence has been &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574750"&gt;solidly negative&lt;/a&gt;. So negative, in fact, that we can confidently conclude that shark cartilage is probably not an effective treatment for any type of cancer. There is certainly no justification for its use, which has led to several very negative outcomes: a decline in shark populations, worse outcomes for cancer patients who delayed or ignored proven treatments due to the false promises of shark cartilage, and a vast waste of resources, mostly diverted to people of dubious credibility and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we lived in a more rational world, that would be the end of it – but we don’t. So we need to waste money doing further research, going way beyond due diligence, just to serve the irrational beliefs of a subset of the public. That is, in fact, largely what the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine does, which is why they funded (along with the National Cancer Institute) a study of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20505152"&gt;shark cartilage in non-small cell lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was a double-blind placebo controlled trial with 379 subjects of standard therapy + placebo vs standard therapy + AE-941 (a brand of shark cartilage).  You can read the details in the linked abstract – suffice it to say the results were dead negative. There was no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure – this is just one study of one type of cancer. Cancer is a category of disease, not one disease. I am not saying this should be sufficient to abandon any particular treatment. However, this is just the latest in a long line of negative studies of shark cartilage. When is enough enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if there are researchers who want to explore this further, that is fine. But there is certainly no justification for a market for shark cartilage for cancer. If anything meets the definition of snake oil, this does. I think we can also conclude that any country that claims to have effective regulation of health products that protects their citizens from worthless or harmful products or false claims, should not allow the sale of shark cartilage for cancer. In other words – we do not have effective regulation of health products. Some people believe that we do not need such regulation, which is a political/ideological opinion they are welcome to. But I think we can objectively say – we don’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to have this new evidence to combat the true-believers and snake-oil promoters. But scientific evidence needs to be coupled, in my opinion, with effective regulation, otherwise we are just talking to ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275049844604"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=12633">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/160246994982d336</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">The new Templeton Prize winner speaks</title><published>2010-05-28T12:30:36Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T12:30:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-new-templeton-prize-winner-speaks/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/3073/full"&gt;Read&lt;/a&gt; and see how you too can get a million pounds.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, one can believe in both evolution and God. Evolution is a  well-confirmed scientific theory. Christians and other people of faith  need not see evolution as a threat to their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like saying “Gazelles and other antelopes need not see lions as a threat to their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

Sarah Jessica Parker arrived in a black strapless dress from the house of her favorite British designer, and what she told her fans provided another interesting example of what Mark Liberman noted in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2176"&gt;recent post on fashion talk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There's only one person I could have worn tonight and that was Alexander McQueen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Parker didn't just say she was wearing Alexander McQueen; she actually used an expression quantifying over persons (&lt;i&gt;only one person&lt;/i&gt;) as the understood object of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;wear&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (in the sense that she modified &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt; with the relative clause &lt;i&gt;I could have worn ___&lt;/i&gt;), and then clarified that the person was Alexander McQueen; and still the metonymic reading survived and was understood by fans and journalists alike.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This usage is a close relative of the construction &lt;i&gt;Who are you wearing?&lt;/i&gt; that &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2176"&gt;Mark drew attention to&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a slight though not unprecedented extension of normal metonymy. It needs a special term; call it &lt;b&gt;creative work metonymy&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say it is not unprecedented because of examples like &lt;i&gt;Who are you reading?&lt;/i&gt; (the phrase gets about 695,000 Google hits).  When you say that you are reading Dan Brown, you are likely to mean not that you can look into his eyes and see what he's thinking but merely that you are engrossed in &lt;i&gt;The Lost Symbol&lt;/i&gt;.  But you can also ask someone who they are reading, or say that Dan Brown is the only person you read now.  In creative work metonymy, a reference to a person is robustly construed as conveying a reference to their creative work product.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is a bit of an extension of ordinary metonymy, which is not so robust.  Although we might say &lt;i&gt;Pyongyang must be responsible&lt;/i&gt; after discovering that the Republic of Korea Navy's ship the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROKS_Cheonan_%28PCC-772%29"&gt;Cheonan&lt;/a&gt; had been torpedoed in South Korean waters, we wouldn't say &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;The only city that could have done this is Pyongyang&lt;/i&gt;. That would wreck the metonymy.  It would sound (to me, anyway) too literal, and I'd want to protest, "It wasn't the city, it was the regime."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, although we might say &lt;i&gt;Hollywood thinks people are stupid&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that the film industry people make movies that treat us as morons, it would ruin the metonymy to say something like &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;One area of Los Angeles that thinks people are stupid is Hollywood&lt;/i&gt;.  Again, that sounds literal: we&amp;#39;d react by thinking, &amp;quot;Hey, an area of Los Angeles can&amp;#39;t have an opinion…&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a modest degree, then, I think creative work metonymy is slightly different from the more familiar kinds, which is perhaps what drew Mark's attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Michele Bachmann&lt;/strong&gt; (R-MN) do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secular Coalition for America &lt;a href="http://www.secular.org/bachmann_prayer"&gt;explains it like this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Bachmann] introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization bill that &lt;strong&gt;would allow chaplains in the military to use specifically-Christian prayers at official military events&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href="http://www.rules.house.gov/amendment_details.aspx?NewsID=4665"&gt;exact wording of Bachmann’s amendment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
#56 Would ensure that any chaplain serving in the US Armed Forces, if called upon to lead a prayer outside of a religious service, would be free to close that prayer according to the dictates of the chaplain’s conscience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that chaplains are &lt;a href="http://www.maaf.info/demographics.html"&gt;disproportionately Christian&lt;/a&gt;, this is a thinly-veiled attempt at getting Christian prayers said at things like graduations and promotion ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCA is obviously opposing this amendment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Given chaplains’ mandate to serve a religiously pluralistic population, &lt;strong&gt;it is unacceptable for them to advance any one religious viewpoint over any other, including monotheism over other types of theism or nontheism&lt;/strong&gt;. To change the current policy and permit references to Jesus, for example, is an insult to minority religions and nontheists of all stripes who serve our nation in the United States Armed Forces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, though, &lt;a href="http://blog.au.org/2010/05/27/outmaneuvering-bachmann-minn-rep%E2%80%99s-military-strike-thwarted-by-au-reconnaissance/"&gt;the amendment died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
AU Legislative Director Aaron Schuham learned of the scheme on Wednesday while scanning the defense bill’s hundreds of amendments to check for potential church-state problems. He and AU’s legislative team quickly swung into action, notifying our allies and organizing a lobbying effort aimed at U.S. House leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort paid off. The House floor schedule announced today does not include the proposed Bachmann amendment. Apparently it has been ruled out of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachmann should be ruled “out of order” often.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I hardly think it was &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; AU — a lot of people were angry about this — but anyone who contacted their representatives helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The practice involving cutting a girl’s genitals, sometimes with razors or pieces of glass, could be allowed in a clinical setting to stem illegal backyard procedures which are leaving young girls scarred for life.&lt;br&gt;
The Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians (RANZCOG) will next month discuss backing “ritual nicks”, a modified form of genital mutilation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However – a little further research  uncovered the following&lt;em&gt; – that it’s not so: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/mp/7306323/doctors-dont-support-ritual-nicking/"&gt;Doctors don’t support ‘ritual nicking’ – The West Newspaper:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The college for Australia’s obstetricians and gynecologists says it does not support the “ritual nicking” of young Muslim girls and anyone suspected of performing such genital mutilation should be reported to authorities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Ted Weaver, president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RANZCOG), said media reports suggesting the college would review its policy were the result of a misquote. He said the issue was likely to be discussed at a meeting next month, triggered by recent announcements made by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but a policy shift was not on the agenda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The college does not support – does not – support female genital mutilation, full-stop,” Dr Weaver told AAP on Friday. “This ritual nicking, as it has been called, has been put forward as a way of satisfying cultural sensitivities without making a lot of difference to a woman’s genitalia but we do not support that either.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/27/AAP.retracts.female.genital.cutting/index.html?hpt=T2"&gt;In addition, in the US,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/27/AAP.retracts.female.genital.cutting/index.html?hpt=T2"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;‘Pediatricians now reject all female genital cutting: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN) -&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics has rescinded a controversial policy statement raising the idea that doctors in some communities should be able to substitute demands for female genital cutting with a harmless clitoral “pricking” procedure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We retracted the policy because it is important that the world health community understands the AAP is totally opposed to all forms of female genital cutting, both here in the U.S. and anywhere else in the world,” said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The contentious policy statement, issued in April, had condemned the practice of female genital cutting overall. But a small portion of statement suggesting the pricking procedure riled U.S. advocacy groups and survivors of female genital cutting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/21/america.female.genital.cutting/index.html?iref=allsearch"&gt;Read about the pressures of female genital cutting in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is of interest to me, not only because I’m intrigued by &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/04/feminism-sex-science-and-getting-out-your-boobs-for-the-intertoobs/"&gt;reproductive rights and sexuality myths&lt;/a&gt; in general (you can hear an interview with Dr&lt;a href="http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=605238&amp;amp;comments=on"&gt; Petra Boynton on the Skeptic Zone podcast #78&lt;/a&gt;,  and there’ll hopefully be a transcript available for you to read very soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also because I’ve taught for a few years now to my Year 11 English students, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://embiggenbooks.com/embiggen-bookstore-welcome/general-nonfiction/autobiography/desert-flower.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Waris Diries’ book &lt;em&gt;Desert Flower. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the autobiography of a Somalian nomad who was circumcised at three, sold in marriage at thirteen, fled from Africa  to later become a  supermodel. At the age of 38, she is a UN spokeswoman against female genital mutilation (FGM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94CXTaeLJIs"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=94CXTaeLJIs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.desertflower-movie.com/"&gt;It was filmed last year as ‘Desert Flower’&lt;/a&gt; and premiered at the Venice Film Festival:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W3imc7BSzo"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W3imc7BSzo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people may already be familiar with the works of &lt;a href="http://embiggenbooks.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Ayaan+Hirsi+Ali&amp;amp;x=22&amp;amp;y=8"&gt;Ayaan Hirsi Ali, such as ‘The Caged Virgin’ and ‘Infidel’&lt;/a&gt;, but if you are looking for another very accessible text that straight-forwardly discusses the impact it has on a young woman, I’d suggest that one for the late-teens-and-above readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you may also like to send in a congratulatory note to the &lt;a href="http://www.ranzcog.edu.au/feedback.shtml"&gt;‘RANZCOG’ website for standing firm against female genital mutilation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, a blue-eyed man looking to make himself appear more dominant would be wasting his time investing in brown-coloured contact lenses. A new study by Karel Kleisner and colleagues has found that brown iris colour seems to co-occur with some other aspect of facial appearance that triggers in others the perception of dominance. Sixty-two student participants, half of them female, rated the dominance and/or attractiveness of the photographed faces of forty men and forty women, all them holding a neutral expression. Men with brown eyes were rated consistently as more dominant than blue-eyed men. No such effect of eye-colour was found for the photos of women. Eye colour also bore no association to the attractiveness ratings. Next the researchers used Photoshop to give the brown-eyed men blue eyes and the blue-eyed men brown eyes. The photos were then rated by a new batch of participants. The intriguing finding here was that the dominance ratings were left largely unaffected by the eye colour manipulation. The men who really had brown eyes, but thanks to Photoshop appeared with blue eyes, still tended to be rated as more dominant. This suggests there&amp;#39;s some other aspect of facial appearance that tends to co-occur with brown eyes, which is responsible for the perception of dominance. An analysis of the men&amp;#39;s facial configurations showed that the brown-eyed men tended to have broader, bigger chins, bigger noses, eyes closer together, and larger eye-brows than blue-eyed men, so it&amp;#39;s possible some or all of these facial features are responsible for the perception of dominance. Certainly previous research has shown that men with wider faces are perceived as more aggressive.Kleisner&amp;#39;s team can&amp;#39;t say at this point why eye colour co-occurs with certain facial features and with the appearance of being more dominant or submissive. However, one suggestion they make is that boys with blue eyes come to be seen as less dominant by a process of social feedback. &amp;#39;It is possible that subjects with blue eyes are treated as a small child for a longer period than brown-eyed children,&amp;#39; the researchers said. &amp;#39;Such early social experience may have been literally &amp;quot;inscribed&amp;quot; into their faces, preserved until adulthood, and finally bring on the perception of higher submissiveness.&amp;#39;_________________________________Kleisner, K., Kočnar, T., Rubešová, A., &amp;amp; Flegr, J.

By midweek, the anti-vaccine loons had their &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/stand_up_for_science_against_anti-vaccin.php"&gt;rally in Grant Park&lt;/a&gt;, a perfect storm of crankery in which &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/a_confluence_of_the_anti-vaccine_and_hea.php"&gt;the "health freedom" movement met the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/em&gt;, it wasn't. In any case, skeptics, despite short notice, still managed to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/stand_up_for_science_against_anti-vaccin.php"&gt;get a group together to counter the rally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autism One still has three days to go, counting today, and I thought I'd make a few observations. First, the most heartening observation is that the anti-vaccine rally, which Age of Autism and Generation Rescue promoted heavily, was basically a huge bust. People who were actually there have been sending me estimates, and, counting the speakers, volunteers, and the anti-vaccine band, the largest estimate of the number of protesters that I've seen was around 200. Most estimates were in the 100 to 150 range. Here are some pictures from the rally itself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd looks rather thin to me, even in pictures posted by &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/dr-andrew-wakefield-at-the-american-rally-for-personal-choice.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/anti-vaccination-rally-chicago-il-aka-american-rally-for-personal-rights/"&gt;Jerry Witteven&lt;/a&gt; described the turnout that he observed at the rally thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the rally, I estimated under 200 people in attendance, including some news agencies and a documentary film crew. There was a small group of pro-science folks organized by Elyse at Skepchick blog and encouraged by PZ Myers and Orac (I'm sure there were more involved).

&lt;p&gt;I want to be perfectly clear about how small "under 200″ is. I have gone to some of the most esoteric events in Chicago, ones with far less funding than the anti-vax event had yesterday, and they were far more supported than this pathetic excuse for a rally. If something is popular enough to have a following, Chicago has never disappointed me with a small crowd ... until yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's right. I lived in Chicago for three years in the late 1990s. I love Chicago. Lack of a crowd is a rare problem at a Chicago event. Most of the attendance estimates for this rally that I've seen or heard from skeptics are between 100-200, including around 30 or 40 "red shirt" volunteers (oh, how I love that they chose red shirts for the volunteer staff). The organizers were clearly expecting a much larger crowd, given the number of volunteers. (After all, what rally needs one volunteer for every four people or so?) They didn't get it. Not that that will stop anti-vaccine websites from claiming that 1,000 or more showed up. The inflated claims likely to come can go against other accounts from people who were actually there that back up the sad and utterly pathetic nature of the rally. First up, &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;The Skeptical Teacher&lt;/a&gt; describing a picture taken with Andrew Wakefield himself:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/is_the_anti-vaccine_movement_fizzling.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/is_the_anti-vaccine_movement_fizzling.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/h5zOD-EgfMU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275030251576"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5343">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad5d8992815ef3b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book Review"/><category term="Vaccines"/><category term="Andrew Wakefield"/><category term="Autism"/><category term="Brian Deer"/><category term="Callous Disregard"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><category term="Lancet"/><category term="MMR vaccine"/><title type="html">Andrew Wakefield Fights Back</title><published>2010-05-28T07:00:56Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T07:00:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5343" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Wakefield was almost single-handedly responsible for frightening the public about a possible association between autism and the MMR vaccine. His alarmist recommendations directly led to lower vaccination rates and a resurgence of measles to endemic levels in the UK. The MMR/autism interpretation of his 1998 article in &lt;cite&gt;The Lancet&lt;/cite&gt; was retracted by 10 of his 12 co-authors. The article itself was “&lt;a href="http://www.autism-watch.org/news/lancet.shtml"&gt;fully retracted from the public record” by &lt;cite&gt;The Lancet&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.   And now Wakefield has lost his license to practice medicine after the General Medical Council’s exhaustive 2½-year review of his ethical conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His career was in shreds and there was only one way left for him to fight back: to write a book. &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Callous-Disregard-Autism-Vaccines-Tragedy/dp/1616081694"&gt;Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines — The Truth Behind a Tragedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; has just been published&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I tried hard to read it with an open mind and to understand his point of view. He did make some points that I will accept as valid unless they can be refuted by the others involved. Some of what he said and did was apparently misinterpreted and distorted by his critics. But the book did not convince me that he was an ethical, rigorous scientist or that MMR is linked to autism or to bowel disease. In my opinion the book does nothing to scientifically validate his beliefs or to excuse his behavior, but rather boils down to self-serving apologetics and misleading rhetoric.  It also undermines his claim that he is a good scientist by showing that he values anecdotal evidence (“listening to the parents”) over experimental evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The preface is by Dr. Peter Fletcher of the UK’s Committee on Safety of Medicines. Some of what he says is demonstrably wrong. He alleges that vaccines have only been “minimally investigated,” that concerns about anaphylaxis have been neglected (Wakefield also stresses the danger of anaphylaxis), and that the mortality rate from MMR vaccines approaches the pre-vaccination mortality rates for measles. These allegations are ridiculous and easy to disprove with a couple of minutes’ Googling. (In &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10758692"&gt;an Australian study of 1.7 million school children vaccinated with MMR&lt;/a&gt;, there was only one anaphylactic reaction and no deaths.   Before the introduction of vaccines, &lt;a href="http://www.microbiologybytes.com/virology/mmr.html"&gt;measles used to kill 100 people in the UK every year&lt;/a&gt; and MMR vaccine has never been known to kill anyone.)  Fletcher also offers his unsupported opinion that the subjects in Wakefield’s study had “a complex new syndrome” whose root cause is “almost certainly vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreword is by Jenny McCarthy, who offers the tired old “listen to the parents” argument and calls Wakefield “the symbol of someone who stood up for truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield starts the book with an anecdote about a mother who killed herself and her autistic child: moving, but irrelevant to the questions of whether Wakefield was unethical or whether vaccines cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield does not recognize that he has done anything wrong. Instead, he accuses the regulatory authorities of callous disregard of children’s safety; he accuses his accusers of having personal motivations to destroy him and to maintain the vaccine party line at all costs; he accuses Brian Deer, the investigative reporter who exposed him, of getting the facts wrong; he accuses others of not reporting their own conflicts of interest, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He accuses the regulators and the vaccine industry of “ruthless, pragmatic exorcism of dissent” and tries to show that they are effectively anti-vaccine because they have caused the decrease in public confidence that is the greatest threat to the vaccine program. He says if consumers don’t get the answers they want (presumably a guarantee of 100% safety), they should trust their intuition, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal instinct… has been a steady hand upon the tiller of evolution; we would not be here without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not the words of a critical-thinking scientist; they sound more like something Jenny McCarthy might say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he claims that the US vaccine court has been compensating for cases of vaccine-caused autism and secretly settling cases out of court. This is not true. The only source he gives for this misinformation is  &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501263_162-4194102-501263.html"&gt;this report from CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that distorts the facts, confusing vaccine injury with encephalopathy and mitochondrial disorders with injury from autism. In reality, &lt;a href="http://www.autism-watch.org/omnibus/overview.shtml"&gt;the vaccine court has evaluated the best test cases lawyers could come up with&lt;/a&gt; and has determined that there is no evidence for vaccines causing autism.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stresses that the paper itself did not claim that MMR caused autism. That’s true. The problem was not the paper itself, but Wakefield’s interpretation of it in his press conference, where he advised against the MMR and recommended single vaccines instead. His comments at that press conference were what led to the public rejection of MMR vaccines and the resurgence of measles in the UK. He devotes a whole chapter to the press conference. He gets bogged down in minutiae about what the dean thought he was going to say and who knew or said what and when. He cannot justify his recommendation of single vaccines instead of the combined MMR, and he doesn’t address the fact that he had filed &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm"&gt;a patent application for his own single measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a clear conflict of interest that he failed to disclose.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a whole chapter on the UK government’s delay in rejecting a particular brand of MMR vaccine that had been withdrawn in Canada. That episode says nothing about vaccines and autism and is not justification for Wakefield’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He denies that the lawyer funded the 1998 &lt;cite&gt;Lancet &lt;/cite&gt; study, but admits that the lawyer was already funding a related measles virus study of Wakefield’s at the time. He offers convoluted explanations of how the subjects came to him. He denies that they were sent by the lawyer or that they were litigants at the time of the study. While that may be technically true, Wakefield was already known for his criticism of the MMR vaccine and for his hypotheses about measles virus and bowel disorders, and he readily admits that his reputation led a network of concerned activists to direct patients to him. These were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; simply patients who presented to the clinic in the normal course of things. He says he was not required to report this sort of thing as a conflict of interest under the rules in effect at that time, but that the rules subsequently changed. Whether it was a requirement or not, it is something I would have wanted to know when I originally read the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He still doesn’t understand what was wrong about paying children to let him draw blood samples at his son’s birthday party. He doesn’t understand why scientists don’t usually use “samples of convenience” like this for a control group, and he doesn’t understand the element of coercion. He doesn’t even have the decency to apologize for making fun of the children in public, joking about them crying, fainting, and vomiting. He just doesn’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tries to claim that doing invasive procedures like colonoscopies and lumbar punctures (LPs) on the subjects in his study was not for research but something that should have been done on every autistic child for the child’s clinical benefit. He doesn’t make a convincing case. Certainly the majority of clinicians who evaluate autistic children do not do these studies routinely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that autism must not have existed in 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century Paris because Charcot did not describe it!  He implies that the rise in autism was temporally associated with the introduction of MMR vaccine; but a recent study showed that the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1927415,00.html"&gt;prevalence of autism in adults&lt;/a&gt; was equal to that in children and did not decrease with age, even in those over 70 who were far too old to have been exposed to any of the modern children’s vaccines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says his findings of a new gastrointestinal syndrome related to measles virus and autism have been replicated around the world. They have not. He cites a few papers that seem to support his hypothesis but fails to cite the bulk of data that refutes it. For instance &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19651585"&gt;this study showed no association between autism and overall incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19535465"&gt;This one showed no autism/GI connection either.&lt;/a&gt;  And &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18769550"&gt;this study showed strong evidence &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; association of autism with persistent measles virus RNA in the GI tract or with MMR exposure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tries to demolish the GMC’s case against him. If he could do so in a book, one can only wonder why he didn’t present his evidence at the hearing. He goes into excruciating, mind-numbing detail about points that are really peripheral to the central issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dissects a newspaper article by Brian Deer, but most of what he calls “false allegations” amount to trivial nitpicking about wording or interpretation. Some of it is reminiscent of a certain former president’s quibbling about what the meaning of the word “is” is. Deer made many other allegations in his exposés that Wakefield does not mention or attempt to refute, such as the apparent attempt to hide his source of funding (for a different study?) by funneling the lawyer’s payments through a company of Wakefield’s wife. There are many unanswered questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most unfortunate chapter in the book is “Poisoning Young Minds,” a prime example of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin&amp;#39;s_law"&gt;Godwin’s law&lt;/a&gt;. He describes how a math question in schools in Nazi Germany used Jews as an example, thereby sowing the seeds of anti-Semitic propaganda into young, fertile Aryan minds. He compares this to a question on a UK biology exam that used Wakefield’s study as an example, asking students whether it was reliable scientific evidence or might have been biased. This takes up a whole chapter! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his concluding epilogue, he says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the battle for the hearts and minds of the public, you have already lost… Why? Because the parents are right; their stories are true; their children’s brains are damaged; there is a major, major problem. In the US, increasingly coercive vaccine mandates and fear-mongering campaigns are a measure of your failure — vaccine uptake is not a reflection of public confidence, but of these coercive measures, and without public confidence, you have nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ludicrous: he is clearly the one who undermined public confidence, not the scientists and agencies that are doing their best to reduce the incidence of preventable diseases and to protect the public from alarmists like him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the whole book is an embarrassing, tedious, puerile, and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at damage control. Wakefield has been thoroughly discredited in the scientific arena and he is reduced to seeking a second opinion from the public. Perhaps he thinks that the truth can be determined by a popularity contest. Perhaps he thinks the future will look back at him as a persecuted genius like Galileo or Semmelweis. Jenny McCarthy thinks so; I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

That's right.  The study of vomiting, hangovers, blackouts, and other stupid stuff you did in college.

(Including when you wore this shirt around because you wanted to be as cool as this guy)

Actually, this paper does have some interesting correlations for people who study alcoholism and binge drinking, but for the moment, it's about drunk college students.  We'll get to the rest of it at the end.

After the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/whatever_happened_to_first_do.php"&gt;outrage over a prior policy statement&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/27/AAP.retracts.female.genital.cutting/index.html?hpt=T2"&gt;AAP has revised and clarified their position on female genital mutilation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics has rescinded a controversial policy statement raising the idea that doctors in some communities should be able to substitute demands for female genital cutting with a harmless clitoral "pricking" procedure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"We retracted the policy because it is important that the world health community understands the AAP is totally opposed to all forms of female genital cutting, both here in the U.S. and anywhere else in the world," said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The contentious policy statement, issued in April, had condemned the practice of female genital cutting overall. But a small portion of statement suggesting the pricking procedure riled U.S. advocacy groups and survivors of female genital cutting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a rumor going about that the Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians was going to consider the practicality of supporting that clitoral &amp;quot;pricking&amp;quot; business — fortunately, it is not true and the &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/05/letting-desert-flowers-bloom-ranzcog-does-not-support-female-genital-mutilation/"&gt;RANZCOG is just as forthright in rejecting the procedure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_retraction_from_the_american.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/uv5sLOX9qYE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275020680868"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/it_would_make_our_start-of-the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4811bf4c9f68a29</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">It would make our start-of-the-year faculty orientation meetings interesting, anyway</title><published>2010-05-28T02:17:30Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T02:17:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/_VPoUJvvDS8/it_would_make_our_start-of-the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/it_would_make_our_start-of-the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Muslim cleric thought he'd discovered a loophole in Islamic religious law that would &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6681511.stm"&gt;allow the restrictions on Muslim women in the workplace to be loosened&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that if a woman fed a male colleague "directly from her breast" at least five times they would establish a family bond and thus be allowed to be alone together at work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting, and does not ban marriage," he ruled.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"A woman at work can take off the veil or reveal her hair in front of someone whom she breastfed." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when you think the Abrahamic attitude towards women couldn&amp;#39;t get weirder or more demeaning…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To their credit, nobody seems to have taken this fatwa at all seriously, and it has been decreed a bad interpretation of Islamic law. Now they just have to take the next step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt's minister of religious affairs, Mahmoud Zaqzouq, has called for future fatwas to "be compatible with logic and human nature". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that's an end to all fatwas, then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/it_would_make_our_start-of-the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_VPoUJvvDS8" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275020680868"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_successful_protest_in_chicag.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a97731ae7e08170e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">A successful protest in Chicago</title><published>2010-05-28T02:05:02Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T02:05:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/bF3RF3SoTTA/a_successful_protest_in_chicag.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_successful_protest_in_chicag.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was an anti-vaccination rally yesterday in Chicago — boring and silly! What&amp;#39;s more interesting is that &lt;a href="http://shop.womenthinkingfree.org/"&gt;Women Thinking Free&lt;/a&gt; (a fabulous new organization) had a counter-demonstration. You can read an &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/anti-vaccination-rally-chicago-il-aka-american-rally-for-personal-rights/"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/my-day-at-an-anti-vaccination-rally/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; of the event from the rational perspective; it sounds like the anti-vaxers are also anti-science. The rally and anti-rally also made the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/05/two-sides-in-vaccine-safety-debate-converge-on-chicago.html"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, and that's actually a good account, which plainly states that there is no evidence of a link between autism and vaccination, that Wakefield's study was flawed, and that Wakefield has had his license to practice medicine revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m troubled by one thing. The theme of the literature the smart people were handing out was &amp;quot;Hug me — I&amp;#39;m vaccinated&amp;quot;, and they&amp;#39;ve got a photo of Wakefield hugging one of the skeptics, which is safe, because they&amp;#39;ve had their shots. But has Wakefield? Has anybody asked him if he&amp;#39;s up to date on his vaccinations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might have infected him with skepticism, you know. Or he might have been swarming with kook cooties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_successful_protest_in_chicag.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/bF3RF3SoTTA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275020135566"><id gr:original-id="http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/ardipithecus-drama/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d1f5b64e3406c632</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Ardipithecus Drama!</title><published>2010-05-27T21:42:38Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T21:42:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/sXO2uTWUNl4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/ardipithecus-drama/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Ooooo, is there some Ardi drama today!  Two technical comments were published in science which question the conclusions reached by Tim White and his team in last September’s Ardi blitz.  The comment by Esteban Sarmiento was particularly interesting, particularly this quote: In contrast to what the authors describe in other papers, the LCA character conditions [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

So was Charles Ives. Bobby Jones was an amateur. Bill Tilden was an amateur, at least until he was 37 or 38. Wallace Stevens and Emily Dickinson were amateurs. According to Publisher’s Weekly, so is Mark Sumner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumner is the author of the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Everything-Selection-Culture-Commerce/dp/0982417160/" rel="external "&gt;The Evolution of Everything&lt;/a&gt;: How Selection Shapes Culture, Commerce, and Nature&lt;/em&gt;. It is difficult to classify this book, but if I had to do so, I would say that it not only tells the history of natural selection in biology but also relates it to business and commerce. And it does so in an interesting, compelling way: Even though I thought I knew something about the contents of many of the chapters, Sumner managed to introduce some tidbit, some wrinkle that I did not know into virtually every discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book presents a very readable history of the theory of evolution, beginning long before its conception as a fully fledged theory, passing through Darwin’s and Wallace’s theories and Mendel’s laws, and on to the modern synthesis and punctuated equilibrium. Sumner is especially hard on Spencer’s social Darwinism, Galton’s eugenics, and Haeckel’s racism, and he makes very clear that these are not consequences of Darwin’s ideas but rather perversions. Social Darwinism, for example, has nothing to do with Darwin and was no more than a device to justify the class structure or social order as it existed at the time; the rich and powerful were rich and powerful because they deserved to be rich and powerful. No such conclusion can reasonably be justified by natural selection, which is entirely descriptive and not at all prescriptive. Indeed, social Darwinism or its equivalent long predates Darwin himself; it was merely the most recent successor to the divine right of kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francis Galton, who was a cousin to Darwin and an important mathematician, took social Darwinism one step further and advocated human breeding by artificial selection. Sumner details how his eugenics led to atrocities such as forced sterilization of people perceived to be mentally handicapped. According to Sumner, Keynes, Wells, Shaw, Churchill, and Woodrow Wilson were all taken in by eugenics. As he says, those in power “were not just richer than the people who work for them—they were better. Genuinely superior right down to every cell of their bodies.” Sumner is correct, however, in his assertion that the eugenicists (not to mention the Nazis) have it exactly wrong; a failure to interbreed leads to weaker stock, not stronger. He deftly uses the banana to make his point: for the first half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, there was primarily one kind of commercial banana, the gros Michel.  Commercial bananas had virtually no genetic diversity and the gros Michels were wiped out by a fungus infection. It took years to replace them with the Cavendish banana, which is the major commercial banana sold today. The Cavendish is now threatened by a similar fungus. I could not help wondering what &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch" rel="external "&gt;Ray Comfort &lt;/a&gt; would have made of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sumner is on somewhat shakier ground when he tries to apply natural selection to manufacturing and commerce. In a chapter that is concerned with the (biological) horse, he also discusses the Ford Mustang. The Mustang, he says, was not especially fast, not especially sporty. But it was attractive and inexpensive and evidently filled a niche. Whereas Ford’s marketing department predicted sales of 100,000 Mustangs in its first year of production, in fact the company sold 1 million in the first year and a half. The car speciated and grew larger for several years, just like biological organisms. Then came the oil embargo in 1973, and many of the Mustang’s competitors disappeared. The Mustang, however, had speciated only months before, this time to a smaller, snazzier model. Of all the “pony cars,” as Sumner dubs them, only the Mustang survived. Sumner likens the survival of the Mustang to the survival of the real horse, the genus &lt;em&gt;Equus&lt;/em&gt;, both of which simply happened to have the right stuff to survive when their respective ecologies changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the Mustang is a good yarn, and it is one of many. I suspect Sumner’s interpretation is correct, and I hope that he can help to inject a little selectionism into economics. But his work will be criticized in much the same way as sociobiology is criticized: it is easy to make up stories but hard to gather evidence to support them. Indeed, his claim that the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius are examples of convergent evolution would be more convincing if the designers of the Insight had never seen a Prius, or for that matter if the designers of the Prius had never seen the old 2-seater Insight. Nevertheless, Sumner’s stories have a ring of truth to them, and it seems to me that a large number of detailed, carefully constructed stories may be considered to have explanatory power (provided that you could not construct the opposite story if the opposite had happened). But then, I suspect that if I were a biologist, I would be considered an extreme adaptationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last chapter in the book was one of the more interesting. Here Sumner examines a headline that says that, according to a Gallup poll, 4 in 10 people believe in evolution. The headline is presumably correct, but what is omitted is that 4 in 10 (39 %, in fact) was a plurality, and only 25 % disbelieved in evolution. The other 36 % had no opinion. Sumner says that the headline should have stated that only 1 in 4 does not believe in evolution. And, in case you thought that decisions about scientific matters were made on an intellectual level, Sumner describes a poll question of his own: “Do you believe that America and Africa were once part of the same continent?” Guess what? 50 % of people in the Northeast answered yes and 32 % in the South, with intermediate numbers in the Midwest and West. Those who answered “not sure” were about constant at 31-33 % across all regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did not like about this splendid book: It is an anthology, and I think all of the chapters were originally published as essays or blog entries in the Daily Kos. They all have the same formula: start with an anecdote, don’t tell where you are going, proceed with your main point, then conclude by in effect finishing the anecdote. The formula may work on isolated blog entries, especially if the other reporters do not constantly use that formula, but by the time I got halfway through the book, I was tired of it and kept gnashing my teeth and exclaiming, “Tell your readers where you are going!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I return to the anecdote with which I began this essay. I do not believe that Publisher’s Weekly was being complimentary when it called Sumner an amateur. All I can say in response is, I should be such an amateur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I saw a prepublication copy of this book and wrote a blurb for the back cover. Mr. Sumner very kindly &lt;a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~mmyoung/SumnerReview.pdf" rel="external "&gt;reviewed my book&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/" rel="external "&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-scumbag1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wakefield scumbag" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-scumbag1.jpg?w=435&amp;amp;h=326" alt="" width="435" height="326"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two skeptical ninjas shown here on either side of Andrew “Douchebag” Wakefield are Jamie Bernstein and Bruce Critelli.  In the words of another of my skeptical colleagues, these two “are the mayors of Balls City!”  Indeed &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/my-day-at-an-anti-vaccination-rally/"&gt;Jamie recounts her experience of the rally over at The Friendly Atheist&lt;/a&gt; – feel free to follow Jamie via Twitter .@UAJamie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vimeo.com/12084050"&gt;Bruce shares some really interesting video he shot at the rally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Bruce’s video, the most unnerving part was, to me, &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/12079650"&gt;a story that Wakefield told&lt;/a&gt; the “crowd” (less than 100 people is hardly a crowd) with one woman who was talking about her son…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 15 years ago a mother from London approached him and said “Do not  judge me too harshly Dr.  Wakefield, but when I die I am taking my son  with me. You see, I’m all  he has. I’m the only one who loves him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t judge,” said  Wakefield. “I was moved by the love that a  mother must have for her  child that she would take his life rather than  have him fall upon a  society that really didn’t give a damn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Holy shit.  I had no idea Wakefield had gone so far down the rabbit-hole of woo – either he’s gone off the deep-end of being a true-believer, or he’s a completely callous charlatan trying to salvage some sense of credibility by bilking the desperate &amp;amp; gullible (probably both, in my opinion).  He seems to be doubling-down on the crazy, actually telling people that he &lt;em&gt;supports&lt;/em&gt; the idea of this woman “taking her son with her” when she dies, just because he’s autistic and “society doesn’t give a damn” because it recommends vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield is nuts… just plain nuts.  That, and he’s damned dangerous.  It is somehow fitting that only a few people showed up to see him speak, and it attests to his fringe status.  Of course, it’s also a little disconcerting to see that he could actually rally even 100 people to show up and hang on his every word, as if he’s some kind of modern-day guru.  Spooky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are more links to photos &amp;amp; blog posts about the event…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/a_successful_protest_in_chicag.php"&gt;It’s been Pharyngulated! &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/is_the_anti-vaccine_movement_fizzling.php"&gt;Orac, scourge of anti-vaxxers everywhere, chimes in with a great analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/d4v3r5/sets/72157624145575804/"&gt;Skeptic Dave took a lot of nice photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/the-american-rally-for-personal-rights-bit-of-a-damp-squib/"&gt;This UK blog notes the lackluster attendance at the rally despite Wakefield’s “star power”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1015"&gt;Anti-vax rally fizzles&lt;/a&gt; – I really like the closing on this one…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rally organizers clearly expected much larger crowds, as evidenced by  dozens of anti-vaccine signs still unused by 5 pm, when the park  started to clear out. A sign-in sheet listed about 35 names and email  addresses. Hundreds of free bananas remained unclaimed, and most of the  vendors’ tables that surrounded one side of the quad remained empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of city carried on as normal. In this case, that  was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just in case anyone on the anti-vax side claims those of us grounded in reality of painting Wakefield and his rally in a bad light due to poor attendance, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/dr-andrew-wakefield-at-the-american-rally-for-personal-choice.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e20133ef113b6f970b"&gt;take a look at this post over at the anti-vax Age of Autism website.&lt;/a&gt; Check out these pictures…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-rally1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wakefield rally1" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-rally1.jpg?w=350&amp;amp;h=467" alt="" width="350" height="467"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-rally2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wakefield rally2" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-rally2.jpg?w=350&amp;amp;h=467" alt="" width="350" height="467"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Promising findings commonly cannot be replicated in independent samples.  There could be several potential explanations for this scenario.1.) There may be no genetic contributions to risk and findings represent random effects2.) Genetic effects are complex, due to multiple genes or explain only a small amount of the risk variance for the disorders3.) The psychiatric diagnostic categories are inherently flawed or unreliable across institutions or investigatorsDeo and colleagues present a study of tackling the third explanation in a study published in the March issue of Plos.  They start by not accepting the historical classification strategy for psychosis and affective disorder.  Instead, their approach examines grouping cases by key behavior symptoms independent of psychiatric diagnostic classification.  In this approach a group of patients are rated on a series of key behavior symptoms and an algorithm is used for behavioral and genetic network analysis.  Patients may include several diagnostic groups and specific behavior symptoms may be found across diagnostic categories.  This algorithm approach was applied to a real dataset from a schizophrenia study as well as a simulated genetics dataset known as the GAW14.  The key findings from the study included:1.) Four distinct behavioral groups were identified from the schizophrenia dataset--two groups resembled depression and two groups resembled schizophrenia2.) One depression group was characterized by the key symptoms of concentration problems with support for linkage to chromosome 2q353.) The second depression group showed sleep disturbance as a dominating symptom and  had a lower linkage signal to specific gene regions4.) A schizophrenia group characterized by language symptoms showed a linkage signal to chromosome 2q255.) A second schizophrenia group with concentration problems, mood symptoms, suicidal ideation and psychomotor retardation yielded maximum linkage signal on chromosome 2p216.) Using the simulated dataset, the algorithm identified genetic factors tied to latent phenotypes with a degree of resolution not attainable with other existing strategiesThe authors note this approach could also use physiological trait measurements as well as environmental factors in the grouping algorithm.   For example, fMRI findings or neuropsychological performance could be used to enhance the grouping accuracy.This approach is exciting and may improve our understanding the genetic contributions to a variety of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition, it may prove useful in improving psychiatric diagnosis by better defining the key variables to define more homogenous groups.  Improved classification using this more dimensional approach may inform more effective treatment strategies.Photo of Lake Itasca Trumpeter Swans Courtesy of Yates PhotographyDeo AJ, Costa R, DeLisi LE, DeSalle R, &amp;amp; Haghighi F (2010).

&lt;p&gt;The event is sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=125522418890"&gt;DePaul University Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — an exciting new group that began this past year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s one more reason to come!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m taking my last grad school final just hours prior to that — I’ll finally have my Master’s Degree &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   It’s been five years since I started the Math Ed program at DePaul, so it’s about damn time.  There will be some sort of fun celebration afterwards for anyone interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: Next year, I’m gonna make all my students call me Master Mehta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note 2: Look at “&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/photo//100524/480/urn_publicid_ap_org89bb8c118b90406494fa8cf0cd0f1811/"&gt;classroom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/photo//100524/480/urn_publicid_ap_org43d651f4f6ba42fd99735498ea2cd682/"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;” in &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/photo//100524/480/urn_publicid_ap_org0f0f517c3f794d6d932a5495d4de13ff/"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their circular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth." -&lt;i&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When you look up at the stars in the night sky, perhaps the most striking thing that they do is rotate about either the North or South Pole, depending on which hemisphere you live in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/startrails11h_hambsch_c90.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/startrails11h_hambsch_c90-thumb-500x353-49924.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="startrails11h_hambsch_c90.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do you get if you look up at the same &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; each evening, night after night?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/retrogrademars03_tezel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/retrogrademars03_tezel-thumb-500x380-49926.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="retrogrademars03_tezel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unlike the planets Mars (in red) and Uranus (faint, to the upper right of Mars), the stars stay in the same exact spot from night to night.  Yes, they're moving, but they move far too slowly for how far away they are to detect their motion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how would you determine how far away a star is?  Well, if your name was Nicolaus Copernicus, you'd look up at the positions of the stars at one night, and you'd look up six months later, and see if any of the stars have moved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you do that?  Play along with me for a moment.  Close your left eye, and hold your right arm out straight, with your thumb pointing up.  Pay close attention to where your thumb appears to be relative to everything around you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/Photo%20on%202010-05-27%20at%2016.45%20%232.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/Photo%20on%202010-05-27%20at%2016.45%20%232-thumb-500x375-49930.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Photo on 2010-05-27 at 16.45 #2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it?  Good.  Now, leaving your thumb in the same exact spot, open your left eye and close your right eye.  Notice where your thumb appears to be now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/Photo%20on%202010-05-27%20at%2016.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/Photo%20on%202010-05-27%20at%2016.45-thumb-500x375-49932.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Photo on 2010-05-27 at 16.45.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears to move!  You can play with this all you like, but you'll not only notice your thumb always moves when you switch eyes, it appears to move by a &lt;b&gt;fixed number of degrees&lt;/b&gt; dependent on two things only: how far away your thumb is from your eyes and how far apart your eyes are!  In astronomy, we call this &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax"&gt;parallax&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/Negative%20Parallax.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/Negative%20Parallax-thumb-500x500-49928.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="Negative Parallax.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the stars now.  When you make an observation of the stars, your eyes are way too close together to see any sort of "apparent shift" of a star.  In fact, the diameter of the Earth is far too small!  But Copernicus, realizing that the Earth goes around the Sun, would have seen his position shift, over the course of six months, by about &lt;b&gt;300 million kilometers&lt;/b&gt;!  So, he reasoned, he should be able to see the closest stars in a different apparent position, like so:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/using-parallax-distance-to-star.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/using-parallax-distance-to-star-thumb-500x403-49934.png" width="500" height="403" alt="using-parallax-distance-to-star.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Copernicus didn't see anything because &lt;i&gt;the telescope hadn't been invented yet&lt;/i&gt;!  The first astronomical parallax wasn't discovered until 1838, and that was by &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AGM....14..J01B"&gt;Friedrich Bessel&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/bessel%5B1%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_nearest_star/bessel%5B1%5D-thumb-500x422-49936.jpg" width="500" height="422" alt="bessel[1].jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And yes, for those of you who are wondering, it's the same guy who did &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function"&gt;Bessel Functions&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you can measure the parallax of stars, the one with the largest parallax will be the closest one to you.  (And if you want the answer, it's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri"&gt;Proxima Centauri&lt;/a&gt;, at 4.2 light-years distance.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you lived before 1838?  What if you still wanted to know the distance to the stars; would you have any recourse?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/%287-01%29Huygens.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/%287-01%29Huygens-thumb-500x540-49938.jpg" width="500" height="540" alt="(7-01)Huygens.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until the mid-1600s did someone -- Christiaan Huygens -- make some great progress on that front.  Huygens was already famous for inventing the pendulum clock and discovering Saturn's rings and its great Moon, Titan.  But the stars were another story.  Huygens' big idea was that the stars in the sky were identical to our Sun, but much farther away.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/article-1080240-0155225D00001005-84_468x412.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/article-1080240-0155225D00001005-84_468x412-thumb-500x440-49940.jpg" width="500" height="440" alt="article-1080240-0155225D00001005-84_468x412.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he knew how bright the Sun was and how far away it was, he reasoned that if he chose the &lt;i&gt;brightest&lt;/i&gt; star in the sky and was able to figure out its brightness relative to the Sun's, he could figure out its distance!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he found the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, and studied it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/sirius-z.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/sirius-z-thumb-500x321-49942.jpg" width="500" height="321" alt="sirius-z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, he went and took a large brass plate and drilled holes of different sizes in it.  He held the disc up at arms length, covering the Sun entirely.  Well, except for the holes he drilled in it!  And so he studied the tiny bit of Sun poking through the holes, looking at progressively smaller and smaller holes until he found one that matched Sirius.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/7-sun-through-pine-needles.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/7-sun-through-pine-needles-thumb-500x375-49944.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="7-sun-through-pine-needles.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that was the plan.  It didn't work, though.  No matter how small he made the holes, the tiny bit of Sun that shone through was always significantly brighter than Sirius!  So what did he do?  He went out and got a bunch of opaque glass beads, reducing the amount of light that came through even further.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn't until he reduced the amount of light coming from the Sun by a factor of about &lt;b&gt;800 million&lt;/b&gt; that he was satisfied.  This meant that -- roughly -- this star was 28,000 times farther away than the Sun was from Earth!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/3_0591d2003dd461b9505270560c91a33a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars/3_0591d2003dd461b9505270560c91a33a-thumb-500x405-49946.jpg" width="500" height="405" alt="3_0591d2003dd461b9505270560c91a33a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work this out in modern units, his estimate comes out to about 0.4 light years.  But if you head on over to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, it'll tell you (correctly) that Sirius is &lt;b&gt;8.7 light years&lt;/b&gt; away.  But it will &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; tell you that Sirius, intrinsically, is &lt;b&gt;25 times more luminous&lt;/b&gt; than the Sun is!  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you know something about how intrinsically bright a star is, you can figure out how distant it is &lt;b&gt;without a telescope&lt;/b&gt;, and just by creatively destroying one of your dishes!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/how_far_to_the_stars.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275007176278"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=16415">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/97e47c1bd01e04eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Air Force"/><category term="scramjet"/><category term="X-51A"/><title type="html">Followup: Scramjet test a success</title><published>2010-05-28T00:19:59Z</published><updated>2010-05-28T00:19:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/cyDg39iCugA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/27/followup-scramjet-test-a-success/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/airforce_scramjet.jpg" alt="airforce_scramjet" title="airforce_scramjet" width="300" height="252"&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=10756873"&gt;ABC news is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the Air Force tested &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/24/what-is-the-air-force-doing-with-space/"&gt;the X-51A scramjet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and that it successfully fired for 200 seconds, blowing away — literally — the previous record of 12 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

As you might imagine, I'm &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/run_dont_walk_from_these_doctors.php"&gt;not impressed with the quality&lt;/a&gt; of the medical information that is dispensed on this show. It's everything I hate about glitzed up medicine as TV entertainment, particularly the vacuously beautiful hosts. I thought Dr. Stork and his merry band of bubble-brained doctors had hit their low point, but I was wrong. Earlier this week, they appeared to be extolling the claimed virtues of (or at least not treating particularly skeptically the claims for)--of all things--urine therapy. Don't believe me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's &lt;a href="http://thedoctorstv.com/main/procedure_list/1793"&gt;go to the tape&lt;/a&gt; (not to mention some rather amusing commentary by &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5549575/these-doctors-think-you-should-drink-urine"&gt;Gawker&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when I thought The Doctors couldn't get any worse, damn if they don't go and prove me wrong! Yes, that's The Doctors apparently drinking urine. Even if that's not urine (it doesn't quite look the right color, even for highly concentrated urine) and they're just making it look as though they're drinking urine, it's a cheap stunt. Personally, I'd have preferred it if it were real urine they were dabbing on their skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/stick_a_fork_in_these_doctors.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/cASTyfsFuVo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1275005695683"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5344">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/06c89f1483ce81a2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health Fraud"/><category term="Medical Ethics"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Lying Liars and their Lying Lies</title><published>2010-05-27T19:00:59Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T19:00:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5344" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle said “a lie cannot live.” It shows that he did not know how to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:.9em;color:#444;margin-left:30%"&gt;— Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an infamous hoax from last century called &lt;cite&gt;The Protocols of the (Learned) Elders of Zion&lt;/cite&gt;, an anti-Semitic text purporting to describe a plan to achieve global domination by the Jewish people. Despite the fact that the &lt;cite&gt;Protocols&lt;/cite&gt; is a work of fiction, there have been and still are folks who believe it to be real, from Hitler on down. (Or is that “on up”?  Can one be lower than Hitler?  And have I already committed a breach of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin"&gt;Godwin’s Law?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inventing apparently legitimate information is a useful propaganda device not limited to anti-Semites.  Having people appear evil or uncaring using their own words is far more effective than calling them evil and uncaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many in the community who suffer from a variety of complaints that I cannot diagnose, and, as people do not like uncertainty about their health, they will find someone who &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; give them a diagnosis.  Not infrequently they will come upon the idea of chronic Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think that the data supports the concept of chronic Lyme disease, and being a Tool of the Medical Industrial Complex (TMIC®), that is just what you would expect me to say.  But despite the paucity of data to support chronic Lyme, there is a contingent of patients and doctors who feel that the disease is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the battle to win the hearts and minds of those who are unconvinced about chronic Lyme, those in favor of the syndrome have several options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.3333px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) They could argue the science.&lt;/strong&gt; That would be a losing technique as the totality of the published literature is against them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would rather tell seven lies than make one explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:.9em;color:#444;margin-left:30%"&gt;— Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.3333px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) They could demonize the opposition.&lt;/strong&gt; If the speaker is an evil TMIC, then the speaker’s message is evil as well.  You are more likely to dismiss the message if you can dismiss the messenger. Certainly anything Rush Gore says is automatically nonsense since Rush Gore is a moron at best and evil at worst.  It is a simple and common mental shortcut.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doctors still have a degree of respect, deserved or not, in society.  I think mostly deserved.  Most of the people I work with are caring, compassionate people who work hard for the betterment of their patients.  Not all. But most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can call me a TMIC, but it will not stick most of the time.  The process of calling people names can make the caller look petty, especially of they do it without cleverness. &lt;em&gt;I am made of rubber, you are made of glue, what bounces off of me, sticks to you.&lt;/em&gt; It is true at 5 and at 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glory which is built upon a lie soon becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance. How easy it is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo that work again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:.9em;color:#444;margin-left:30%"&gt;— Mark Twain, &lt;cite&gt;Eruption&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be better is to find examples of your opposition being a TMIC and display it for all the world to see.  Hoist them on their own petard (a Star Trek reference; you  have not enjoyed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petard"&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; unless you have read it in the original Klingon).  What if you can’t find examples?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where you become a lying liar using lying lies.  The Internet era makes it easy to rapidly transmit information.  What often seems to be lacking is the ability for people to take just a little bit of time to fact check the information they get. People do not bother to double check the truthiness of the information they get.  Hoax’s propagate endlessly on the interwebs, ranging from &lt;a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl-marvin-keeshan.htm"&gt;Captain Kangaroo’s war record&lt;/a&gt; to Nigerian money transfers.  All easy to fact check.  It is easier to believe what you read, especially if it supports you prior convictions.  And lies are forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking differences between a cat and a lie is that a cat has only nine lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size:.9em;color:#444;margin-left:30%"&gt;— Pudd’nhead Wilson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PalMD  received an open letter from the IDSA about Lyme disease and he thought it smelled funny, and not &lt;em&gt;ha ha&lt;/em&gt; funny. More like &lt;em&gt;boiling melana&lt;/em&gt; funny. PalMD has a good nose, and a quick email to the IDSA confirmed the letter is a hoax.  I am sure that many will get a copy of this letter and be angered at their suffering being called delusional. If I thought  I had chronic Lyme and read the tripe that follows, it would fry my bacon.  Most will not bother to check the legitimacy of the letter.  It is, in a word, a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lie can travel halfway round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Letter to the Mental Health Community from the Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 24, 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delusional Chronic Lyme Syndrome (DCLS) affects tens of thousands of new victims every year.  This debilitating mental illness is destroying the emotional and financial livelihood of families across our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), we see firsthand the damage inflicted by this illness.  Its sufferers frequently seek medical help from our member’s practices;  however, we are powerless to cure its underlying roots, as this mental illness exists well outside our domain knowledge of pathogens and human infection.  Therefore, we are strenuously imploring the mental health community to take up research action in earnest.  After our Lyme disease treatment review panel concluded last month, it is now indisputably self-evident that DCLS has reached epidemic proportions and its yearly growth rate is alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historical duration, demographic breadth, and geographical extent of this mass psychogenic illness is a fascinating and unprecedented event in the history of our country, perhaps in the history of mankind.  It has persisted for four decades, affects all ages, and exhibits an intriguing geographic clustering phenomenon.  The intensity of its delusions drives sufferers to such extremes as self-mutilation via catheterization and sometimes suicide.  Currently, there is no formal diagnostic classification or treatment regimen for DCLS.  Meanwhile, this is empowering opportunistic medical doctors to prescribe improper and costly pharmaceutical treatment. This only furthers delays patients from seeking out the mental health professionals they so desperately need. Unfortunately, general awareness within the mental health field is virtually nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As president of the IDSA, I bear some responsibility for this ignorance, by not encouraging more cross-discipline pollination of our medical information.  As this crisis has illuminated, the IDSA has not been true to its stated core value to “promote collaboration and cooperation among other professional colleagues.”  In response, I passionately pledge to our members and public constituents to reverse this myopic trend within our esteemed organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDSA member, Dr. Gary Wormser, has been a tireless crusader in promoting awareness of this emerging illness.  I owe him immense gratitude for keeping true to his values as a physician in the face of sometimes caustic opposition to his fresh ideas.  We beseech mental health researchers to carry on the torch ignited by Dr. Wormser and create pervasive, national recognition for this destructive disorder.  By doing so, you will bring hope and compassion to those afflicted by this strange and insidious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To actualize this crucial transfer of information, the IDSA will be hosting free workshops on DCLS for mental health professionals at our upcoming annual meeting.  This meeting will be hosted on October 21st through 24th, 2010 in Vancouver, Canada.  We look forward to bringing the mental health community up-to-date on all relevant research and known data for DCLS.  For more information, please contact the DCLS workshop coordinator at (xxx) 299-0200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard J. Whitley, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What I found was a pun-fest of scholarly research, and I&amp;#39;m left intensely curious about who funded this research.  Ironically enough, at the time I came across the post I was listening to an auto-swung version of Metallica&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Enter the Sandman&amp;quot; (songs run through a rather neat Python script to swing them*).When Toaster was a young whelp in The Ozarks, it eventually came to that time in his life where he, like every young person in America, is contractually obliged to find something to annoy the hell out of their parents and stubbornly persist at it until they move out.  Rather than drink illicit alcohol** and crash cars into trees, I chose to join a death metal band playing bass.  As a direct result of this, I began listening to a lot more heavy metal music and going to concerts.  I was never much for headbanging*** because being a wallflower is more fun, but I saw a lot of other people pursue it aggressively like a cocaine-addicted lab rat and I noted that over time these people gradually became a bit dimmer than they&amp;#39;d been when I met them.  They were also almost always much less coordinated after they&amp;#39;d been to a concert.This paper developed a mathematical model to explain why my peers were left so hammered after headbanging so much as they did.  They analyzed the way people move when they headbang and developed an equation for a sinusoidal wave to describe peoples&amp;#39; head movements during headbanging and subsequently estimated the level of force experienced as described by the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) from the angular velocity of headbanging heads.  Although the HIC projects serious injury is only likely to occur at rates of head movement/collision over 15m^2/s.  However, since headbanging is a repetitive motion, they chose, with evidence, to evaluate any rate over 8m^2/s as potentially injurious.  This means that the faster you headbang and the wider angle of motion your head travels through as you do so, the more likely you are to hurt your brain.Now the methods get a bit strange.  Not only did the researchers attend a couple metal concerts to observe headbangers in their natural element, but they also analyzed the way that the &amp;quot;legendary&amp;quot; headbanging duos Beavis and Butthead and Wayne and Garth headbanged.  They concluded that Butthead was the one most likely to be injuring himself.However, I drew some issue with the music they were calling metal.  From the period of my youth described above, I considered such bands as In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Strapping Young Lad, and their doomy ilk to be metal.  I&amp;#39;d never considered AC/DC or the Ramones to be music to headbang to because it was just hard rock and punk, respectively.  It should be noted that metal comes in more flavors than anyone knows how to classify, but the primary ones are the American model (Static-X, Rammstein), the Scandinavian model (Hammerfall, Nightwish), and the experimental sort (Finntroll, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum).In conclusion, they recommended that public health agencies issue headbanging warnings on headbanging-worthy CDs, issue neck braces to limit the range of neck motion, and advise that metal bands have tutorials before their concerts.  This leads readers of the paper to conclude that the authors themselves have absolutely no metal cred, because everyone knows that the only way they&amp;#39;ll ever get concert-goers to wear neck-braces is if they become a metal fashion statement.*Swing is a musical concept that relates to the delay between upbeats and downbeats.  Upbeats and downbeats refer, respectively, to beats 2+4 and 1+3 in 4/4 metered music.  Much of rock has the space between all upbeats and downbeats even, but in jazz and some hiphop the space between them is staggered to create a &amp;quot;swing feel&amp;quot;.**See ***.***OK, it was because I am and always have been a nerd and didn&amp;#39;t want 1) to damage my brain or 2) lose my glasses.  I knew what brain damage felt like, I was a clumsy kid and had been through a couple concussions--and headbanging felt far too similar to ever be enjoyable.  Can&amp;#39;t help but to feel a tinge of smug right now with science validating me choosing to almost entirely abstain from it.Patton, D., &amp;amp; McIntosh, A. (2008).

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/279986/group/homepage/"&gt;he got a response&lt;/a&gt; from the North Dakota Department of Transportation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a letter dated today to inform Magee that his plate will be issued as requested, Francis Ziegler, NDDOT’s director, said lawyers from the Attorney General’s office told transportation officials that &lt;strong&gt;Magee has a legal right to the plate&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good move on their part — they already allow religion-friendly plates.  If they said no to Magee, no doubt they would have had a lawsuit coming their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Magee for following through with this and getting the plate he wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

Nominations have now opened for this year’s science prize; you have until May 31 to &lt;a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/05/richard-dawkins-to-judge-2nd-annual-3-quarks-daily-prize-in-science.html"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; your favorite science blog post from the last year; then there will be a round of public voting, and a final award bestowed by a celebrity judge.  Last year the science prize was awarded by Steven Pinker; this year it will be Richard Dawkins.  Someday I’m sure they’ll work their way up to having a physicist serve as judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free, of course, to nominate your favorite posts from Cosmic Variance; I’m far too shallow to be reluctant to win awards.  But even better would be to find a really great post at a smaller blog that not as many people know about, and use this contest as a vehicle for bringing more attention to really good writing.  There’s too much good stuff out there, it’s impossible to follow all of it, so it’s always nice to hear about new bloggers doing great things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have the dedication and patience to cultivate a blooming garden this summer (which not all of us do, believe me), then you definitely want to protect your garden from insects and pests. But you also don’t want to contaminate your naturally-grown vegetables with pesticides or chemicals. &lt;a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/home-garden/get-rid-of-the-most-common-vegetable-garden-insect-pests---without-poisoning-your-garden.html"&gt;Planet Green&lt;/a&gt; compiled a helpful list of common garden predators and what you can do to get rid of them – naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Aphids&lt;/strong&gt; are tiny little annoying bugs that suck the juice from leaves and stems of plants – and possibly spreading disease as they do it. Spray your plants down with a hose, and that should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If you see brown spots on your asparagus stalks, or if the stalks are bent, you’re probably hosting &lt;strong&gt;asparagus beetles&lt;/strong&gt;. Wasps love to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/eat/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=eat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt; these beetles, so don’t go on a wasp-killing-spree. And try to handpick the beetles, as well as their larvae and eggs, from the plants. Gross, but necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Who would have thought that those tiny &lt;strong&gt;white butterflies&lt;/strong&gt; that bob in and out of your garden were actually depositing cabbage worm eggs on your leafy vegetables? Check your kale, cabbage, and broccoli for light green larvae. Just pluck them off the plants and drop them in a cup of soapy water. Or cover your crops with &lt;a href="http://www.planetnatural.com/site/floating-row-cover.html"&gt;floating row covers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Colorado potato beetles&lt;/strong&gt; love to chew foliage on your potato plants. These pests are tougher to get rid of, but crop rotation helps a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Despite their name, &lt;strong&gt;corn borers&lt;/strong&gt; can ravage peppers, beans, and potatoes, too. If you see any of these plants falling over, a corn borer has probably eaten through the stem. Bacillus thuringiensis is a great natural insecticide that eliminates corn borers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Cucumber beetles&lt;/strong&gt; nibble on leaves and fruit of the cucumber, and also spread bacterial wilts. The two best methods of control here are handpicking and floating row covers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. If it seems like your tomato seedling has been chopped down by a minuscule lumberjack, &lt;strong&gt;cutworms&lt;/strong&gt; have been playing house in your garden. To ward against them, put a cardboard toilet paper roll around the stem of your tomato plant – the roll will break down in the dirt, or you can compost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Flea beetles&lt;/strong&gt; leave very small holes in plant leaves. Handpicking is your best defense against this garden nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. The leaves on your beans have been chomped away, leaving only the veins. Who’s to blame? The &lt;strong&gt;Mexican beetle&lt;/strong&gt;. Go with floating row covers for this one, along with handpicking, if you can catch them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Slippery, &lt;strong&gt;slimy slugs&lt;/strong&gt; love to feed on lettuce. Just pull these annoying suckers off your plant and put them in some soapy water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. If you see yellow spots and dry brown droppings on the leaves of your squash, you’re witnessing the handiwork of the &lt;strong&gt;squash bug&lt;/strong&gt;. Try picking them off the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Similar to the squash bug, the &lt;strong&gt;squash vine borer &lt;/strong&gt;crawls into the vine of your plant and makes it wither. Cut the vine open right where the problem seems to start, and you’ll find your culprit. Just dig them out, cut off the wilted part of the stem, and bury the end of the vine into the dirt. New roots will form, and your plant will be as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. &lt;strong&gt;Tomato hornworms&lt;/strong&gt; will feast on your tomato plant like there’s no tomorrow. Once you spot them, it may be too late to save your plant. But pick them off anyway and drown them in soapy water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to turn seventeen and have been an atheist for about a year. I grew up with very liberal and easygoing parents, though they did raise me to be a Christian. I have been trying to decide if I should tell them that I do not believe in god for several months. Part of me wants to tell them now, so that I can stop deceiving them, but another part of me wants to wait until after I’m in college. I think my parents would be pretty understanding, and I am probably worried about nothing, however, the negative backlash I received from my peers at school when they found out about it has me hesitating. I don’t want this knowledge to affect my relationship with my parents like it did for several of my classmates at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate things, when I told people at school that I was an atheist, I learned how many people were hiding the same secret. Despite being situated in a small town in the bible belt, I’ve met a number of students who are also nonbelievers, including my best friend. He and I are considering starting an atheist/agnostic/secular humanist organization at our school. If this were to happen, my mom would almost certainly hear of my involvement, as she teaches in the district. I was wondering if you had any advice concerning this predicament. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Louis,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When young people become eager to tell their parents about their atheism, they usually have a variety of motives. Often part of it is from respect, wanting to be honest and genuine with their parents.  Sometimes it is partly about self-expression, wanting to simply get it off their chests.  Occasionally it is in part an attempt to gain some control in their lives, such as no longer having to attend religious services. Once in a while it is partly motivated by a desire to assert their independence from their parents, to plant a flag in effect and say,  “I am my own person, not an extension of my parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these motives are completely understandable. They are a normal part the process of maturing into adulthood, and they can all be in the mix in differing amounts. Combined, they can create such a burning urgency to come out that some young atheists don’t stop to consider &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the consequences. They usually weigh the possible consequences to &lt;em&gt;themselves,&lt;/em&gt; such as repercussions from the parents, the loss of friends, and the shunning or persecution by others, and they may decide to take the risk anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But innocent people can be affected too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their eagerness to get it out, sometimes young atheists don’t stop to consider the effect that coming out will have on others who will be affected collaterally.  For instance, younger siblings may have to face increased scrutiny and grilling by their parents who will be far more suspicious and reactionary, trying to prevent them from becoming another atheist like their wayward elder sibling. Friends who may be fine with the atheist’s lack of belief can be harassed by other friends who disapprove of their friendship with the atheist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in your case, your mom teaches in the district. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bible belt small towns, there is very little privacy, and there is a great deal of judging of others.  Parents can be harshly judged by others because of  the conduct of their children.  It is usually very unfair, but it is common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you have discovered, atheism is seen by some as an evil thing. If you decided to start an atheist group at your present school, you might be willing to face the mistreatment that you’d get from some Christians who are bigots, but you might not be comfortable seeing your mom get mistreatment from her fellow teachers and even her principal, and perhaps from the larger community.  She might face pressure to “do something” about her atheist son, since she’s his mother. To make matters worse, he’s an &lt;em&gt;activist&lt;/em&gt; atheist who has started a group of &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; at his high school. If his mother simply accepts him as he is, people may wonder what does that imply about her own faith,  and if &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; faith is questionable, what kind of influence is she having on the children she is teaching? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can grow like a snowball of paranoia through guilt by association. The smallness of small town minds can be dismaying, and the social and emotional blackmail can be appalling.  Things could become very difficult for your mom.  Harm to ourselves we might shrug off, but risking harm to our loved ones can make us think twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to completely discourage you from starting a secular students group at your high school; it sounds like it is sorely needed. If no one else was in harm’s way, and if you were willing to take the heat, then I’d say go for it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is for you to consider ahead of time the effect your actions might have on your family not because of their own intolerance, but because of what adversity they might have to face from others.  These possible consequences may not be enough of a reason to hold back &lt;em&gt;in your case,&lt;/em&gt; but it would seem only fair to talk it over with them first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only you can know when and if you should tell your parents about being an atheist, and you’ll be making an educated guess at best. As you are considering, many young people find that waiting for the increased independence that comes with college makes it easier to be open about this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you’ve already revealed to school peers that you’re an atheist. You found several fellow non-believers including your best friend, and you found a few foes.  In a small town, word may spread until it reaches your parents, so if you want to tell them in a controlled manner, you should be rehearsed and prepared to do it at a moment’s notice if they hear rumors.  If you have such information on a Facebook page, consider removing it until you have talked with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are important differences, there are some useful parallels between the gay and lesbian community’s struggle for social acceptance and that of atheists. It’s not a perfect indicator, but if you know how your parents feel about the issue of homosexuality, you might have some insight about how they would react to your atheism. Have some light, casual discussions about current events, politics or religion in general terms, and try to get a sense of their attitude toward people who are different from the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be that your initial thought about your parents is correct, and that they will be understanding and accepting. Or they might be upset at first, but in time they will realize that you are not an ogre, you are still the intelligent, loving and loyal son they have raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your grades up, stay away from drugs and alcohol, (you need every single brain cell) and be a diligent participant in your family’s welfare. That way, nothing negative can be attributed to your atheism, or used to discredit your validity as an independently thinking young adult.  Also, those good habits will help you develop into a healthy and positive person, whether you’re an “out” atheist or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you the very best of outcomes for both you and your family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an an artist's CV, you'll read what museums own pieces of their work and what galleries have shown their exhibitions. A field archaeologist keeps no such list, but we sure keep track in our heads of when our finds get exhibited. Because to any scholar who wants to communicate with the public, it is a source of pride to have uncovered something that people are actually interested in. Most archaeological finds are of course unexhibitable drab fragments, but we love them anyway for their scientific potential. Still, every now and then something pops up that you know is going to be able to speak directly to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/05/skamby_gaming_pieces_on_displa.php"&gt;Skamby gaming pieces&lt;/a&gt; are shown in the County Museum in Linköping, placed on a reconstructed gaming board. Under the pieces are little holes that allows fibre-optic wires to light each chunk of amber from below. They glowed like embers when I was there a few weeks ago, and I was very proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier tonight I had the pleasure of taking part in opening night for &lt;a href="http://www.historiska.se/utstallningar/Kommande-utstallningar/Sveriges-historia/"&gt;the new exhibition on Swedish history&lt;/a&gt; in the Museum of National Antiquities. Meeting colleagues, making new acquaintances and mingling with celebs was very nice. And so was being guided through the exhibition by my friend Linda Wåhlander (though she had to lead us through all ten rooms in only 20 minutes.) But best of all was seeing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/10/djurhamn_sword_excavated.php"&gt;the Djurhamn sword&lt;/a&gt; exhibited in the 16th century room alongside a full-figure portrait of Mad King Eric XIV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For at least the next five years I've got a find in a major exhibition in the country's main archaeological museum, an institution that I consider to be my alma mater. Happy digger! All &lt;i&gt;Aard&lt;/i&gt; readers are encouraged to check out the exhibition if you find yourselves in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wakefield is not going away, but if yesterday’s anti-vaccine rally in Chicago is any indication, his audience is growing smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 100 anti-vaccine activists turned out to hear Wakers and nine other speakers on a sunny day in Grant Park. If you add event volunteers, vendors, press, speakers, &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, and curious bystanders, the crowd numbered less than 200.  As Kevin at LBRB says, it was &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/the-american-rally-for-personal-rights-bit-of-a-damp-squib/"&gt;a bit of a damp squib&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any good public speaker, Wakefield s&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/12079650"&gt;tarted off with a story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;About 15 years ago a mother from London approached him and said “Do not judge me too harshly Dr.  Wakefield, but when I die I am taking my son with me. You see, I’m all  he has. I’m the only one who loves him.”
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t judge,” said  Wakefield. “I was moved by the love that a mother must have for her  child that she would take his life rather than have him fall upon a  society that really didn’t give a damn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/12079650"&gt;Here’s the video.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established street cred, Wakefield went on to assure his fans that vaccines are way more dangerous that the diseases they protect us against, and they are not being adequately studied for safety. So Wakefield, disgraced and defrocked medical doctor and spiritual guru to American’s floundering anti-vaccine movement, will soldier on, and continue to do the studies that the medical establishment is afraid of. Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd also heard from financial analyst and amateur immunologist Michael Belkin, who played electric guitar and sang &lt;em&gt;Vaccine Gestapo&lt;/em&gt;. He was introduced by a speaker who claimed “vaccine safety” is the defining issue of our day – forget global warming, social inequality, radical Islam, and the season finale of &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;. The real tragedy is that too many children are protected against too many diseases. Fortunately we have a talented songwriter to whip the masses into a frenzy. Lucky audience members snagged free copies of Belkin’s CD, which featured two other ditties: &lt;em&gt;We Don’t Want Their Flu Vaccine&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Keep Your Mandates Out of My Body&lt;/em&gt;. Here’s the cover art:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Refusers1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Refusers1" src="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Refusers1-300x290.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="290"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine trial lawyers hit some low notes of their own. Attorney Robert Krakow, who draws his sustenance from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, pretended to lead anti-vaccine activists in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4xD8j8ye9k"&gt;The Fish Cheer&lt;/a&gt;. He stopped at F, and quipped “That’s what the government can do with its vaccine program.” Referring to his salad days of prosecuting drug crimes in Manhattan, Krakow confessed “I should have been going after the real drug pushers” – meaning the CDC, AAP, FDA, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to Attorney Krakow: Technically speaking, vaccines are not drugs, they’re “biologics”. But we get it – you’re mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a time, Wakefield stuck close by Attorney Jim Moody, another vaccine-court regular, not surprising given that so many of the ethical charges against Wakefield stemmed from his cozy relationships with trial lawyers.  Here’s Wakefield and Moody catching some rays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rally organizers clearly expected much larger crowds, as evidenced by dozens of anti-vaccine signs still unused by 5 pm, when the park started to clear out. A sign-in sheet listed about 35 names and email addresses. Hundreds of free bananas remained unclaimed, and most of the vendors’ tables that lined one side of the quad remained empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of city carried on as normal. In this case, that was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

As a consequence of their food choices, vegetarians and vegans are often accused of and taunted for loving animals more than people. But do most vegetarians care less for fellow humans than animals, care for humans and animals equally, or care more for humans than animals but still care more for animals than omnivores do?A study published yesterday in PLoS ONE has attempted to parse out differences among omnivores, vegetarians and vegans in brain responses to human and animal suffering. The three groups were first given the Empathy quotient questionnaire, and it was determined that vegans and vegetarians scored significantly higher in empathy than omnivores. Next, the subjects had their brains scanned with fMRI as they viewed images of human suffering, animal suffering and “neutral” natural landscapes. Many differences were found among the brains of those with different feedings habits.Firstly, vegetarians and vegans had higher engagement than omnivores of “empathy related areas,” such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while observing both human and animal suffering. This seems to suggest that there is a neural basis for those with meatless lifestyles having greater empathy for all living beings.However, when viewing animal suffering but not human suffering, meat-free subjects recruited additional empathy related areas in prefrontal and visual areas and reduced their right amygdala activity. This may be interpreted as evidence that vegetarians and vegans care more about the emotions of animals than those of humans. It is important to consider how the study was conducted, though, before reaching such a conclusion.The authors themselves note a couple of weaknesses in their design. The subjects’ brain activities while they viewed human or animal suffering were compared to the baseline/control condition of “neutral” scenes that did not include living beings, faces, or suffering of any kind, which are all factors that should have been considered. The subjects were also simply asked to look at the images of the different conditions without being asked about their thoughts or feelings, so it is impossible to confidently attribute their brain responses to specific emotions. But even if the demonstrated brain activity represented empathy, there is also the possibility that the subjects were desensitized to images of human suffering that appear daily on the news. Desensitization to an image does not necessarily reflect empathetic feelings toward fellow humans. So a claim that vegetarians/vegans love animals more than humans because they have more empathetic neural activity while viewing suffering animals than suffering humans is unsubstantiated at this point.Another major finding in this study was differences in neural representations of cognitive empathy between vegetarians and vegans. All of these subjects had chosen not to eat meat for ethical reasons, but the authors suggest that these differences in vegan and vegetarian brain responses indicate that the groups experience empathy for suffering differently, possibly due to differences in reasons for their diet choices. Again, these results should be taken as preliminary because of weaknesses in the study’s design.Overall the study is interesting, but it remains to be seen whether this will spark further research that will ultimately demonstrate findings significant enough to affect public policy and animal cruelty regulations. For now, we have a bit of a clearer picture of the brain’s representation of empathy and a lot of extra material for the never-ending ethical debate over man’s right to meat.Filippi M, Riccitelli G, Falini A, Di Salle F, Vuilleumier P, Comi G, &amp;amp; Rocca MA (2010).

Despite the fact that further lesion based evidence severely weakened the relationship (e.g., Broca&amp;#39;s aphasics are pretty good at grammaticality judgments) subsequent PET and fMRI studies prolonged the marriage by showing that the comprehension of complex sentences activates Broca&amp;#39;s area more than simple sentences.  These days a look at the literature on Broca&amp;#39;s area and sentence processing is full of controversy with proposals ranging from the region supporting syntactic movement processing (Grodzinsky) hierarchical structure and phrase structure building (Friederici), &amp;quot;linearization&amp;quot; (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky), and several more domain-general functions such as cognitive control (Novick), &amp;quot;unification&amp;quot; (Hagoort) and working memory (Caplan; Rogalsky/Hickok).  Meanwhile, evidence has been accumulating that the anterior temporal lobe may house a network that behaves much more like a syntactic computation system in that it seems to be highly correlated with the presence or absence of syntactic information in a sentence (Dronkers, et al. 2004; Friederici, et al., 2000; Humphries, et al. 2005,2006; Mazoyer et al., 1993; Rogalsky &amp;amp; Hickok, 2008; Stowe et al., 1998; Vandenberghe, Nobre, &amp;amp; Price, 2002).A new study in Brain and Language weighs in on the issue using the psycholinguists&amp;#39; favorite work of literature, Alice in Wonderland.  Unlike most psycholinguistic nods to Lewis Carroll (a.k.a. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), the study by Jonathan Brennan and colleagues did not use Jabberwocky sentences, but instead had subjects listen to text from Alice while chillin&amp;#39; in a giant magnetic donut.  The authors calculated word-by-word the amount of syntactic structure that was involved in integrating each word (basically a syntactic tree node counting analysis).  These values were then correlated with the fMRI signal.  So what brain region correlated with syntactic structure?  You guessed it: the anterior temporal lobe.

&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis may sound like something you’ll worry about in your twilight years, but it’s actually an auto-immune disease that’s becoming more and more common in women. It usually affects women between 40-60 years old, and causes joints and their surrounding tissue to become inflamed, leading to pain, stiffness, and a variety of not-fun side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, the number of cases of rheumatoid arthritis had been falling for 40 years, but between 1995 and 2007 they increased by 2.5%. However, in the same time period, cases have fallen among men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are three times more likely than men to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Since rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune disorder, there isn’t much rhyme or reason as to why people get it, but some research has linked smoking and vitamin D deficiency to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis patients are coping better than ever thanks to early detection and biological therapies, but it’s still a painful, life-changing condition. Time to put out the cigarettes and make sure your daily multivitamin contains a hefty dose of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/"&gt;TAM London 2010&lt;/a&gt; will be October 16 – 17 in (duh) London. The speakers list is every bit as impressive as last year’s! The highlight, no doubt, will be the premier of Tim Minchin’s animated short film &amp;quot;Storm&amp;quot;, which is destined to become a skeptical classic — &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9bT73BM2Ic"&gt;watch the trailer here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/tamlondon2010.jpg" alt="tamlondon2010" title="tamlondon2010" width="612" height="213"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you ask, I won’t be at TAM London this year; the point is to make it Eurocentric, so American speakers are kept to a minimum. But of course, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/tam-8-registration.html"&gt;TAM 8 will be in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; this year from July 8 – 11. I’ll very much be there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The &lt;a href="http://www.szkeptikus.hu/14th-european-skeptic-congress?Itemid=78"&gt;14th annual European Skeptics Conference&lt;/a&gt; will be from September 17 – 19 in Budapest, Hungary. That’s run by &lt;a href="http://www.ecso.org/component/jcalpro/cat/cat_id/2"&gt;the European Council of Skeptical Organisations&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve heard Budapest is lovely, and someday I hope to get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never been to a critical thinking conference, then you really should attend. And if you want to go to TAM, you’d better be ready to buy tickets when they become available; last year they sold out &lt;em&gt;in less than an hour&lt;/em&gt;. There was a reason for that: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/21/tam-london-video-3-brian-cox/"&gt;it was awesome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

So I thought I’d base today’s Inquisition on some of the gender dynamics behind body image perceptions and the peripheral issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/stellamagazine/7725736/Women-and-body-image-a-mans-perspective.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from Sunday’s &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; basically tries to answer the question: “How can a man look at an ad featuring a male model with six-pack abs and laugh, while a woman might look at a photograph of female perfection and fall to pieces?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this premise is based on generalities. Where the cultural conditioning angle the article takes appears to be in line with what we observe, many supporting points seem to rely on “social hearsay”, and the gender differences are explained with some sketchy aspects of psychological evolution. Nevertheless, there is some measure of accuracy in the article’s description of those differences. Many of the readers here (gay and hetero) have no doubt experienced something at least similar to the pre-party meltdown, where the partner looks perfectly fine, but due to some perceived inadequacy/flaw/short-coming refuses to go to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is: “Why does that happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since the A.I. is all about you. Let’s dig into &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; experiences and psyche to reveal the answers . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever have a crisis of confidence about the way you look? If so, what do you do about it? Does it happen often? Is there any pattern to it? What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think causes/caused it? Can you rationalize it? Is there a way to make your partner/family/friends understand what you’re going through?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 3pm ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274988920405"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=8709">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebeba5dfc7bc60b4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Conservatives and Science"/><category term="Environment"/><category term="Global Warming"/><category term="cuccinelli"/><category term="mann"/><category term="university of virginia"/><title type="html">UVA Fights Back Against Cuccinelli</title><published>2010-05-27T19:35:12Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T19:35:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/05/27/uva-fights-back-against-cuccinelli/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">While I don't have anything to link to yet, I've learned that the University of Virginia has responded in court to Ken Cuccinelli's abusive legal move, opposing his discovery attempt on academic freedom grounds.

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Susan G. Komen fought breast cancer with her heart, body, and      soul. Throughout her diagnosis, treatments, and endless days in the      hospital, she spent her time thinking of ways to make life better for      other women battling breast cancer instead of worrying about her own      situation. That concern for others continued even as Susan neared the      end of her fight. Moved by Susan’s compassion for others and  committed     to making a difference, Nancy G. Brinker promised her  sister that  she    would do everything in her power to end breast  cancer forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That promise is now Susan G. Komen for the Cure®, the global      leader of the breast cancer movement, having invested nearly $1.5      billion since its inception in 1982. As the world’s largest grassroots      network of breast cancer survivors and activists, we’re working    together   to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all,    and   energize science to find the cures. Thanks to events like the    Susan G.   Komen Race for the Cure®, and generous contributions from our    partners,   sponsors, and fellow supporters, we have become the   largest  source of   nonprofit funds dedicated to the fight against   breast  cancer in the   world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But in truth, the event took longer than many today believe, and many of the specific details, the exact order of events, the actual meaning of each detail, are not fully understood.  Indeed, in the process of describing this event today, we find considerable disagreement, or at least, it is clear that one person's version is different than another's.  I'd be happy to give you my version of it.  What qualifies me to do that?  Well, for one thing, I was there when it happened...

The mind can perform mental time travel - it occasionally strays from the present moment, to recollect an experience from the near or distant past, or to imagine an event that has not yet taken place. We know that imagining a future event is dependant on memory, because patients with amnesia cannot imagine new experiences. It involves piecing together fragments of past experiences to generate a plausible simulation of what might happen. This may have been an important development in human evolution, as it enables us anticipate a likely outcome and to plan the best possible course of action. 

Space and time are intimately linked in the mind, and this is reflected in our metaphors. We often say that we are thinking back to a past event, or looking forward to one that will take place in the future. But the mind and body are also closely linked: think about a past experience, and you might find yourself moving backwards. A new study suggests that this can be reversed, by showing that apparent motion can influence the direction of the mind&amp;#39;s wanderings. Thus, moving backwards could evoke long lost memories, while moving forward might make you think about the future.

We compulsively examine, study, appraise, size up, and scope out what those around us are doing and then gossip with others about what we&amp;#39;ve seen or heard.  New ideas or behaviors are especially compelling and will often have cultural critics discussing them at length, whether they&amp;#39;re tribal elders or the United States Congress.  

Given this equal opportunity scrutiny, why is it then that only some individuals and not others become cultural innovators, serving as models for our own behavior?  For example, when Benjamin Franklin adorned his rustic fur cap in France or when Tupac Shakur wore his baggy jeans on stage, they inspired widespread cultural trends that made their mark on history (by contrast, notice how few people copied Henry David Thoreau&amp;#39;s fetching neckbeard or the, let&amp;#39;s call it unique, style of Vanilla Ice).  In societies around the globe certain influential figures, to use the concept of anthropologist and philosopher Pierre Bourdieu, benefit from &amp;quot;cultural capital&amp;quot; because of their social prestige in a given society.  This results in others being more likely to adopt any unique cultural traits that they invent.  After all, if someone who is widely admired and successful adopts a new way of doing things, perhaps following their lead could make you admired and successful too?

Now, a new study in PLoS ONE by Victoria Horner, Darby Proctor, Kristin E. Bonnie, Andrew Whiten, and Frans de Waal suggests that prestige is an important factor in other primates as well.  By employing a simple behavioral experiment these researchers demonstrated that chimpanzees, when given a choice between two nearly identical tasks, will choose the one they previously witnessed a high-ranking member of the troop perform.

In 2006 paleoanthropologists working in Ethiopia made a spectacular announcement - they had found the well-preserved remains of a juvenile Australopithecus afarensis, one of our prehistoric hominin relatives. Quickly dubbed "Lucy's baby" this 3.4 million year old specimen graced the cover of Nature and numerous news reports, yet its description represents only a fraction of the paleontological work being done in the area. Many other fossil animals have been found along the banks of the Awash, too, and in the latest issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology scientists Denis Geraads, Zeresenay Alemseged, René Bobe, Denné Reed have described a previously unknown species of dog which would have lived alongside the australopithecines.

(So we don’t fry this Memorial Day Weekend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Skin &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S., but it’s also one of the easiest to prevent. The main cause of skin cancer is overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, whether from the sun or artificial lights, like the UV lamps in tanning beds. If that’s not enough to make you slather on sunscreen, check out this eye-opener: According to the EPA, more new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year than new cases of &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/breast/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=breast&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt;, prostate, lung and colon cancers combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The EPA is promoting &lt;a href="http://www.skincancerprevention.org/Events/DontFryDay/tabid/113/Default.aspx"&gt;“Don’t Fry Day”&lt;/a&gt; to school children around the country through its SunWise program. Students are learning how to Slip, Slop, Slap® …and Wrap – slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen, slap on a wide-brimmed hat, and wrap on sunglasses. While you may be past the point of tongue-twisters, it’s a good reminder of how to prevent skin cancer while having a great holiday weekend.

It showed that he could tell family was important to me; it also indicated that he wanted to stick around to meet mine. It proved that our date was different from the many I had had before. Good thing I have this beautiful memory to hold on to, because I don’t think he’s paid attention to a word I’ve said since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been together for seven months now, and things are going great. But to G., verbal communication isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Granted, when you spend a lot of time with someone, you say many inconsequential things just to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/exercise/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=exercise&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; your jaw when you’re not using it to chew, but still. Here’s a simplified example of what happens on a typical evening on my couch. G. and I will be watching “24” and I’ll say: “It looks like Chloe lost ten pounds between hours seven and eight.” Three minutes later, G. will remark: “Does Chloe seem skinnier to you?” Some play on this happens just about every night; I’ll mention a trivial thing I noticed, and he’ll point out the very same thing moments after I’ve said it. Come to think of it, maybe he is listening, it’s just that whatever I say goes directly to his subconscious with no pit stop at his conscious. Whatever it is, it proves what we already know – men don’t listen, at least not the way we do. But I don’t take it personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can remember where the Dow closed last Wednesday, the value of the Euro, and all kinds of baseball stats, but they will never memorize your bra size – so forget about a gift from Agent Provocateur without any prompting from you. Movies are my boyfriend’s passion. He’ll see a listing for a film by a director six people have heard of and the date, time, and place of the screening will penetrate his head indelibly. If I tell him I made us a dinner reservation at my favorite restaurant for some special occasion, he’ll ask me three or four times where we’re going to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/topic/eat/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=eat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we somehow manage to communicate. By listening to (and this is an optimistic estimate) 70% of my proclamations, G. seems to understand what is important to me. His actions speak louder than even my loudest, unheeded word. He may not remember the name of the restaurant, but he’s there across from me feigning interest in the news of my day. And there are some upsides to being ignored. If G. gets angry at me for writing this post, I can just say I told him about it. He’ll have to believe me.&lt;/p&gt;

You know the type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He probably does more for the cause of atheism than Christianity, though… it helps that he brings out our creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point, a few months ago, when he was at the University of Arizona with his partner-in-crime &lt;strong&gt;Sister Cindy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/02/22/how-to-make-the-most-of-a-campus-preacher/"&gt;this was the response&lt;/a&gt; from the school’s &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=85555430005"&gt;Secular Student Alliance affiliate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/brojeduofa2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/brojeduofa2.jpg" alt="" title="brojeduofa2" width="558" height="453"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Jed’s recent solo appearance at the University of Oregon, the members of the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=66447791292"&gt;Alliance of Happy Atheists&lt;/a&gt; took a slightly different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Day One of Jed’s two-day preach-a-thon, members of the group stood right behind him holding atheist-friendly signs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_0412-550x412.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_0412" width="550" height="412"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those signs read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is Power”&lt;br&gt;
“Trust Yourself”&lt;br&gt;
“Atheists ♥ You”&lt;br&gt;
“Don’t believe in god? You’re not alone”&lt;br&gt;
“AHA!: A Community of Atheists”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=394706748268"&gt;According to Jed&lt;/a&gt;, they “were not particularly vocal or argumentative” but they clearly had an effect on him, judging by his thrilled reaction in the image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Second Day, the group members one-upped themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one of their meetings earlier this school year, attendees were given a task by AHA board members &lt;strong&gt;Shireen Noroozi&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shannon McCormick&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;They had to create their own religion, complete with a unique mythology, a deity to worship, prayers to say, etc&lt;/em&gt;.  To help facilitate this, the leaders gave each group a random household object to base their new religion around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greg Gant&lt;/strong&gt;’s group received a boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it played out, in Greg’s own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When it came time to explain to the larger group what our religion was about, &lt;strong&gt;Tony Dundon&lt;/strong&gt; wanted to preach (in a passionate faux southern Baptist manner) about “The Boot.” So when it came to our turn to present, we let Tony go for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony was quite hysterical as a southern Baptist minister, and exceptionally clever, responding to questions on the fly. Someone would shout a question like, “What about Uggs?” and Tony would rant about the deception of the false boots that were unable to protect one’s feet from the wetness, and that the truth path was only found in the footwear that was capable of keeping your feet dry.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, he had the audience cracking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when Brother Jed made his appearance, Tony set up shop right next to him and began preaching about The Boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/boot-15-CRW_5379-550x366.jpg" alt="" title="Boot1" width="550" height="366"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would get more followers, Tony or Jed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony, of course &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Boot2-550x366.jpg" alt="" title="Boot2" width="550" height="366"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Tony preached the way of the boot, and its great protection against the evil wetness. It was very clear that Tony was drawing an audience, as students passing by stopped to witness Tony preach, and Jed drew only glances. Those remembered Jed, offered praise to Tony, there were more than a handful of students who laughed and offered support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… some non-members played along asking Tony questions about the ways of the Boot. One person shouted, “How do you start on the path of the boot?” and Tony retorted, “You start one foot at time!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Jed realized he couldn’t compete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Boot3-550x366.jpg" alt="" title="Boot3" width="550" height="366"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Boot4-550x274.jpg" alt="" title="Boot4" width="550" height="274"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg mentioned that the only thing Brother Jed managed to say to Tony this whole time was a hearty, “You’re all going to hell!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing to make this even better is hearing about the experience from Brother Jed’s perspective, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=505758916"&gt;courtesy of his Facebook note&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At 1:50 a dozen or so atheists gathered close to where I was preaching. Their leader held up an old rubber boot and mockingly encouraged his fellow infidels to worship the boot. These God haters would respond by saying, “Amen.” &lt;strong&gt;After about 10 minutes of this distraction I stopped preaching since I did not have an audience.&lt;/strong&gt; The boot preacher went on and on blaspheming salvation, church, prayer, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will get the last laugh…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  Boots really *do* have magical powers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful way to counter Jed: Combatting his hatred with hilarity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It got picked up everywhere, to my surprise. I mean, seriously, I have to confess that I whipped that out in 20 minutes, no edits or rewrites, just shazam, it's done. I'm really peeved at myself for anguishing over this book I'm working on, because apparently, all I've got to do is get a big glass of root beer, pop some bubblegum in my mouth, put something bubbly and light on the stereo, and once I enter a zen trance, the book will be done tomorrow. I'm going to try that right after this.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another apologist is quoting it now. One of the most amusing consequences of its popularity is that so many theists get it completely wrong: they see the Courtier's Reply as an attempt to excuse atheists from bothering with theology at all, when it's quite the opposite: it's a rebuke to theologians, pointing out that going on at length about rarefied epiphenomena and delicate points of dogma is a waste of time when you haven't even established the central point of the matter, a reasonable justification for believing in a god or gods, period. I'll give credit to &lt;a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/atheologies/2688/can_atheists_simply_ignore_theology"&gt;Eric Reitan for seeing that point, dimly&lt;/a&gt;, although he ultimately decides that it's all about avoiding intellectual responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, but he's picked the wrong target. It's not the atheists who are shirking that responsibility, it's the blind theologians who spin elaborate fables out of air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Reitan does in his essay is an interesting sidestep. He acknowledges that there are two kinds of theologies — &amp;quot;apologetic theology&amp;quot;, which attempts to address the reality of god&amp;#39;s existence, and the misleadingly named &amp;quot;substantive theology&amp;quot;, which he claims is about the operational consequences once we&amp;#39;ve assumed god&amp;#39;s existence — and he simply waves away apologetic theology for now. He still &lt;i&gt;claims&lt;/i&gt; there&amp;#39;s good reason to believe, but it&amp;#39;s not the topic here — it&amp;#39;s exclusively about whether we can dismiss &amp;quot;substantive theology&amp;quot;, which is what the Courtier&amp;#39;s Reply argues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His mission, then, should be to justify that word "substantive" and show us exactly how this kind of theology can be useful and worth pursuing, even if the existence of a deity is unverifiable and unevidenced. He fails. He falls into the same waffly, weebly, worthless noise that all the modern excuse-makers do, whether it's Karen Armstrong or the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/grayling-on-the-dalai-lama/"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But belief in God isn't primarily a belief about the contents of the empirical world. It is, rather, a certain holistic interpretation of our experience, one that offers an account of the meaning and significance of the empirical world and the lives we lead within it. To believe in God is to understand the world of ordinary experience in terms of an interpretive worldview that posits the existence of "something more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify that for you, Dr Reitan. You are saying that religion is a nice fairy tale that makes you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not enough for me. I stand with millions of unbelievers everywhere who demand something a little more, who expect that the ideas that we will use to guide our lives will also be true. Theologians seem to have decided that truth is optional and irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That abandonment of the truth is the heart of his argument, and he goes on at some length to justify parity between supernatural and natural worldviews. He tries to claim that theology is just like naturalism, equally unjustifiable and ultimately arbitrary, and simply a matter of convenience and compatibility with our personal philosophies. We have to "try on" different philosophies about the universe in order to determine which one fits, as if the universe is a rack of clothes with different sizes for different folks, and we have to each pick and choose to determine which universe is best for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we even begin to answer such a question without seriously "trying on" the alternatives? In its broadest terms, theology is the intellectual project of developing and exploring a range of alternative worldviews that all have something in common--namely, they include belief in a transcendent reality that is in some way both fundamental and good. As such, theology falls within a much broader intellectual project, one that develops and explores not only theistic worldviews, but other worldviews as well, such as the naturalistic one endorsed by Dawkins, Myers, and Sanderson.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course, an interpretive worldview has to fit with our experience, including what science teaches us about the world. And not every theistic worldview meets this criterion (Young Earth Creationism comes to mind). But while a specific formulation of theism might have to give way before scientific evidence in just the way that a specific version of Darwinian theory might need to give way to a more nuanced and comprehensive version, the overall theological project--to shape a theistic worldview consistent with experience--remains viable regardless of what science teaches us. What this means is that in a broad sense a theistic worldview is empirically unfalsifiable…just like a naturalistic one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stark raving naked bullshit. This is what you get when you try to pretend that reality is a "worldview".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views of theologians are obviously unfalsifiable — they&amp;#39;ve been tedious exercises in futility for millennia, always going in circles and spitting out ever more bizarre and arcane dogmas that lead to a constant splintering of interpretations. The big difference between science and religion here is that science is a tool focused on &lt;i&gt;assessing&lt;/i&gt; the validity of its propositions. Religion has absolutely no way to test any of its ideas, and its proponents seem to like it that way — it gives them free rein to promote imagination over evidence and revelation over experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, tell me, Dr Reitan: are theologians working on a grand project to reconcile Christianity and Islam? Even Protestantism vs. Catholicism? Is that too much, should we narrow our goals to resolving smaller sectarian differences, like the Wisconsin vs. Missouri synods of the Lutheran church? Which particular sect has the worldview most consistent with experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reitan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;substantive theology&amp;quot; seems to be particularly unsubstantive — it relies entirely on &lt;i&gt;avoiding&lt;/i&gt; any kind of grounding in reality in order to excuse this idea that an objective, unyielding external reality is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we must struggle to assess the relative merits of the alternatives available to us--something that we simply cannot responsibly do by ignoring those thinkers who, as part of a rich traditional of rigorous inquiry, attempt to construct plausible theistic world views and uncover the explanatory power of theism in relation to the full breadth of our human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there's the problem: constructing "plausible theistic world views". How does one determine that a particular theistic world view is plausible? Are virgin births and resurrecting rabbis plausible, while dwarfs forging magic rings or galactic overlords throwing criminals into volcanoes are implausible? They only seem plausible if you uncritically except the "apologetic theology" of a Jehovah or Niflheim or Xenu, and Reitan is right back to his original attempt to separate these into two different domains of theology. One cannot exist without the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he misses the other failure of theology. Scientists construct "plausible world views" all the time: we call them hypotheses. The difference is that we then commit ourselves to trying to &lt;i&gt;disprove&lt;/i&gt; our hypotheses, and we revise them as we test them. Reitan wrote his little essay in reply to a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/26/theology-atheism"&gt;piece by Terry Sanderson&lt;/a&gt;, and unsurprisingly completely neglects this telling and relevant point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at it this way. If science disappeared from human memory, we would soon be living in caves again. If theology disappeared from human memory, no one would notice. Theology is a completely and utterly useless pursuit. It is self-indulgence of the first order. It grieves me that public money is spent on theological colleges while real education struggles to gain the funds it needs to maintain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science provides tangible evidence of its accuracy and importance. Religion makes excuses for its absence of the same. There is no "rich tradition of rigorous inquiry" in religion, as we can see from its lack of progress, and the apologists are deluding themselves when they claim there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want intellectual irresponsibility? Turn to the fools who build elaborate claims of fashionable nonsense. Reitan does understand what I was saying with the Courtier's Reply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myers' satire has as its backdrop a story in which a pair of con men have pretended to make a new set of clothes for the emperor but present him instead with nothing but thin air, along with a cockamamie story to the effect that those who are stupid or unfit for their positions can't see these fine clothes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exactly&lt;/i&gt;. When the worldview fits, wear it, Eric Reitan.&lt;/p&gt;

We tested your &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/nutrition/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=nutrition&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt; smarts yesterday by asking which snack was healthier: A whole-grain scone or apple slices with cheese? If you thought apple, you thought right! According to &lt;em&gt;Our Bodies, Ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, apple slices and cheese are a perfect snack. Apples contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and cheese adds protein and fat for a great nutritional balance. It’ll stabilize your blood sugar and provide the nutrients and energy you need to push through your afternoon slump. A whole-grain scone, on the other hand, contains a lot of sugar, not many vitamins or protein, and many are made with hydrogenated fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stop and think about it, you use a lot of electronics everyday. Your computer, your phone – even your garage door opener. Did you ever think about how green those electronics are? &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; just released their quarterly &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/"&gt;Guide to Greener Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, which ranks companies by the environmental impact of their products. Want to know who you should buy your next phone from? Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Nokia&lt;/strong&gt;. The Japanese manufacturer held its spot as number one from last quarter’s guide. The company does not use brominated compounds, chlorinated flame retardants, and antimony trioxide – all harmful to to the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/environment/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=environment&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt; and humans – in any of its new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sony Ericcson.&lt;/strong&gt; Sony comes in second for wins points for skipping use of PVC or brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which can be harmful to people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… And who not to buy from? Toshiba’s ranking took a nose dive from third place to 14th because they failed on their promise to make all new consumer products PVC and BFR-free by Aprils 1. Nintendo came in dead last, again, and they don’t seem to have any plans to become greener in the near future. Dell, who jumped four places since the last issue, came in 10th place. Dell is still producing electronics that contain PVC and BFRs, which they said they would stop by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does a company’s eco-friendly ranking affect how likely you are to buy their products? Let us know in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

Have a coin handy? Flip it. 

If your coin is fair, I can guess that it&amp;#39;s come up heads and have a fifty percent chance, or probability equal to 0.5, that I&amp;#39;ve guessed correctly. Now, flip the coin ten times in a row. How many times did heads come up? Again, the best guess is that it came up five times—but it&amp;#39;s not all that unlikely that it came up six times, or four, or even as many as eight.

Photo by jcotherals.Now, if you flipped the coin an infinite number of times, then exactly fifty percent of the total flips would be heads. But who has time for that? Similarly, populations of living organisms are not infinite—often far from it—and this means that the frequency of genes in those finite populations can change as a result of the same phenomenon at work on your coin. Biologists call this genetic drift. 

Evolution at random

The basic principle behind genetic drift is that each generation is a process of sampling from the parental population to create a population of offspring. As most folks know from discussions of opinion polls, smaller samples tend to be less representative of the pool from which they are drawn. Say a population of annual plants begins with equal numbers of plants bearing blue flowers or white flowers. If only ten seeds survive from that population to form the next generation, you would expect them to be five blue-flowered and five white-flowered seeds. However, it&amp;#39;s just like flipping a coin ten times: the probability of drawing six blue seeds is actually a little less than 21%, or one in five. The probability of drawing nine blue seeds is almost one in one hundred—small, but hardly impossible.

Consider, too, that once you draw six blue seeds, it becomes slightly more likely that you&amp;#39;ll draw seven in the next generation, which makes it slightly more likely you&amp;#39;ll draw eight in the next. Repeated selection of small samples means that traits can drift to fixation (or loss, depending on your perspective), so that everyone in the population has the same trait. Rare traits are more likely to be lost to drift, and large populations are less prone to its effects. This is nicely illustrated in this online simulation from the University of Connecticut—over time, a focal gene fixes or disappears from the population as a function of the population size and the initial frequency of the gene. 

In general, drift interferes with the efficient operation of natural selection. Even in relatively large populations, the probability that a new beneficial mutation will become fixed is approximately twice the selective benefit of that mutation—typically very small. (This is from a 1927 paper by J.B.S. Haldane that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be online in any form, but which is discussed by Otto and Whitlock in a 1997 paper extending the classic result.) In a small enough population, a trait can become fixed even if it reduces its carriers&amp;#39; fitness [PDF].

Evolving differences without selection

As I&amp;#39;ve discussed above, the effect of drift in a single population is to reduce variation as rare traits are lost to chance. This means that, when more than one independently-evolving population is considered, drift actually increases variation among them [$a], as different traits fix or are lost in each. That is, drift can make isolated populations evolve into different species even if they experience identical regimes of natural selection.

.flickr-photo { }.flickr-framewide { float: right; text-align: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; width:100%;}.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Woodland salamanders (genus Plethodon: left, P. vehiculum; right, P. yonahlossee) have diversified not by adapting to different environments, but by being homebodies. Photos by squamatologist.A flagship example of this sort of non-adaptive diversification are the woodland salamanders of eastern North America, genus Plethodon. Woodland salamanders are quite diverse, having accumulated more than 40 species in the last 27 million years, but all of these species live in more or less the same habitat, under the leaf litter in moist Appalachian forests, and many are &amp;quot;cryptic&amp;quot; species distinguishable only by DNA analysis. How, then, did Plethodon become so diverse? 

The answer is simply that woodland salamanders don&amp;#39;t travel very well. Salamanders need moist environments–they breathe through their skin, which doesn&amp;#39;t work well if it dries out—and so have difficulty moving from one stream drainage to another. This means that it doesn&amp;#39;t take much distance to isolate one Plethodon population from another, allowing drift to take them in different directions. Salamanders form new species, in other words, by staying at home.

This effect of drift means that biologists must adjust their &amp;quot;null&amp;quot; expectation when they observe differences in natural populations—the mere fact that some Joshua trees look different from other Joshua trees does not necessarily mean that natural selection has created those differences. Furthermore, the degree to which drift or selection can generate differences among populations depends strongly on the fourth force in the Big Four, which I&amp;#39;ll discuss next week: migration.

Learning, then, consists of the strengthening of some synapses, the weakening of others, and maybe even the formation of entirely new ones. But a paper from Catherine Miller and colleagues suggests that changes to DNA are also involved: Cortical DNA methylation maintains remote memory.DNA is a series of bases, and fundamentally there are just four: C, A, T and G. However, the Cs and the As can be methylated, i.e. modified by the addition of a very simple methyl chemical group. They then stay that way until they get demethylated in the reverse process. Methylating a gene generally reduces its expression.It&amp;#39;s a bit like writing notes in pencil on top of a printed document: it  doesn&amp;#39;t change the underlying genetic sequence, but it&amp;#39;s a semi-permanent change and it can be inherited by dividing cells. Methylation is a classic example of an epigenetic change, and epigenetics is very hot right now.Miller et al found that learning induces the methylation of a gene called calcineurin (CaN) in the cells of the frontal cortex of rats. These changes appeared within 1 day of the learning event, and they persisted for at least 30 days (the longest time studied - they could well last much longer). Methylation of another gene, reelin, was also increased, but only for a few hours.When they blocked these changes by injecting a DNA methylation inhibitor into the frontal cortex, it caused amnesia - even if the drug was given 30 days after the learning had taken place. In other words, the methylation inhibitors somehow erased the memory traces. These authors have previously reported that the same kind of learning causes a short-lived increase in methylation in the hippocampus. Taken together with these data, this fits with the well-known theory that memory traces start off being stored in the hippocampus and are then somehow transferred to the cortex later.This kind of research has a bit of a history. The idea that memories are stored in DNA has led some to theorize that memories can be inherited. It also reminds me of the work of psychologist and Unabomber-victim James McConnell, who claimed that planarian worms can learn information by eating the ground-up remains of other worms who knew something...These data are very interesting, but they  don&amp;#39;t imply anything quite so exciting. The pattern of methylation seemed entirely random (except in the sense that it was targeted at certain genes) - so rather than encoding information per se, the DNA changes were acting as a way of reducing CaN gene expression. Most likely, the reduction in CaN was limited to certain cells, and these were the cells that formed the connections that encoded the information.Miller, C., Gavin, C., White, J., Parrish, R., Honasoge, A., Yancey, C., Rivera, I., Rubio, M., Rumbaugh, G., &amp;amp; Sweatt, J.

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://www.jeremybyoder.com/" title=""&gt;Jeremy Yoder&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/" title=""&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.denimandtweed.com/" title=""&gt;Denim and Tweed&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions. Jeremy came to ScienceOnline2010 as one of the two winners of the &lt;a href="http://www.nescent.org/index.php" title=""&gt;NESCent&lt;/a&gt; blogging contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jeremy Yoder pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Jeremy%20Yoder%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;Hello, and many thanks for having me! I'm not sure how best to start this, so I'll just go from the beginning: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up very &lt;a href="http://www.mennoniteusa.org"&gt;Mennonite&lt;/a&gt; in rural Pennsylvania (no, there were no buggies involved). I'm more-or-less an agnostic now, but my thinking is still strongly influenced by Mennonite values of peacemaking, simplicity, and independent inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my first taste of field biology in my senior year of high school, when one of my science teachers led the class through a forest survey in a woodlot adjacent to the campus. By cataloguing the trees according to their age class and species, we were able to deduce how mature the woodland was, and what it might look like in another hundred years. It opened up this vision of species jostling against each other, accommodating as well as competing to shape the landscape right outside my front door, and it seemed like a pretty cool thing to do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From high school on I did my best to arrange to spend time outdoors. I majored in environmental science as an undergraduate, and then spent a year interning with the &lt;a href="http://www.paconserve.org"&gt;Western Pennsylvania Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;, working on plant community ecology among other projects. When I started to think about graduate school, I knew I wanted to study coevolution -- the ways in which interacting species shape each other's evolutionary history -- and I was lucky enough to connect with &lt;a href="http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~pellmyr/pellmyrlabfront.htm"&gt;Olle Pellmyr&lt;/a&gt;, who was looking for a new graduate student to work on his current study of Joshua trees and the moths that pollinate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joshua tree populations are exclusively pollinated by one or the other of two different species of yucca moths. It turns out that trees from populations with different pollinators &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/587757"&gt;look pretty different themselves&lt;/a&gt;, and we now have good reason to think that the moths' preferences for their "native" type of Joshua tree &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04428.x"&gt;determines how often the two tree types can interbreed&lt;/a&gt;. A big part of my dissertation work is to use DNA sampling from Joshua trees across the whole Mojave desert to estimate how completely the two types of Joshua tree are isolated, and how much coevolution with the moths is responsible for the differences we see in the two types of tree. Before I started grad school, I'd never seen a North American desert -- now I've been to just about every place Joshua trees grow, from the south rim of the Grand Canyon to the outer suburbs of Los Angeles and (I kid you not) just outside of Area 51.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Joshua Trees pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Joshua%20Trees%20pic.jpg" width="448" height="277" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dissertation is far and away my biggest preoccupation, you won't be surprised to hear. I've just had a couple of projects accepted for publication -- a literature review and an analysis that reconstructs some characteristics of the ancestors of yucca moths. I'm (hopefully) nearly done with a mathematical model that compares how different kinds of coevolutionary interactions affect the species involved, and I'm heavily occupied with the Joshua tree DNA analysis right now. My plan is to complete my doctorate by about this time next year, and I'm starting to think about possible postdoctoral work (hint, hint!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also keeping up with writing on &lt;a href="http://www.denimandtweed.com/" title=""&gt;Denim and Tweed&lt;/a&gt; for the time being, and I'm thinking about running what will be my second marathon sometime this fall. Hopefully, I'll find some time to get out and enjoy the wilderness out here in the Pacific Northwest this summer, too, since this might be the last year I spend within a day's drive of  both Olympic and Glacier National Parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most academic biologists spend time teaching in addition to their research, and I really believe that telling the general public about my work is a logical extension of that principle -- that being a scientist means communicating what you learn to others, not just accumulating knowledge to satisfy your own curiosity. The Web is a great venue for that, thanks to user-friendly blog hosting services and networks like &lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;Research Blogging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.natureblognetwork.com"&gt;the Nature Blog Network&lt;/a&gt; that connect interested readers to my site. I now list D&amp;amp;T as a &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2007/nsf07046/nsf07046.jsp"&gt;"broader impact"&lt;/a&gt; on all my grant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to treat &lt;a href="http://www.denimandtweed.com/" title=""&gt;Denim and Tweed&lt;/a&gt; as an exercise in writing about science for a general audience -- so it has that value for me even if no one reads it. In that sense, it's a little like a one-man journal club, in which I sit down every week and read one paper carefully enough to explain it to someone else in about 700 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blog is pretty heavily linked into my online social network as well -- I have a public account on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbyoder"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that I use regularly, and a &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/jeremyyoder"&gt;FriendFeed profile&lt;/a&gt; that ties together the blog, my &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jbyoder"&gt;Flickr account&lt;/a&gt;, and my &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/jbyoder"&gt;Facebook profile&lt;/a&gt;. And I interact with family, personal acquaintances, colleagues, and readers of D&amp;amp;T across all those platforms -- over my last field trip, I&amp;#39;d post photos from Flickr to the blog, and have folks comment about them on my Facebook wall. It&amp;#39;s not very tidy, but every one of those networks seems to reach a slightly different set of people, so I guess I&amp;#39;m thoroughly enmeshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been reading science blogs since long before it occurred to me to start writing on my own -- I don't remember exactly how I got started, but my first contact was probably when someone sent me a snarky link from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;. I think I probably didn't have a sense of the full scope of the science blogosphere before I found &lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;Research Blogging&lt;/a&gt;, though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through RB, I've found great sites like &lt;a href="http://evol-eco.blogspot.com"&gt;The EEB &amp;amp; flow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.conservationmaven.com"&gt;Conservation Maven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com"&gt;Open Source Paleontologist&lt;/a&gt;, and even occasionally exchanged thoughts in the comments or via back-and-forth posts. Research Blogging is really a fantastic way to get started in writing about science on your own blog, both because it's easy to add your posts to a feed lots of other science bloggers read and because it helps you find other people writing about the sort of science that interests you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, after I'd been involved in RB for more than a year, I was lucky enough to be able to attend ScienceOnline 2010, and meet in person a number of folks I really only knew as text on the screen -- and, yes, add a number of links to my RSS list, including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/"&gt;Observations of a Nerd&lt;/a&gt;. I think I picked up far more Twitter feeds than blogs at ScienceOnline, though -- so much of the conference conversation occurred on Twitter that it was basically unavoidable. And now I probably get more of my online science news via folks I'm following on Twitter than even through the RSS feeds I have bookmarked in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest benefit I took from ScienceOnline2010 was a better sense of where I fit in the world of online science communication, in my role as a scientist with a blog. I saw some great models of how to draw the public into ongoing scientific work using online tools, and even how to &lt;a href="http://opendino.wordpress.com/"&gt;engage the public in the actual science&lt;/a&gt;. I also saw some great sessions that addressed interactions among different groups of people involved in science communication -- working scientists, educators, and science journalists. It was a really fun weekend all around, and it gave me a lot to think about as I work towards the (still pretty distant!) day when I'm ready to set up my own lab and research program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scienceonline2010_-_interview_51.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/BKOGrBGKQy0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274973633158"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/extinction_of_the_old_evolutio_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c0a57530bf97b4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Extinction of the Old, Evolution of the New:  What really happened to the dinosaurs?</title><published>2010-05-27T16:10:36Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T16:10:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/mQlRY1Ny23U/extinction_of_the_old_evolutio_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/extinction_of_the_old_evolutio_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Many years ago, a sudden event occurred that changed everything.  Or at least, that is what we think now. But in truth, the event took longer than many today believe, and many of the specific details, the exact order of events, the actual meaning of each detail, are not fully understood.  Indeed, in the process of describing this event today, we find considerable disagreement, or at least, it is clear that one person's version is different than another's.  I'd be happy to give you my version of it.  What qualifies me to do that?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He started off his discussion by saying that there are two ideas (not theories, but ideas) of how life became how it is on Earth. He closed the classroom’s door. Once the door was closed, he glossed over the scientific explanation very quickly (less than 20 seconds), then explained Creationism for about five minutes (5000 year old Earth, no evolution, etc). He then said that accepted scientific thought is the first, and that’s what the school wants him to teach, “…but we all know which one is right.” WHOA! [...] After he finished his Creationism lecture, he opened the classroom door again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegads. That post was from April 23. Now that classes are over and grades finalized, on May 21 &lt;a href="http://jadeneternal.wordpress.com/2010/05/21/creationism-in-college-the-details/"&gt;Jaden gave details&lt;/a&gt;. He did what I would’ve: approached the Dean of Science and told her the biology teacher was a crackpot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[The Dean] acted like I was being unreasonable. She said two things that really sit poorly with me. She told me that he is completely entitled to share his opinions in class. Then, she said eluded to the fact that I’m being intolerant of his beliefs and need to show more respect for him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this is not public high school, so the teacher can, if he so pleases, teach that Thor created the Universe by cracking an ostrich egg in two and then dancing around nude on one foot while swinging a lawn mower blade around his head (being careful not to nick his winged helm, of course). He &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do that, but should he do that there should be repercussions. Just as there should be if he teaches creationism, a provably wrong idea that goes counter to everything a science class represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clearly the Dean disagrees. Here’s what Jaden learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What I took away from this meeting with Dr. Williams was that my school didn’t care about science content in its science classes. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s right. The next step I would take would be to talk to the people that accredit colleges in Oklahoma. I am not saying that Jaden’s college should have their accreditation taken away, but I certainly think a focused and deep investigation is warranted. What other wacky (and useless) stuff is being taught there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See more of our exclusive video chat with Piper Kerman, where she talks about the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/more-exclusive-video-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-on-guilt-forgiveness-and-redemption/"&gt;guilt and shame&lt;/a&gt; that resulted from her prison ordeal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age 34, Piper Kerman went to  federal prison for a ten-year-old    drug smuggling and money laundering offense.  She spent 13 months in a    minimum-security correctional facility for  women in Danbury, CT, which    isn’t necessarily what you’d expect from a  blonde-haired, blue-eyed    Smith graduate and Red Sox fan from a nice, New  England family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper’s excellent memoir about her prison experience, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385523386?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=randohouseinc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385523386target="&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was just  published    by Random House – with back cover blurbs by Dave Eggers and   Elizabeth   Gilbert (not bad for a first-time writer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper sat down with Blisstree for the afternoon to discuss all     aspects of her time in the clink, from &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/exclusive-video-our-conversation-with-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black/"&gt;skincare in prison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/more-exclusive-video-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-on-guilt-forgiveness-and-redemption/"&gt;guilt and forgiveness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/yoga-and-fitness-behind-bars-personal-insights-from-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-%E2%80%93-video-exclusive/"&gt;how yoga saved her sanity&lt;/a&gt;, to the torturous six years she and her   now-husband  spent in  limbo between her  conviction and the day she    self-surrendered in Danbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the 5th segment of our exclusive video interview with     Piper, where she talks about the unexpected friendships she forged on the inside, and how those relationships were the main reason she survived her sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And check back for Piper’s next video, coming soon – we even got     Piper’s husband, Larry Smith of &lt;a href="http://www.smithmag.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, to talk on camera about his  side of the story&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

is a guest post from Vanessa Woods, author of the new book, Bonobo Handshake. Vanessa is a Research Scientist in Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and studies the cognition of chimpanzees and bonobos in Congo.

When I wake up this morning, someone might try to kill me. I live 10 minutes from a small town called Durham, NC, where according to the last statistics, 22 people were killed, 76 women were raped, and there were 682 cases of aggravated assault. When a chimpanzee wakes up in the morning, they probably have the same thought. In fact, if you're a male chimpanzee, you're more likely to be killed by another chimpanzee than anything else. If you're a female chimpanzee, expect to be beaten by every adolescent male who is making his way up through the ranks.

People often ask me why humans are so intelligent, as in, what is it other apes lack that makes us so unique.

I'll tell you this: I would swap every gadget I own - my car, my laptop, the potential to fly to the moon - if I could wake up as a bonobo. No bonobo has ever been seen to kill another bonobo.

After the fuss made by various pro-life and religious groups about the advert for Marie Stopes International on Channel 4 that I wrote about &lt;a href="http://tessera2009.blogspot.com/2010/05/are-you-late.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I've picked a couple of religious reactions to specific cases of abortion to take a rational look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sister Margaret McBride is a nun, senior administrator and member of the ethics board at St Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. A 27 year old woman who was 11 weeks pregnant and already had four children, was admitted to the hospital with pulmonary hypertension and told by doctors that if she carried on with the pregnancy, the risk to her life was almost certainly 100%. &lt;/p&gt;

I really don't. I realize I rather harshly criticized him yesterday for being so hostile to the concept of "denialism," to the point where he characterized even the use of the term as a means of "suppressing" free speech. Normally, that criticism would have been enough. If Dr. Fitzpatrick answered, that would be all well and good; if he didn't, I'd move on and forget about it. Unfortunately, I was made aware of another article he published at his usual gig at Spiked Online entitled &lt;a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/8916/"&gt;Censorship is not the answer to health scares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn if it wasn't like waving a cape in front of a bull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is depressing when someone whose work and activism against pseudoscience and quackery you usually admire a lot lets you down in such a spectacular fashion. In this case, Dr. Fitzpatrick is not only once again characterizing the British General Medical Council (GMC) action to strip Andrew Wakefield of his medical license, a decision that was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, but he is also characterizing the sacking of Bruce Charlton, the editor of the distinctly cranky "journal" &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/em&gt; similarly, as the enforcement of "doctrinal orthodoxy" against the "heresy" of "questioning science." How I hate it when people mischaracterize science as religion as a way of defending cranks. I hate it even more when it's someone who really, really should know better, someone like Dr. Fitzpatrick, who otherwise has done yeoman work in opposing pseudoscience. Unfortunately, here he seemingly willfully confuses threats to free speech with legitimate attempts to maintain scientific, medical, and professional standards. The two are quite different, albeit related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fitzpatrick is rather clever, though, in how he frames it. He starts by castigating an excellent editorial that appeared in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.elsevier.com/locate/vaccine"&gt;Vaccine&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Gregory A. Poland, the Mary Lowell Leary Professor of Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Vaccine Research Group, and Ray Spier (D.Phil, FIChemE, FIBiol, FRSA) President of the International Society for Vaccines, Emeritus Professor of Science and Engineering Ethics, Former Professor of Microbiology at the University of Surrey, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6TD4-4YH525B-2&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_coverDate=03%2F11%2F2010&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=99eb1de5de38c48f9cf1979eb708e84e"&gt;Fear, misinformation, and innumerates: How the Wakefield paper, the press, and advocacy groups damaged the public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Sad, right?

Check out this exchange, from the 2004 movie Super Size Me:

Morgan Spurlock: [to kids] I'm gonna show you some pictures and I want you to tell me who they are.

Children: OK.

Morgan Spurlock: [Showing a picture of George Washington] Who's that?

Child: George Washington?

Morgan Spurlock: Good. Who was he?

Children: He was the 4th president. He freed the slaves. He could never tell a lie.

Morgan Spurlock: [Shows picture that you can't see] Who's that?

Child: George W. Bush?

Morgan Spurlock: No. That's a good guess though.

[Shows picture and its a picture of Jesus]

Morgan Spurlock: Who is this?

[Shows a picture of Wendy]

Child: Wendy!

Morgan Spurlock: Nice!

Morgan Spurlock: Who's that?

[Shows picture of Ronald MacDonald]

Child: MacDonald, Ronald MacDonald.

Child: MacDonald!

Morgan Spurlock: What does he do?

Child: He helps people at the cash register.

Child: He works at MacDonald's. I love the pancakes and sausage!

Child: He brings everyone of his friends to McDonald's for a Happy Meal

Morgan Spurlock: Where have you seen him?

Child: On television, on the commercials.

Child: He's the character that made McDonald's, and he does a lot of funny stuff on TV. 

Figure 1: I recognize all of these but Mr. Gatti's. Anyone know what this is? They must not have it in California.

You're probably not surprised that we readily recognize symbols of the fast food that is so ubiquitous in our society. But would you believe that even a brief subliminal delivery of those symbols can actually affect the your behavior, even when it comes to things having nothing at all to do with eating or food?

Even worse, at times (most times) we seem to be coming up against emotions and patterns of thought deeply rooted in evolution that nothing short of transcendence will solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three recent studies reinforce our worst fears about human nature and make it clear how much of an uphill battle we face. &lt;a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2010/05/psychological-barriers-facing-mmr.html"&gt;The first looks at attitudes toward the MMR vaccine &lt;/a&gt;and which sources parents trust the most. The researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five key themes emerged. Parents felt they didn’t have enough  information, especially in relation to the dangers associated with not  vaccinating. Government sources were not trusted. By contrast, other  parents were trusted: ‘Parents trust advice from other parents,’ one  mother said. ‘[You] take it on board. You listen to them.’ Parents also  revealed they were biased towards risk-related information. And they  misunderstood balance, believing that pro- and anti-MMR arguments should  be given equal weight even though the scientific evidence overwhelming  favours MMR vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this seems solvable, but part is inherent. The solvable parts include parents not having enough information regarding the dangers of not vaccinating. Lack of information is always the easiest problem to solve – make the information more readily available, especially to people when and where they are making decisions that will be informed by that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two elements are due to evolved human nature, and therefore are tough nuts to crack. Parents rely on information from other parents – more generally, people find stories much more compelling than data. It makes sense that our natural instincts would be inclined toward stories from our peers. It also makes sense that we would tend to believe and remember such stories, that they would be emotionally profound. In our evolutionary milieu, there was probably more to lose from being doubtful or forgetful of cautionary tales told to us by our peers, than from heeding them. In our complex modern society with phishing scams, used car salesmen, and urban legends, being gullible is probably more of a detriment than being skeptical, but even still we find ourselves riveted by a ripping yarn, especially one of harm that could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it should be no surprise that there are numerous grassroots parent groups forming that are basically built on parents or patients educating each other. Such groups come in all flavors – some are guided by a strong dedication to the science, others mix science with anecdote and myth without discrimination, and still others wonder off into a fantasy land of pseudoscience and conspiracy. They each develop their own subculture, mainly driven by person to person communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the study shows that people are more compelled by fear than reassurance. Medical decisions are best informed by a careful assessment of risk vs benefit – but emotionally we are much more compelled by the prospect of risk than the prospect of benefit. (Actually, this relationship is more complex and depends on context. People will accept great risk if the potential benefit is huge, like a cure for a terminal or serious illness. If the benefit is more abstract, like preventing a problem they do not currently have, then they focus on  risk.) Here again, we are much more likely to be compelled by one story of a side effect, than all the statistics about preventing illness. The difference in our emotional response to statistics vs our emotional response to dramatic stories largely explains why some people are afraid to fly, and why others fear vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two components of this research – lack of trust in government and favoring balance (even when the information is not balanced) may be more cultural than hard-wired. Either way, they are further barriers to educating the public about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123328312/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;The second study&lt;/a&gt; is, in some ways, even more disturbing than the first, because it strikes right at the heart of skeptical activism. Researchers find that when people are confronted with scientific information that directly challenges  a cherished belief, their typical response is to argue for the impotence of science – science is unable to prove or disprove my belief. That much is predictable, and any skeptic can tell you that this is a common response. However, the study takes it one step further – they found that people also, after being confronted, shift their belief toward thinking that science in general is impotent. This probably is a mechanism to reduce cognitive dissonance, but in any case confronting people with disconfirming scientific evidence tends to reduce their confidence in science in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen this in action with the anti-evolutionists. They not only reject the science of evolution, in their defense of their religious beliefs they often reject science as a methodology. The Discovery Institute has certainly done this, arguing that the materialistic paradigm of science (i.e. science) is crumbling (i.e. impotent). Once you distrust science it is easy to reject any scientific position you don’t like, so the DiscoTute has happily also chucked out modern neuroscience and climatology as well – it’s all an atheistic, materialistic, liberal conspiracy. It’s the snowball effect of anti-science. This study just confirms that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third study is in line with the previous two, &lt;a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp15_3.pdf"&gt;but looks at belief in ESP&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially they told several groups that ESP was either supported by 10% of the public vs 90% of the public or that it was either supported by or rejected by the scientific community. Every permutation of these two variables was tested. The results – people were more likely to regard ESP favorably if they were told that the majority of the public believed in it – we are compelled by the beliefs of our peers. We want to fit in. This is not surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbing, however, was the fact that people in this study were more likely to accept ESP if they were told scientists rejected it rather than accepted it. They took the opposite opinion of the scientific community. What process is at work here? Are they reflexively rejecting authority? Do they assume that scientists are closed-minded about the paranormal if they reject it, but if they accept it does that trigger some natural skepticism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the explanation, it seems that the natural instinct is the opposite of what it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to become depressed by this trifecta of studies, but they really don’t paint a picture different than what we already knew – people believe stories over science and come to their conclusions mostly for evolved emotional, rather than dry rational, reasons. These studies are helpful because they illuminate the details and hopefully will provide some guidance as we continue to search for strategies to promote science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274963619002"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=179811">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cfd59fa9279694a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><title type="html">EBOOST Double-Deal: EBOOST is offering Blisstree readers 25%</title><published>2010-05-27T12:30:43Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T12:30:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/179811/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EBOOST Double-Deal:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/win-win-save-25-on-eboost-pink-lemonade-and-fight-breast-cancer-with-susan-g-komen-for-the-cure/"&gt;EBOOST is offering&lt;/a&gt; Blisstree readers 25% off their pink lemonade and will donate $10 from each purchase to help fight &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/breast-cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=breast%20cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; with Susan G.

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am generally not the activist type. It’s not that I don’t have strong opinions or don’t care deeply about a variety of issues, but I just generally don’t like to go to rallies or protests. However, when I received an email two nights ago from &lt;strong&gt;Bruce Critelli&lt;/strong&gt; saying that the anti-vaxers were going to have a &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-vaccine-controversy-20100526,0,698067.story"&gt;rally right here in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and that the keynote speaker would be &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/strong&gt;, the man who recently &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off"&gt;lost the right to practice medicine&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and wrote the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield#MMR_controversy"&gt;thoroughly discredited study&lt;/a&gt; touting a link between vaccines and autism, I knew I had to go. I wasn’t planning on protesting and didn’t want to cause a scene — I just wanted to genuinely try to hear what they had to say… and document the event.  The &lt;a href="http://shop.womenthinkingfree.org/"&gt;Women Thinking Free Foundation&lt;/a&gt; mobilized quickly to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last class I ran out the door to catch the bus to downtown Chicago. I showed up 45 min late, but it seems I didn’t miss much. There were about 100 people there, though probably about half were wearing staff shirts and most had identical anti-vax signs that had been handed out by the rally organizers. There were a handful of people staying out of the way in the back handing out “&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;fact cards&lt;/a&gt;” with information discrediting Wakefield and providing true facts on the safety of vaccines. I didn’t join them because I didn’t want to be “outed” but I felt more comfortable knowing they were nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first walked in, my heart was pounding. I felt like any second someone there would see me and shout “She’s not one of us! Get her!” and a hundred mothers and their children would suddenly sprout fangs and attack me in a feeding frenzy. Instead I saw Bruce in the crowd and ran over to him so I’d have someone to talk to throughout the rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally the crowd consisted of mothers with their young children. It looked sweet until I started listening to what the speakers were actually saying. Words like “Nazis,” “eugenics,” “world order,” and other bogeymen brought up to terrify parents were tossed about with what seemed like utter disregard toward their true meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the speakers focused on painting a picture of the people who tout vaccines as evil. And, I’m not talking “&lt;strong&gt;Glenn Beck&lt;/strong&gt; evil” here, I mean Hitler/Al Queda evil. In their view, pharmaceutical companies commit blatant fraud, creating horrible, toxic, poisonous substances like vaccines and acetaminophen (yep, Tylenol is EVIL!) and then making up lists of benefits and selling it to the public under the lie that its good for you. And don’t forget the government. Clearly the government is in the pocket of BIG PHARMA (capitalized because every time anyone mentioned BIG PHARMA, it really sounded capitalized). They get money from BIG PHARMA in order to turn their heads even when they know people are taking fraudulent products, and some even get enough money to convince them to legislate mandates and subsidize vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, but while we’re at it, don’t forget your family doctor. S/he’s in on it too. See, they just really love to stick needles in your child’s arm. When you try to tell your doctor that you did that googling thing and read some stuff from a YouTube commenter on the internets and are &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; that your son got autism from vaccines, your doctor will just laugh and you. Why? Because doctors think they are so smart from going to school and hate mothers and children. That’s why they became pediatricians in the first place, just so they can poison children then laugh about it afterward while rolling in their BIG PHARMA money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this sounds like I’m exaggerating, but I’m completely serious. This is right along the lines of things said by speakers at the rally. Don’t believe me? &lt;a href="https://rcpt.yousendit.com/879486459/0d8fe25e5ad05e1d88a3797d854c2325"&gt;Listen to the song “Vaccine Gestapo”&lt;/a&gt; by The Refusers — really just one guy (&lt;strong&gt;Michael Belkin&lt;/strong&gt;) who sings along to a recording (serious!).  The &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/vaccine-gestapo-song-lyrics-fact-or-fiction/"&gt;lyrics are here&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only is it a terrible song but at the rally he played this song while mothers danced with their children. It was highly disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Refusers.jpg" alt="" title="Refusers" width="512" height="384"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, near the end of the rally the &lt;a href="http://tallguywrites.livejournal.com/148012.html"&gt;infamous Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; took the stage to cheers from a worshiping crowd. It was Andrew Wakefield, a victim of BIG PHARMA and a martyr to mother’s everywhere.  There are few people in the world that I can truly say I hate, but he is one of them. The damage that he has done by scaring parents into not vaccinating their children and thereby leaving them free to contract deadly-yet-preventable diseases is beyond words. In order to keep myself from running up onto the stage and punching him in his smug little face, I contented myself by reading snarky comments on Twitter from all the people watching on the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23antivaxrally"&gt;live internet feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hemant adds: You can see &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/12079650"&gt;Andrew Wakefield’s speech here&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://zenosarrow.blogspot.com/2010/05/andrew-wakefield-speaks-at-anti-vax-in.html"&gt;Zeno’s Arrow&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the rally I went and spoke with some of the other pro-science people who had showed up.  At some point Bruce and I saw that Andrew Wakefield was particularly accessible and decided that we wanted to get a picture of him. I went up to him and asked and next thing I knew Andrew Wakefield had his arm around me setting up for a happy, smiling picture. Up until this point I had been wearing my “Hug Me I’m Vaccinated” &lt;a href="http://surlyramics.com/Surlyramics/Surly_Ramics.html"&gt;Surly-Ramic necklace&lt;/a&gt; from Skepchick Amy hidden under my shirt. Right before the picture was taken I pulled it out and flashed a smile to the camera. Andrew Wakefield had no idea what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Wakefield-550x412.jpg" alt="" title="Wakefield" width="550" height="412"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From left to right, that’s me, Andrew Wakefield, and Bruce Critelli.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I left, I shook his hand and handed him a folded note I had handwritten the night before.  I asked him if he would read it later when he got a chance. He told me he would, thanked me, and put the note in his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The note said the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Andrew Wakefield,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that you truly believe that what you are doing is helping people and that the ends justify the means, but I just want you to know that the things you are doing –- the actions you have taken in the past have hurt people –- killed people. Your work has scared and manipulated parents into not vaccinating their children, putting them and their entire community at risk, all in the name of safety. Children have died because of you. I just want to make sure that you fully understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Jamie
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article grew out of two of my posts on this website from last August (&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/is-depression-an-evolutionary-adaptation-part-1/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/30/is-depression-an-evolutionary-adaptation-part-2/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  I felt especially compelled to write it because the authors of the study I critique think that the if depression is an evolved adaptation, psychiatrists should treat it with Darwinian remedies.  To them, this means using problem-solving talk therapies (not necessarily a bad thing, I guess, though I don’t see why this should always be the best approach), and, especially, withholding medication.  If depression is adaptive, so they say, then people should be encouraged to suffer through its pain to receive its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Evolutionary Calculus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;of Depression&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By Jerry A. Coyne, PhD | May 26, 2010&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dr Coyne is professor in the department of ecology and evolution,  biological sciences collegiate division, at The University of Chicago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  discipline of evolutionary psychology views modern human behaviors as  products of natural selection that acted on the psychological traits of  our ancestors. A subdiscipline, evolutionary psychiatry, tries to find  evolutionary explanations for mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most  common subjects of evolutionary psychiatry is depression. Although  debilitating, depression is also reasonably widespread. Estimates of its  prevalence in Western nations range between 5% and 20%, and the  disorder appears to depend at least partly on an individual’s genes. The  relatively high frequency of an apparently maladaptive and partially  genetic syndrome has led to speculation that it may really be “adaptive”  in an evolutionary sense—that is, a liability to depression may have  been installed in our genome by natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent  version of this idea is the &lt;em&gt;adaptive rumination hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; (“ARH”) of Andrews and Thomson,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; which posits that depression  evolved as a way to solve difficult and complex problems, most of them  involving social interactions. Instead of being a pathology, depression  is seen as a useful complex of thoughts and behaviors that enable  troubled people to withdraw from the world, deliberate intensively about  their social problems, and devise solutions. Andrews and Thomson  suggest this behavior evolved because it was adaptive in our ancestors,  and may still be so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARH has attracted a good deal of  attention, much of it favorable. It was, for example, the subject of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/magazine/28depression-t.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=depression%27s%20upside&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;a  recent article in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times Magazine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Debate  about the ARH is not purely academic, for Andrews and Thomson see the  idea as pointing to specific therapies, including problem-solving talk  therapies and the deliberate withholding of medication. Since these  suggestions stem from a specific evolutionary hypothesis, we should  carefully examine that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously discussed a  number of troubling problems with the ARH.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Andrews and  Thomson deliberately conflate clinical depression and simple sadness,  assuming that these are simply positions on a continuous psychological  gradient. They give no evidence that depression is caused by, rather  than the cause of, difficult social problems, and they fail to show that  depression actually helps people solve those problems. And many of the  “experiments” supporting the ARH are unrealistic, bordering on silly.  One such study mimicked the effect of depression on problem solving by  having people engage in mock currency trading while listening to sad  music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than repeat my critique, I want to discuss how  evolutionary biologists identify features as “adaptations,” and relate  this to evolutionary explanations of mental disorders such as the ARH. I  will show that depression does not meet the minimal requirements for &lt;em&gt;qualifying &lt;/em&gt;as a biological adaptation, and that even if it did, the  evolutionary explanation of the ARH—and of other “adaptive” theories for  depression—is scientifically unsound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ARH is unsatisfactory  for three reasons:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Depression is not an adaptation in the  evolutionary sense. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Andrews and Thomson consider depression an  “adaptation” because it supposedly helps the sufferer solve problems.  But an &lt;em&gt;evolutionary &lt;/em&gt;adaptation is more than something that is  merely useful. Biologists consider a trait adaptive only if that  behavior, and the genes producing it, enhance an individual’s &lt;em&gt;fitness&lt;/em&gt;—the  average lifetime output of offspring. It is this genetic advantage, and  the evolutionary changes in behavior it promotes, that is the essence  of adaptation by natural selection. To demonstrate that depression is an  evolved adaptation, then, we must show that it enhances reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrews  and Thomson don’t do this, or even try. And if they &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;try,  they probably wouldn’t succeed, for everything we know about depression  suggests that rather than enhancing fitness, it reduces it. The most  obvious issue is suicide, a word that, curiously, does not appear in  Andrews and Thomson’s text. Statistics show that those with major  depression are 20 times more likely to kill themselves than are  individuals in the general population.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Evolutionarily  speaking, this is a strong selective penalty. Depression also appears to  reduce libido and may make one unattractive as a sexual partner.  Andrews and Thomson point out depression’s “adverse effect on women’s  fertility and the outcome of pregnancy.”&lt;sup&gt;1,p.638&lt;/sup&gt; Other health  problems are comorbid with depression, although it’s not clear whether  depression is the cause or consequence of these problems. Finally,  studies show that depressed mothers provide poorer care of their  children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is counterevidence that depressive rumination  outweighs all these problems and enhances reproduction, Andrews and  Thomson don’t provide it. The evolutionary calculus for depression—as  for any psychological “adaptation”—demands an answer to this question: &lt;em&gt;how  does that condition affect your expected number of offspring?&lt;/em&gt; It is  odd that evolutionary psychiatrists neither answer this question nor,  with rare exceptions, consider it, especially because data on  reproductive output are not hard to gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the evolutionary  calculus is not favorable, one can still appeal to history: while  depression may not be adaptive now, maybe it was reproductively  advantageous in our ancestors. Perhaps the symptoms of depression were  less debilitating in the past, or there was a lower possibility of  suicide. Such appeals often smack of &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; special pleading,  especially because we’re largely ignorant of the conditions under which  our ancestors lived. Andrews and Thomson try this plea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A  design analysis does not require depressive rumination to be currently  adaptive because modern and evolutionary environments may differ in  important ways. . . All that is required is that on average, depressive  rumination helped people analyze and solve the problems they were  ruminating about in ancestral environments.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;1,p.644&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  is wrong. Appeals to problem solving in the past, as to the present,  must ultimately involve reproduction. Note too that if depressive  rumination no longer helps us solve problems, we can ignore Andrews and  Thomson’s suggested therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we need to consider other data  as well—data about the genetic basis of depression. And here the ARH  also fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ARH does not explain the existence of  genetic variation for depression. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;No evolutionary hypothesis  about depression is credible without specifying the nature of genetic  variation. It is most crucial to propose whether the genes producing  depression are &lt;em&gt;fixed &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;segregating&lt;/em&gt;. And both hypotheses  come with problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fixed” genes are those for which all  individuals have identical copies, presumably because those genes produced a form  of depressive rumination that was favored in all human populations.  Under this scenario, individuals do not vary genetically in their  liability to depression, so variation in the disorder reflects only the  different environments faced by different individuals (these  environments include nongenetic accidents of development).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under  the fixed-gene model it is impossible to show by pedigree analysis that  there is a “genetic basis” to depression, for those methods require the  existence of genetic variation among individuals. For the same reason  one could not demonstrate an evolutionary advantage of genes causing  depression, since everyone currently carries the same “depression  genes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomson and Andrews apparently reject this model because  they recognize that individuals do differ genetically in their  susceptibility to depression. They thus accept the second scenario: &lt;em&gt;segregating&lt;/em&gt; “depression genes,” in which variation among individuals results from  variation in both genes and the environmental circumstances that  precipitate the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But adopting the “segregating-gene”  hypothesis creates other problems, for now one has to explain not only  the selective advantage of depression but also &lt;em&gt;why genes producing it  are segregating.&lt;/em&gt; Genes with a uniform advantage should not show  this kind of variation. And population genetics theory tells us that the  biological conditions under which natural selection maintains genetic  variation for a trait are quite restrictive. One requires either that  heterozygotes (individuals carrying one copy of a “depression” gene and  one copy of a “nondepression” gene) have a higher fitness than  individuals having two identical copies of either gene, or that  environments vary over time or space in a way that depression genes are  favored at some times or places, and disfavored at others. And even in  this latter scenario, different environments have to appear in precisely  the correct frequency or spatial distribution lest a single, generally  adaptive form of the gene become fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Andrews and  Thomson—nor, as far as I know, any proponent of adaptive explanations  for mental disorders—describes what form of selection they see as  maintaining genetic &lt;em&gt;variation.&lt;/em&gt; Without such a hypothesis, any  adaptive theory cannot be taken seriously, much less experimentally  tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no reason to think that depression is an  adaptation rather than a pathology. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lacking evidence for a  reproductive advantage of depression, Andrews and Thomson see the malady  as an evolutionary adaptation for three other reasons: it is an “orderly”  syndrome (“there is a neurological orderliness [anhedonia and  biochemical effects on serotonin concentration that affects rumination]  that appears to specifically and proficiently promote analysis in  depressive rumination and is not likely to have evolved by chance”&lt;sup&gt;1,p.622&lt;/sup&gt;); it is relatively common both within and among cultures; and it has a  partial genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this suggests that depression is  an adaptation rather than a pathology. The “coordination” of symptoms is  a &lt;em&gt;post facto&lt;/em&gt; rationalization: with sufficient imagination, one  can view nearly any mental illness as an orderly and useful syndrome.  Schizophrenia, for example, could be considered a cluster of  “coordinated” symptoms that enable individuals to discard a reality that  is simply too painful to bear. Without information that depression  enhances reproduction, the idea of adaptive “coordination” is mere  storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, there are alternative  explanations for disorders that are fairly common and have some genetic  underpinning. Take alcoholism, which has an incidence similar to that of  depression (about 7%), and appears to have some genetic basis. But  nobody maintains that alcoholism is adaptive. Rather, it’s almost  certainly a pathological effect of an environmental change (the  discovery of fermentation and distillation) on an adaptive trait (the  evolved wiring and pleasure centers of our brain). Like the painful and  sometimes fatal childbirth that is the byproduct of selection for larger  human brains, depression could simply be a maladaptive byproduct of a  feature that is generally adaptive—perhaps the wiring of those brains.  Viewed in this way, depression could be a “spandrel,” a genetic  hitchhiker that is a byproduct of something else.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively,  genes that cause depression might have some advantage when &lt;em&gt;they are  present but do not produce the disorder.&lt;/em&gt; This can happen if the  condition has what geneticists call “variable penetrance”: 10% of  individuals carrying the dominant gene for retinoblastoma, for instance,  don’t develop the disease. Or, genes that cause depression only when  present in two copies could, when present in heterozygous (one-copy)  condition, have another, unknown advantage. Note that these two scenarios  offer an adaptive explanation for depression genes that do not view the  condition itself as adaptive. And both can be tested, for they predict  that the non-depressed relatives of depressives (who carry but don’t  express “depression genes”) should have higher reproductive output than  do non-depressed people whose relatives are also not depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  critique of the ARH applies, of course, to other adaptive explanations  of depression, including the plea for help theory,&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; the  social rank theory,&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and the depressive realism theory.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Further, some have suggested that depression is adaptive because it and  other affective disorders are associated with high creativity.&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; This suggestion is also dubious, as there is no evidence that depressed  people who are creative have a higher reproductive output than other  members of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrews and Thomson conclude that, in  view of the ARH, problem-solving therapies like cognitive behavioral  therapy are the go-to treatments for depression. Further, they say,  doctors should not be too hasty in prescribing antidepressant medication  because the afflicted should be willing to “endure the pain”&lt;sup&gt;1,p.645&lt;/sup&gt; in hopes of a more permanent, evolution-based cure. Indeed, one could  read the ARH as suggesting that depression should not be cured, but  cultivated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Andrews and Thomson’s prescriptions lose force to  the extent that they rest on a flawed biological premise. Of course  researchers should continue to compare talk therapies and to determine  which, if any, drugs are useful in alleviating depression. But in the  meantime, let’s not expropriate and distort evolutionary theory in a  misguided attempt to claim mental disorders as “adaptations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my limited experience, it&amp;#39;s fairly common to get some intellectual history in math courses — when and why and by whom a problem was posed, who tried to solve it how, what unexpected connections and applications it turned out to have when, and so on. However, I don&amp;#39;t think that I ever encountered an exam question that asked about stuff of this sort. Has there ever been a calculus exam that asked something like &amp;quot;What was the physical problem that led Joseph Fourier to invent the series named for him? Describe the &lt;a href="http://www.todayinsci.com/F/Fourier_JBJ/FourierPoliticianScientistBio.htm#experiment"&gt;experimental apparatus&lt;/a&gt; that he used to test his idea."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cultural expectation runs deep. Some years ago, when I was teaching &lt;a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis140/"&gt;Introduction to Cognitive Science&lt;/a&gt;, an engineering student came to me after the midterm exam to complain. There had been a question asking the students to connect a list of people (e.g. Turing, Frege, etc.) with a list of ideas (universal computation, predicate calculus, etc.).  I thought that the question was pretty much a gift, but the student had gotten it wrong, and she was clearly not used to getting things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is ridiculous", she said. "If I know how to solve a problem, what does it matter whether I know who first figured it out?"  She had assumed that the intellectual-history aspect of the lectures was a sort of non-nutritive filler, introduced for the benefit of those inferior students who couldn't digest a more concentrated and abstract diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I tried to be more careful to explain in an early lecture how the course was going to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274950834474"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=8353">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29108a4889b459f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science"/><category term="aeronautics"/><category term="sailing"/><title type="html">Sailing Directly Downwind… Faster Than the Wind</title><published>2010-05-27T09:00:22Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T09:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/05/27/sailing-directly-downwind%e2%80%a6-faster-than-the-wind/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s one of those annoying brain teasers that turns half the people in the room against the other half, a simple engineering riddle that even professional aeronautical engineers get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s well known that racing boats can travel faster than the wind when traveling to windward. The fastest boats, and especially &lt;a href="http://www.idniyra.org/articles/IceboatSailingPerformance.html"&gt;ice boats&lt;/a&gt; and land yachts, can even beat the wind downwind by sailing off the wind at an angle. This is because a boat is not driven by the true wind, but by the apparent wind. When you move at some angle relative to the wind, the apparent wind changes its speed and direction. Lift and drag (including friction) all factor into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D10476453%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=300" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sailing directly downwind poses a different challenge. The apparent wind’s angle never changes, and the apparent windspeed approaches zero the faster you go. And so, from a superficial examination, this proposition should be impossible. And, using a conventional sail, it is indeed impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when you change things up by replacing the sail with a windmill that drives wheels, it is possible to go directly downwind faster than the wind. Since the windmill’s blades are spinning, there is always apparent wind that can be used to generate lift. Moreover, the tips of the windmill blades are moving much faster than the wind, so the true wind speed is actually not all that big a factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foul, you may cry. Once the vehicle is traveling directly downwind at exactly the same speed as the wind, there is zero apparent wind. Thus, there’s no impetus for it to accelerate any faster. If the apparent wind on the spinning windmill blades caused the vehicle to accelerate, it would have to be an impossible perpetual motion machine. Right? Hmmm… Well, don’t worry. &lt;a href="http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/propulsion/ddwfttw-directly-downwind-faster-than-wind-25527.html"&gt;Internet forums where this problem has been discussed&lt;/a&gt; run thousands of posts long. Even professional aeronautical engineers can’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Bauer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Bauer" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Bauer-225x324.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Douglas Aircraft model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been testing this for a long time. The latest is a group working with the San Jose State University aeronautical department, &lt;a href="http://www.fasterthanthewind.org/"&gt;Dead Downwind Faster Than The Wind&lt;/a&gt; (DDWFTTW, lots of stuff on their web site), with corporate sponsorship from &lt;a href="http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/nikos/grants.htm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and wind energy company Joby Energy. A video of one of their prototype’s vehicle’s test runs is posted here. They cite a test cart built in the 1960’s, as a result of such a disagreement between two engineers at Douglas Aircraft. Reportedly, it managed to travel downwind at 1.2x true wind speed. The DDWFTTW has traveled at more than 2x true wind, and is aiming for 3x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple. No stored energy can be used. The vehicle must travel directly downwind, not at some offwind angle. The only power allowed to drive the wheels is the windmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest thing about this is to get your mind away from the concept of apparent wind on the vehicle, and think instead about apparent wind on the windmill blades. It’s way too easy to get stuck on this point, but you have to remember that apparent wind on the vehicle is not relevant to the blades’ lift, even though it’s coming from what intuitively seems like the “wrong” direction. It is relevant to the drag, and as such, it is still a variable in the equation. Friction, weight, and wind resistance must be minimized, because once you exceed the true windspeed, these all work against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But watch the video. Yes, it’s possible that SJSU, Google, and Joby Energy are all being hoaxed here. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274948112303"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/clock_quotes_667.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a437830bccb82e2a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2010-05-27T08:58:16Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T08:58:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/CbIWLIF6q2M/clock_quotes_667.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/clock_quotes_667.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"I love my cats because I love my home, and little by little they become its visible soul."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out though that these very same “toxins” they’ve been complaining about can be found in many, if not all, supplements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the herbal &lt;a title="Recent and archival health news about dietary supplements and  herbal remedies." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/dietarysupplementsandherbalremedies/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt; tested  in a Congressional investigation contained trace amounts of lead and  other contaminants, and some supplement sellers made illegal claims that  their products can cure &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Cancer." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases, investigators  found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The levels of heavy metals — including mercury, cadmium and arsenic —  did not exceed thresholds considered dangerous, the investigators found.  However, 16 of the 40 supplements tested contained pesticide residues  that appeared to  exceed legal limits, the investigators found. In some  cases, the government has not set allowable levels of these &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Pesticides." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/pesticides/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;pesticides&lt;/a&gt; because of a paucity of  scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators found at least nine products that made apparently illegal  health claims, including a product containing ginkgo biloba that was  labeled as a treatment for &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Alzheimer&amp;#39;s Disease." href="http://www.nytimes.com/info/alzheimers-disease/?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and a product  containing ginseng labeled as a treatment to prevent &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Diabetes." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and cancer. They also described a  salesperson at a supplement specialty store who claimed that a garlic  supplement could be taken instead of &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Blood Pressure." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/test/blood-pressure/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any product that claims to treat, cure, prevent or mitigate a disease is  considered a drug and must go through strict regulatory reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, busted!&lt;/p&gt;

I can't decide among these 3 new papers:Sometimes, Categorical Statements about Prefrontal Neurons Are Just Wrong(1) Earl K. Miller (2007) in The Prefrontal Cortex: Categories, Concepts, and Cognitive Control (PDF):There was virtually no category effect across the ITC [inferior temporal cortex] population and no examples of neurons whose activity showed the sharp across-distinction/within-category generalization that is the behavioral signature of categorization. Rather, ITC neurons were sensitive to the physical appearance of the individual stimuli; its neurons did not “throw away” information about individuals in favor of the category groupings, like PFC [prefrontal cortex] neurons did. This finding suggests that learned visual categories are abstracted at the level of the PFC, not in visual cortex.No, not really. Monkeys were able to easily learn visual categories when their  lateral prefrontal cortices were ablated bilaterally, IF they were tested using an incentive value task (Minamimoto et al., 2010). Earlier single-unit recording studies (reviewed in the Miller 2007 chapter) required maintenance of a set of two stimulus-response mappings. Thus PFC might be necessary for rule-based response  selection, but not for visual categorization.Minamimoto T, Saunders RC, Richmond BJ (2010). Monkeys Quickly Learn and Generalize Visual Categories without Lateral Prefrontal Cortex. Neuron 66:501-507.Categorization is a basic mental process that helps individuals distinguish among groups of negative and positive objects, e.g., poisons and nutrients, or predators and prey. Monkey experiments have suggested that lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) participates in learning and processing visual categories. However, in humans category specific visual agnosia follows inferior temporal cortex but not LPFC damage. Here, we use a new behavioral approach to show that both normal monkeys and those with bilateral removal of LPFC learn and generalize perceptual categories of related visual stimuli rapidly without explicit instruction. These results strongly indicate that visual categorization occurs at some earlier stage of feed-forward processing, presumably in temporal cortex, without top-down information from LPFC.Minamimoto et al.'s incentive value task is shown below.Figure 1 (A) Sequence of events during a trial of the reward-delay task. A visual  cue (Cue) indicates size and delay interval for the reward after  successful behavioral reaction (bar release within 200–3000 ms after  green target appears).You Are What You Eat, or Don't Eat(2) Empathy and Diet? Are vegetarians too sensitive, or more empathetic? And those vegans, they're out of control!Filippi M, Riccitelli G, Falini A, Di Salle F, Vuilleumier P, Comi G, Rocca MA (2010). The Brain Functional Networks Associated to Human and Animal Suffering  Differ among Omnivores, Vegetarians and Vegans. PLoS ONE 5(5):       e10847.Empathy and affective appraisals for conspecifics are among the hallmarks of social interaction. Using functional MRI, we hypothesized that vegetarians and vegans, who made their feeding choice for ethical reasons, might show brain responses to conditions of suffering involving humans or animals different from omnivores. We recruited 20 omnivore subjects, 19 vegetarians, and 21 vegans. The groups were matched for sex and age. Brain activation was investigated using fMRI and an event-related design during observation of negative affective pictures of human beings and animals (showing mutilations, murdered people, human/animal threat, tortures, wounds, etc.). Participants saw negative-valence scenes related to humans and animals, alternating with natural landscapes. During human negative valence scenes, compared with omnivores, vegetarians and vegans had an increased recruitment of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). More critically, during animal negative valence scenes, they had decreased amygdala activation and increased activation of the lingual gyri, the left cuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex and several areas mainly located in the frontal lobes, including the ACC, the IFG and the middle frontal gyrus. Nonetheless, also substantial differences between vegetarians and vegans have been found responding to negative scenes. Vegetarians showed a selective recruitment of the right inferior parietal lobule during human negative scenes, and a prevailing activation of the ACC during animal negative scenes. Conversely, during animal negative scenes an increased activation of the inferior prefrontal cortex was observed in vegans. These results suggest that empathy toward non conspecifics has different neural representation among individuals with different feeding habits, perhaps reflecting different motivational factors and beliefs.How did the authors get the idea for this experiment??How Dare You! I Feel So Guilty! This Is an Outrage!(3) Oh no! The neural correlates of "moral sentiments"? Smells like phrenology to me...Green S, Ralph MA, Moll J, Stamatakis EA, Grafman J, Zahn R. Selective functional integration between anterior temporal and distinct fronto-mesolimbic regions during guilt and indignation. Neuroimage 2010 May 19. [Epub ahead of print].It has been hypothesized that the experience of different moral sentiments such as guilt and indignation is underpinned by activation in temporal and fronto-mesolimbic regions and that functional integration between these regions is necessary for the differentiated experience of these moral sentiments. A recent fMRI study revealed that the right superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was activated irrespective of the context of moral feelings (guilt or indignation). This region has been associated with context-independent conceptual social knowledge which allows us to make fine-grained differentiations between qualities of social behaviours (e.g. "critical" and "faultfinding"). This knowledge is required to make emotional evaluations of social behaviour. In contrast to the context-independent activation of the ATL, there were context-dependent activations within different fronto-mesolimbic regions for guilt and indignation. However, it is unknown whether functional integration occurs between these regions and whether regional patterns of integration are distinctive for the experience of different moral sentiments. Here, we used fMRI and psychophysiological interaction analysis, an established measure of functional integration to investigate this issue. We found selective functional integration between the right superior ATL and a subgenual cingulate region during the experience of guilt and between the right superior ATL and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex for indignation. Our data provide the first evidence for functional integration of conceptual social knowledge representations in the right superior ATL with representations of different feeling contexts in fronto-mesolimbic regions. We speculate that this functional architecture allows for the conceptually differentiated experience of moral sentiments in healthy individuals....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

This gambit is popular among the certifiably insane whose views are so utterly stupid and debunked that they dishonestly try to appeal to Americans’ sense of democracy and fair play even though reality isn’t up for a vote. Creationists have their “academic freedom” rhetoric too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really just boils down to what I call the “I’m just sayin’…” gambit or, for those who have seen the film Thank You For Smoking, the “Ice Cream Freedom” gambit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/XhFbuoV_T5U%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26showinfo%3D1%26iv_load_policy%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Nick Nailor explains in the film clip above, this is just a tactic used to distract people from the real debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for the ‘health freedom’ rally in Chicago, Mr. Andy Wakefield, fresh off his losing his license to kill, I’m told was the keynote speaker. There were also satellite  rallies in Edison, New Jersey, Washington, and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn’t worry too much. I went over to the NYC rally. I was planning  on just recording whatever speech they had planned and trying to get  some short interviews with people without coming out as a critic of their views. But when I  found the place, they kept one of the doors open to the outside and I could plainly see  that there were only about ten people in the room. This was a half hour after  it was supposed to start and I hung out outside for a little while. No  one else seemed to show up, so I didn’t even bother to go in. I just left. Now  maybe this just wasn’t very well publicized. Or maybe they just don’t  have the numbers we all feared they had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we were able to get 400 people to attend the North East Conference on Science and Skepticism (NECSS) this year and all they could muster in NYC for their big event was ten people, I think we’re in pretty good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/my-day-at-an-anti-vaccination-rally/"&gt; I’ve only read one in depth report of what actually went on at the Chicago Rally&lt;/a&gt;, and from that account, it sounds like the vaccine denialists have a worse case of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMOh9L60FKw"&gt;“Nazi Tourrettes” &lt;/a&gt;than Glenn Beck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/"&gt;But here’s also an hilarious report from a skeptical group that attended the Chicago rally&lt;/a&gt;…and got their pictures taken with Mr. Wakefield…while handing him a note telling him what a scumbag he is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Andrew Wakefield,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that you truly believe that what you are  doing is helping  people and that the ends justify the means, but I just want you  to know  that the things you are doing – the actions you have taken in the past   have hurt people – killed people. Your work has scared and manipulated   parents into not vaccinating their children, putting them and their  entire community  at risk, all in the name of safety. Children have died  because of you. I  just want to make sure that you fully understand  that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**********&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPIC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JdyKmzEdHws%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The riot happened because radical Muslims were offended by this drawings of Muhammad with a dog’s body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iKcZ3qcCmyo/Ru2MV8GO9kI/AAAAAAAAAc4/NO1AJdamPVY/s400/LarsVilks.bmp"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iKcZ3qcCmyo/Ru2MV8GO9kI/AAAAAAAAAc4/NO1AJdamPVY/s400/LarsVilks.bmp" title="DogMuhammad" width="314" height="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Uppsala University is inviting Vilks back in the fall to &lt;a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/may/25/swedish-university-re-invites-muhammad-artist/"&gt;complete the lecture&lt;/a&gt; he was giving.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The university said Tuesday that people shouldn’t be silenced by “violence and threats.” It said police and university officials will review the security situation before the new lecture.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them!  They are supporting the right to free speech and not caving in to the demands of the violent Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every newspaper in the world should be reproducing Vilks’ drawings or other drawings of Muhammad.  It’s time they take a stand for the free speech which they claim to support so strongly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The work was carried out in nematode worms, but the track record of such metabolic influences upon longevity carrying through into higher animals is pretty good so far. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) peptide induces cellular proliferation through the EGF receptor ... Inhibitors of the EGF receptor are being pursued as potential cancer therapies and EGF may stimulate wound healing. Mutation of the EGF receptor has been associated with cancer in humans. The best known of the metabolic mechanisms influencing longevity are those involved in insulin metabolism and calorie restriction - there may be some overlap between the two when all is said and done. The researchers here were in fact surprised to find that the results of their work did not point to insulin metabolism. Here's a reference to the paper: Improving health of the rapidly growing aging population is a critical medical, social, and economic goal. Identification of genes that modulate healthspan, the period of mid-life vigor that precedes significant functional decline, will be an essential part of the effort to design anti-aging......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

One of the concerns was that electromagnetic background fields of 2 milligauss might cause cancer (for comparison the earth’s magnetic field is 500 milligauss and fields generated by human physiological processes are hundreds of thousands of times less than 2 milligauss). Monitors of outdoor exposure for children to wear were marketed to parents. “Some city regulations sought to constrain B fields to less than 2 milligauss”. The report, which was a comprehensive study of the alleged dangers, included both molecular and epidemiologic studies and found that no adverse health effects could be attributed to these low fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the conclusions emphasized that physical calculations rule out carcinogenic effects because at physiological temperatures thermal noise fields in human cells are larger than the background fields from power lines.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Thus the political agenda, concerned with fear of carcinogenic mechanisms arising from low level magnetic fields, lost credibility. However, about 10 years later claims for health effects from mattress pads equipped with small magnets were marketed. A study of this was funded by National Institute of Health’s Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and claims for their benefits were published in alternative medicine journals.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the rationale for the claims were ludicrous. I attended one sales pitch which claimed their mattress magnets were better because they incorporated only North Poles. About  the same time, small 300 gauss magnets, began to appear on the shelves of drug stores. In 2007 a lawsuit brought by the National Council against Health Fraud against advertisers of these products was successfully settled. I was one of the persons who agreed to appear as an expert witness if needed. The Federal Trade Commission also threatened to prosecute purveyors who claimed healthful benefits for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, in the last few years the health and medical and nursing communities in their ‘integrated medicine’ outreach are now marketing the unsubstantiated claims that healing fields of 2 milligauss are emitted from the hands of practitioners.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note4"&gt;4,5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This belief in distance healing, Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, and Qiqong cobble the language of physics with the language of physiology, misleading the patient. For example, in Therapeutic Touch the protocol requires that a therapist moves his or her hands over the patient’s “energy field,” allegedly “tuning” a purported “aura” of biomagnetic energy that extends above the patient’s body. This is thought to somehow help heal the patient. (Curiously, the rubrics never define what may happen if the practitioner is inept.) Although this is less than one percent of the strength of Earth’s magnetic field, corresponding to billions of times less energy than the energy your eye receives when viewing even the brightest star in the night sky, and is billions of times smaller than that needed to affect biochemistry, the web sites of prominent clinics nevertheless market the claims&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note5"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This belief has been published in the peer reviewed medical literature.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Silence on this issue by the major scientific societies is a serious compromise of the scientific endeavors of those of us who work at the frontier of physics, medicine and biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms, &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;field&lt;/em&gt;, are used by alternative medicine practitioners, and integrative medicine physicians without any understanding of their meaning — their on-line and public lectures impart the pretense that fields are unknown philosophical constructs. Invited speakers at medical meetings at major academic institutions philosophize relationships between phenomena of many different magnitudes and sources, such as dark matter and biochemistry. The laws of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism are responsible for the biochemical bonding of molecules. Scientists understand that the discovery of dark matter is associated with the gravitational forces in our universe. No formulation of the properties of dark matter could have any observable effects between individual molecules in a cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a tutorial on fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission of a force when objects are not in contact is represented by a set of vectors defined at all points in space which enumerate the direction and magnitude of the force. This set of vectors constitutes the field. There are four fundamental forces: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear and strong nuclear. Other fundamental forces have been looked for and not found. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that science may one day find a new force field, but should such a discovery occur it will be through using the tools and methodology of science. Theorists understand that the strength of such a force must be much less than our weakest known force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a gravitational field which causes an object near the surface of the earth to fall with acceleration such that its velocity increases each sec by 32 feet per sec. Further out from our planet this number is less. Place signs with these numbers all over space and you have a picture of the field and its associated  ‘action at a distance’ force.  Knowing these numbers allows us to build rockets and satellites and explore outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly we know the numbers for electromagnetic fields. This allows us to build MRI machines. Ultrasonic imaging arises from us knowing the numbers at the level of cells to image the densities in tissues. We are constantly bathed in electromagnetic fields from communication devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of equations for these forces and the enumeration of the strength of their fields underlie our current technology. When energy fields are used as a medium for conveying information, scientists ask and answer the following key questions: How large is the signal? What is the transmitter located in the source, and what and where is the receiver? How can the device be tuned and detuned? Lastly, how can one replicate this by a device to be used for medical intervention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged source of TT’s purported biomagnetic field is the practitioner, and the alleged receiver is the patient. Beyond this, TT practitioners fail to give detailed and plausible answers to the key questions above. TT practitioners’ adoption of the scientific term “biomagnetic” field, without an equation to describe the field and without any grounding in known physics and biochemistry, conveys the impression of scientific respectability to claims that have no scientific basis. Its claims are anecdotal and no measurements such as blood work or respiratory function are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure your ENT or GP would never suggest visits to a TT practitioner to cure a hearing loss. Practitioners of alternative medicine never recommend it as an  intervention for a condition that  has an easily measurable physiological response. The clinical trials using TT associated with the 1.8 million dollar NIH grant, which were to measure the health of women with cervical cancer, were completed in 2006 and 2007&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/#note8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but a recent search using Clinical Trials .gov data base yields no reported results. Curiously, expert scientific opinion, and inventions using fields are welcomed by the evidence-based medical community but rejected by the integrative medicine community when this knowledge contradicts belief systems purported to be medically healing.&lt;/p&gt;

I really don't. I realize I rather harshly criticized him yesterday for being so hostile to the concept of "denialism," to the point where he characterized even the use of the term as a means of "suppressing" free speech. Normally, that criticism would have been enough. If Dr. Fitzpatrick answered, that would be all well and good; if he didn't, I'd move on and forget about it. Unfortunately, I was made aware of another article he published at his usual gig at Spiked Online entitled &lt;a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/8916/"&gt;Censorship is not the answer to health scares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn if it wasn't like waving a cape in front of a bull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really is depressing when someone whose work you normally admire a lot lets you down in such a spectacular fashion. In this case, Dr. Fitzpatrick is not only once again characterizing the British General Medical Council (GMC) action to strip Andrew Wakefield of his medical license, a decision that was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, but he is also characterizing the sacking of Bruce Charlton, the editor of the distinctly cranky "journal" &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/em&gt; similarly, as the enforcement of "doctrinal orthodoxy." How I hate it when people mischaracterize science as religion as a way of defending cranks. I hate it even more when it's someone who really, really should know better, someone like Dr. Fitzpatrick, who otherwise has done yeoman work in opposing pseudoscience. Unfortunately, here he seemingly willfully confuses threats to free speech with legitimate attempts to maintain scientific, medical, and professional standards. The two are quite different, albeit related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fitzpatrick is rather clever, though, in how he frames it, starting by ranting about an excellent editorial that appeared in the journal &lt;a href="http://www.elsevier.com/locate/vaccine"&gt;Vaccine&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Gregory A. Poland, the Mary Lowell Leary Professor of Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Vaccine Research Group, and Ray Spier (D.Phil, FIChemE, FIBiol, FRSA) President of the International Society for Vaccines, Emeritus Professor of Science and Engineering Ethics, Former Professor of Microbiology at the University of Surrey, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6TD4-4YH525B-2&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_coverDate=03%2F11%2F2010&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=99eb1de5de38c48f9cf1979eb708e84e"&gt;Fear, misinformation, and innumerates: How the Wakefield paper, the press, and advocacy groups damaged the public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Dr. Fitzpatrick characterizes the article:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/repeat_after_me_enforcing_medical_and_sc.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/repeat_after_me_enforcing_medical_and_sc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/OrsD-JD-K6I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274931448014"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/south_african_mystery_flowers.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad7c30dff9b204f7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="random photograph"/><title type="html">South African Mystery Flowers</title><published>2010-05-27T04:31:06Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T04:31:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/hrv4pMnc2cI/south_african_mystery_flowers.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/south_african_mystery_flowers.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://gregladen.com/secret_folder/DSC_4101.jpg" alt="a picture of something" width="500"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/south_african_mystery_flowers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/hrv4pMnc2cI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274931119359"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/?p=1992">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de7121fecdd82036</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="medical woo"/><category term="skeptical community"/><category term="alt-med"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="American Rally for Personal Rights"/><category term="Andrew Wakefield"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="anti-vaccination movement"/><category term="anti-vaccinationists"/><category term="anti-vax"/><category term="anti-vaxxers"/><category term="autism"/><category term="AVM"/><category term="Big Pharma"/><category term="Chicago"/><category term="conspiracy"/><category term="green our vaccines"/><category term="health"/><category term="Hug Me"/><category term="Hug Me I'm Vaccinated"/><category term="Jenny McCarthy"/><category term="Lancet"/><category term="mecury"/><category term="medicine"/><category term="mmr"/><category term="protest"/><category term="rally"/><category term="squalene"/><category term="thimerisol"/><category term="vaccine"/><category term="Wakefield"/><category term="Women Thinking Free Foundation"/><category term="WTFF"/><title type="html">Skeptics PWN Anti-Vax Scumbag Wakefield at His Own Rally</title><published>2010-05-27T03:31:53Z</published><updated>2010-05-27T03:31:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/27/skeptics-pwn-anti-vax-scumbag-wakefield-at-his-own-rally/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Check out &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-skeptical-pwnage-of-darth-wakefield-his-anti-vax-woosters-continues/"&gt;my follow-up&lt;/a&gt; post for more news, photos, and video of this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;============&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, congratulate me folks – I’m now officially part of a squad of skeptical ninjas &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there was an &lt;a href="http://americanpersonalrights.org/"&gt;anti-vaccination rally in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, and the king of &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/antivaccination.html"&gt;anti-vax woo &amp;amp; nonsense&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="http://tallguywrites.livejournal.com/148012.html"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; himself – showed up.  I suppose he decided to hang with his anti-vax homies here in the U.S. seeing as how he’s essentially &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8695267.stm"&gt;lost his license to practice medicine in the United Kingdom because of his fraudulent work there.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the new skeptical group I’m part of, the &lt;a href="http://shop.womenthinkingfree.org/"&gt;Women Thinking Free Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (WTFF), caught wind of this wave of woo headed our way (we’re based in Chicago) and we decided, with two days notice, to mobilize and counter protest… and we did!  I did not personally attend the counter protest, as I had to teach today, but I and many others were working behind the scenes to help organize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word went out like wildfire across the Internet – via email, Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and message boards – and we were able to gather a group of about 10 people there.  In addition, our WTFF ninjas were able to hand out plenty of pro-vaccine literature to passers-by who might have otherwise thought that Wakefield and his ilk weren’t batcrap crazy.  Here are some examples of our handouts we whipped up as part of WTFF’s new &lt;a href="http://hugmeimvaccinated.org/"&gt;“Hug Me, I’m Vaccinated!” campaign…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hugmeimvaccinated.org/"&gt;&lt;img title="hug me" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/hug-me.jpg?w=613&amp;amp;h=781" alt="" width="613" height="781"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It went really well.  Apparently, a whopping 50-100 anti-vaxxers showed  up; ironically, with just a couple of more days of prep &amp;amp;  organization, we might have been able to have almost as many pro-science  people there. In addition to handing out literature, our skeptical ninjas also took some photos &amp;amp; video, which I will share with you after it is all processed.  Until then, I leave you with this little gem…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-scumbag.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="wakefield scumbag" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/wakefield-scumbag.jpg?w=518&amp;amp;h=388" alt="" width="518" height="388"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That’s Wakefield in the middle, unwittingly posing with two of our  skeptical ninjas  who infiltrated his rally.  In fact, the girl is wearing a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://surlyramics.com/Surlyramics/Surly_Ramics.html"&gt;Surlyramics necklace&lt;/a&gt; that says &lt;em&gt;“Hug  Me, I’m Vaccinated!”&lt;/em&gt; and moments before this snapshot was taken she  handed him a note.  It said how much of a horrible person he is for  spreading anti-vax nonsense and scaring people out of vaccinating their  children.  She told me that he didn’t look at it &amp;amp; just put it in  his pocket, thinking that he got the phone number from some hot young  lady.  Here is the text of what she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Andrew Wakefield,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that you truly believe that what you are  doing is helping people and that the ends justify the means, but I just want you  to know that the things you are doing – the actions you have taken in the past  have hurt people – killed people. Your work has scared and manipulated  parents into not vaccinating their children, putting them and their entire community  at risk, all in the name of safety. Children have died because of you. I  just want to make sure that you fully understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**********&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message to Wakefield and the anti-vax woosters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.randi.org/vbimghost.php?do=displayimg&amp;amp;imgid=14038"&gt;&lt;img src="http://forums.randi.org/imagehosting/thum_774748eecf6cb2422.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/05/two-sides-in-vaccine-safety-debate-converge-on-chicago.html"&gt;Btw, we also got some press from a Chicago news outlet &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reasonably sure there will be more  photos &amp;amp; video to follow.   Watch this space for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;This whole affair was, in my humble opinion, an outstanding success.  In this “Hug Me!” event, we have officially put Wakefield and his ilk on notice that anywhere they go, they’re likely to be confronted by skeptics who are willing to stand up to their nonsense &amp;amp; fear-mongering woo.  We at WTFF hope that this event will serve as a template for other skeptical &amp;amp; pro-science groups to follow in monitoring &amp;amp; holding pseudoscientific folk like Wakefield accountable in the court of public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the usual word for "frog" in modern Greek is &lt;em&gt;batrachos&lt;/em&gt;, but all of Greece is referring to the current batrachian horde with the Biblical word &lt;em&gt;tzfardei'a&lt;/em&gt;.  In so doing, I suppose they wish to recall the Biblical plague of frogs that God inflicted on Egypt (the second of ten plagues that he sent against the Egyptians).  In fact, the plague of frogs was meant as an attack on the Egyptian frog goddess Heqt, whose job it was to assist women in labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In ancient societies and in many modern cultures as well, frogs symbolize fertility because of the vast amount of eggs that they lay.  The description of the frog swarms (&lt;em&gt;vesharatz&lt;/em&gt;) is reminiscent of the proliferation of the Israelites as &lt;em&gt;vayishretzu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frog (&lt;em&gt;tzfardei'a&lt;/em&gt;) is the only amphibian mentioned in the Bible, though the word may also have included the toad (which is &lt;em&gt;karpadah&lt;/em&gt; in modern Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that the present Greek frog crisis is thought to be of biblical proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

In my capacity as &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/prospectivestudents/coursesofstudy/serp/faculty.html"&gt;Visiting Scholar&lt;/a&gt; there, I helped some of the students think through how to work blogs into their training at NYU. Mainly, I urged them to think about how to not be boring. I suggested they set up blogs that they themselves would actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to write, and that weren’t like a lot of other blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;And they did! Kids these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So check out &lt;a href="http://www.scienceline.org/topic/blogs/"&gt;the whole blog roll&lt;/a&gt;, and offer your deeply insightful and constructive critiques. They’re waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now the actual study by the real scientists &amp;amp; researchers involved has been published, and – lo and behold – it paints a very different picture from the fear-mongering goobers at the NYPost.  In part, their conclusion states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference,&lt;a href="http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ije/press_releases/freepdf/dyq079.pdf"&gt; the entire study is available here in PDF format.&lt;/a&gt; Now of course I’m not surprised in the least by these results, seeing as how, based upon the laws of physics as we know them, &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/electromagnetic-fields-cancer-myths/"&gt;there is no plausible mechanism by which such low-energy emissions from cellphones could cause cancer!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would hope that various media outlets would take a lesson from this fiasco, but I suppose some people are more interested in selling paper than responsible news reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t know about anyone else, but I’ve been traveling like a mad person.  The good news is that I just got back from UC Davis, where I had the chance to meet John Conway for the first time in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is:  no time for blogging.  But I recently received an email pointing out that some links have died in an old post, which I proceeded to update.  And that gave me the idea of stooping to a classic blogospheric move in times of sparse content:  reposting old stuff!  So here is the post in question, from several years ago.  If people don’t complain too loudly, maybe we’ll dig up some more ancient blogging and bring it back to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics, as we all know, is weird.  It’s weird enough in its own right, but when some determined experimenters do tricks that really bring out the weirdness in all its glory, and the results are conveyed to us by well-intentioned but occasionally murky vulgarizations in the popular press, it can seem even weirder than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was a classic example:  &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060220/full/060220-10.html"&gt;the computer that could figure out the answer without actually doing a calculation&lt;/a&gt;!  (See &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/02/you_cant_get_there_from_here_1.php"&gt;Uncertain Principles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2006/02/24/if-zephod-beeblebrox-shows-up-at-the-university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-and-makes-off-with-the-interferometers-dont-say-i-didnt-warn-you/"&gt;Crooked Timber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/2006/02/more_on_the_uni.html"&gt;3 Quarks Daily&lt;/a&gt;.)  The articles refer to an experiment performed by Onur Hosten and collaborators in &lt;a href="http://physics.illinois.edu/people/profile.asp?kwiat"&gt;Paul Kwiat&lt;/a&gt;’s group at Urbana-Champaign, involving an ingenious series of quantum-mechanical miracles.  On the surface, these results seem nearly impossible to make sense of.  (Indeed, &lt;a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/02/i_dont_understa.html"&gt;Brad DeLong&lt;/a&gt; has nearly given up hope.)  How can you get an answer without doing a calculation?  Half of the problem is that imprecise language makes the experiment seem even more fantastical than it really is — the other half is that it really is quite astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me make a stab at explaining, perhaps not the entire exercise in quantum computation, but at least the most surprising part of the whole story — how you can detect something without actually looking at it.  The substance of everything that I will say is simply a translation of the nice explanation of &lt;a href="http://physics.illinois.edu/people/kwiat/interaction-free-measurements.asp"&gt;quantum interrogation&lt;/a&gt; at Kwiat’s page, with the exception that I will forgo the typically violent metaphors of blowing up bombs and killing cats in favor of a discussion of cute little puppies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.livingwilderness.com/odds/dogbox.html"&gt;&lt;img width="250" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/uploads/dogbox.jpg" alt="Puppy in a box"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  So here is our problem:  a large box lies before us, and we would like to know whether there is a sleeping puppy inside.  Except that, sensitive souls that we are, it’s really important that we don’t wake up the puppy.  Furthermore, due to circumstances too complicated to get into right now, we only have one technique at our disposal:  the ability to pass an item of food into a small flap in the box.  If the food is something uninteresting to puppies, like a salad, we will get no reaction — the puppy will just keep slumbering peacefully, oblivious to the food.  But if the food is something delicious (from the canine point of view), like a nice juicy steak, the aromas will awaken the puppy, which will begin to bark like mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem that we are stuck.  If we stick a salad into the box, we don’t learn anything, as from the outside we can’t tell the difference between a sleeping puppy and no puppy at all.  If we stick a steak into the box, we will definitely learn whether there is a puppy in there, but only because it will wake up and start barking if it’s there, and that would break our over-sensitive hearts.  Puppies need their sleep, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, we are not only very considerate, we are also excellent experimental physicists with a keen grasp of quantum mechanics.  Quantum mechanics, according to the conventional interpretations that are good enough for our purposes here, says three crucial and amazing things.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, objects can exist in “superpositions” of the characteristics we can measure about them.  For example, if we have an item of food, according to old-fashioned classical mechanics it could perhaps be “salad” or “steak.”  But according to quantum mechanics, the true state of the food could be a combination, known as a &lt;em&gt;wavefunction&lt;/em&gt;, which takes the form  (food) = &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(salad) + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;(steak), where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; are some numerical coefficients.  That is not to say (as you might get the impression) that we are not sure whether the food is salad or steak; rather, it really is a simultaneous superposition of both possibilities.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second amazing thing is that we can never &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; the food to be in such a superposition; whenever we (or sleeping puppies) observe the food, we always find that it appears to be either salad or steak.  (Eigenstates of the food operator, for you experts.)  The numerical coefficients &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; tell us the probability of measuring either alternative; the chance we will observe salad is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the chance we will observe steak is &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  (Obviously, then, we must have &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, since the total probability must add up to one [at least, in a world in which the only kinds of food are salad and steak, which we are assuming for simplicity].)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third and finally, the act of observing the food changes its state once and for all, to be &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; whatever we have observed it to be.  If we look and it’s salad, the state of the food item is henceforth (food) = (salad), while if we saw that it was steak we would have (food) = (steak).  That’s the “collapse of the wavefunction.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read all that again, it’s okay.  It contains everything important you need to know about quantum mechanics; the rest is just some equations to make it look like science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s put it to work to find some puppies without waking them up.    Imagine we have our morsel of food, and that we are able to manipulate its wavefunction; that is, we can do various operations on the state described by (food) = &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(salad) + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;(steak).  In particular, imagine that we can &lt;em&gt;rotate&lt;/em&gt; that wavefunction, without actually observing it.  In using this language, we are thinking of the state of the food as a vector in a two-dimensional space, whose axes are labeled (salad) and (steak).  The components of the vector are just (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;). And then “rotate” just means what it sounds like:  rotate that vector in its two-dimensional space.  A rotation by ninety degrees, for example, turns (salad) into (steak), and (steak) into -(salad); that minus sign is really there, but doesn’t affect the probabilities, since they are given by the square of the coefficients.  This operation of rotating the food vector without observing it is perfectly legitimate, since, if we didn’t know the state beforehand, we still don’t know it afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens?  Start with some food in the (salad) state.  Stick it into the box; whether there is a puppy inside or not, no barking ensues, as puppies wouldn’t be interested in salad anyway.  Now rotate the state by ninety degrees, converting it into the (steak) state.  We stick it into the box again; the puppy, unfortunately, observes the steak (by smelling it, most likely) and starts barking.  Okay, that didn’t do us much good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now imagine starting with the food in the (salad) state, and rotating it by 45 degrees instead of ninety degrees.  We are then in an equal superposition, (food) = &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(salad) + &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;(steak), with &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; given by one over the square root of two (about 0.71).  If we were to observe it (which we won’t), there would be a 50% chance (i.e., [one over the square root of two]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) that we would see salad, and a 50% chance that we would see steak.  Now stick it into the box — what happens?  If there is no puppy in there, nothing happens.  If there is a puppy, we have a 50% chance that the puppy thinks it’s salad and stays asleep, and a 50% chance that the puppy thinks it’s steak and starts barking.  Either way, the puppy has observed the food, and collapsed the wavefunction into either purely (salad) or purely (steak).  So, if we don’t hear any barking, &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; there’s no puppy and the state is still in a 45-degree superposition, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; there is a puppy in there and the food is in the pure (salad) state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that we didn’t hear any barking.  Next, carefully, without observing the food ourselves, take it out of the box and rotate the state by another 45 degrees.  If there were no puppy in the box, all that we’ve done is two consecutive rotations by 45 degrees, which is simply a single rotation by 90 degrees; we’ve turned a pure (salad) state into a pure (steak) state.  But if there is a puppy in there, and we didn’t hear it bark, the state that emerged from the box was not a superposition, but a pure (salad) state.  Our rotation therefore turns it back into the state (food) = 0.71(salad) + 0.71(steak).  And now we observe it ourselves.  If there were no puppy in the box, after all that manipulation we have a pure (steak) state, and we observe the food to be steak with probability one.  But if there is a puppy inside, even in the case that we didn’t hear it bark, our final observation has a (0.71)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.5 chance of finding that the food is salad!  So, if we happen to go through all that work and measure the food to be salad at the end of our procedure, we can be sure there is a puppy inside the box, even though we didn’t disturb it!  The &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; of the puppy affected the state, even though we didn’t (in this branch of the wavefunction, where the puppy didn’t start barking) actually interact with the puppy at all.  That’s “non-destructive quantum measurement,” and it’s the truly amazing part of this whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets better.  Note that, if there were a puppy in the box in the above story, there was a 50% chance that it would start barking, despite our wishes not to disturb it.  Is there any way to detect the puppy, without worrying that we might wake it up?  You know there is. Start with the food again in the (salad) state.  Now rotate it by just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; degree, rather than by 45 degrees.  That leaves the food in a state (food) = 0.999(salad) + 0.017(steak).  [Because &lt;em&gt;cos&lt;/em&gt;(1 degree) = 0.999 and &lt;em&gt;sin&lt;/em&gt;(1 degree) = 0.017, if you must know.]  Stick the food into the box.  The chance that the puppy smells steak and starts barking is 0.017&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0003, a tiny number indeed.  Now pull the food out, and rotate the state by another 1 degree without observing it.  Stick back into the box, and repeat 90 times.  If there is no puppy in there, we’ve just done a rotation by 90 degrees, and the food ends up in the purely (steak) state.  If there is a puppy in there, we must accept that there is some chance of waking it up — but it’s only 90*0.0003, which is less than three percent!  Meanwhile, if there is a puppy in there and it doesn’t bark, when we observe the final state there is a better than 97% chance that we will measure it to be (salad) — a sure sign there is a puppy inside!  Thus, we have about a 95% chance of knowing for sure that there is a puppy in there, without waking it up.  It’s obvious enough that this procedure can, in principle, be improved as much as we like, by rotating the state by arbitrarily tiny intervals and sticking the food into the box a correspondingly large number of times.  This is the “quantum Zeno effect,” named after a Greek philosopher who had little idea the trouble he was causing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, through the miracle of quantum mechanics, we can detect whether there is a puppy in the box, even though we never disturb its state.  Of course there is always some probability that we do wake it up, but by being careful we can make that probability as small as we like.  We’ve taken profound advantage of the most mysterious features of quantum mechanics — superposition and collapse of the wavefunction.  In a real sense, quantum mechanics allows us to arrange a system in which the &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; of some feature — in our case, the puppy in the box — affects the evolution of the wavefunction, even if we don’t directly &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; (or disturb) that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we simply replace “there is a puppy in the box” with “the result of the desired calculation is &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;.”  In other words, we arrange an experiment so that the final quantum state will look a certain way if the calculation has a certain answer, even if we don’t technically “do” the calculation.  That’s all there is to it, really — if I may blithely pass over the heroic efforts of some extremely talented experimenters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics is the coolest thing ever invented, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

In chemistry, this behavior - in electrons - leads to the periodic table: different elements behave in different ways chemically because of the number of electrons they have. More precisely, what matters is the number of electrons outside of a closed shell. I&amp;#39;ll explain what this means.One can (albeit simply) view the electrons of an atom as orbiting the nucleus, and the energy of the electrons are determined by the orbital in which they reside. Electrons can change orbitals, if the precise amount of energy necessary to &amp;quot;jump&amp;quot; from one orbital to another is put into the system (or carried out of the system). And because of the intrinsic nature of electrons (and all nucleons), only so many of them can be in a given orbital at once. As soon as the orbital, or &amp;quot;shell,&amp;quot; is full, it&amp;#39;s referred to as a &amp;quot;closed shell.&amp;quot; The electrons in the last shell (which is typically not full) are known as valence electrons.Interestingly, the nucleons (protons and neutrons) inside the nucleus of an atom behave in a similar way. They also pack into shells, with discrete energy differences in between. The study of this behavior has elucidated many variations on the simple theme, but one thing which continues to be of interest is the location of the &amp;quot;shell closures&amp;quot; - these locations being indicated by magic numbers. Once a magic number of nucleons (a magic number of protons, or neutrons, or both) is attained, like in the ultra-stable nucleus 208Pb, the nucleus behaves in a different way. It&amp;#39;s like the &amp;quot;noble gases&amp;quot; in chemistry - helium, neon, argon, etc - which are much more stable and inert than other elements, because they have closed electron shells (in other words, magic numbers of electrons).So the search was on for other nuclei that might be just like lead-208 because of their &amp;quot;magicity&amp;quot; (that&amp;#39;s a great term, isn&amp;#39;t it?). In essence, nuclear physicists wanted to find other nuclei that behave as almost perfectly magic due to their internal structure. It just so happens that tin-132, an isotope of tin with 50 protons and 82 neutrons (both magic numbers, making 132Sn &amp;quot;doubly magic&amp;quot;), is one such nucleus. And Dr. Jones and her collaborators proved it (the Editor&amp;#39;s Summary can be read for free on the Nature webpage here).By looking one nucleon away from the doubly-magic tin isotope, at tin-133, the collaboration was able to show that the tin-133 behaved essentially like a single particle - in other words, the single nucleon outside of the closed shell of tin-132 completely dictated the behavior of the entire nucleus. That means the tin-132 &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; was as inert as it could be, precisely what you expect from a doubly-magic nucleus.Dr. Jones and her collaborators performed the ground-breaking work at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. And it couldn&amp;#39;t have been done anywhere else. I know, because I was there. &amp;quot;Magical&amp;quot; results like this (if you&amp;#39;ll excuse the pun) don&amp;#39;t come easily; it takes years of work. But the reward - finding another nucleus which demonstrates so clearly the successes of the nuclear shell model - was well worth the wait.Reference:Jones, K., Adekola, A., Bardayan, D., Blackmon, J., Chae, K., Chipps, K., Cizewski, J., Erikson, L., Harlin, C., Hatarik, R., Kapler, R., Kozub, R., Liang, J., Livesay, R., Ma, Z., Moazen, B., Nesaraja, C., Nunes, F., Pain, S., Patterson, N., Shapira, D., Shriner, J., Smith, M., Swan, T., &amp;amp; Thomas, J.

&lt;p&gt;What they really want to know is why do I want to make art and jewelry based on something as dull and stuffy as nose in a textbook, eyeball in a microscope, science? I realize that what I make is slightly unusual in the grand scheme of things but in my opinion there is nothing dull or stuffy about science at all and any people who think that way probably haven’t had a chance to take a closer look. In fact, science and art have had a groping, passionate, rip-your-clothes-off love affair throughout the ages and will continue to play with and upon one another until this wacky human animal ceases to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts and the sciences both utilize the same creative energy source to propel them into the future and to cement their ideas into the collective culture. Both do an interpretive dance along the precipice of possibilities. Science and art both reach into the subconscious and bring back the awe-inspiring ideas of tomorrow. Both fail miserably and both desperately try again. Both disciplines have a desire to understand and a desire to communicate. Both build upon empirical knowledge by flipping information on its head and investigating from all directions and both find what is new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative minds work not only on the masterpieces in literature, in paint, in dance, theatre, and song, but also in the labs across the world.  As long as there are students manipulating &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90014997"&gt;e coli so that it smells like bananas and mint&lt;/a&gt; and as long as there are far away worlds and life forms yet to discover and diseases to cure and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10134341.stm"&gt;synthetic life&lt;/a&gt; and robotic friends to create and fossils to discover, there will be inspired artists playing with similar ideas throughout the lands. And as long as there are science fiction writers and futuristic cartoonists there will be inspired scientists and engineers as well. We are after all, in this together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of a happy coexistence of art and craft and science and innovation took place this past weekend at the &lt;a href="http://makerfaire.com/media/"&gt;Bay Area Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;img src="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/2482/makerrobot.jpg" alt="little robot" width="320" height="266"&gt;There were artists, crafters, inventors, engineers and scientists all packed into an awe inspiring faire the likes of which I had never seen. I had my Surly-Ramics &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/surly?section_id=5265740"&gt;Smart Jewelry&lt;/a&gt; on display and so I couldn’t get out and about too much but I did manage to bring back some fun morsels that I hope will inspire you to understand why I truly love both science and art.&lt;/p&gt;

 Here is a just a tiny sample of fun and inspiring things I was lucky enough to see at the Bay Area Maker Faire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DUDE! There was a commercial spacecraft there! A SPACECRAFT!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4672/spacecraft.jpg" alt="spacecraft"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Morris Jarvis from &lt;a href="http://www.starsystemsinc.net/swfs/shell.htm"&gt;Star Systems INC.&lt;/a&gt; created a full scale prototype of a commercial spacecraft named, HERMES. The goal of the project is to create more reasonably priced spaceflight to private citizens. Awesome.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/2861/spacecraftinfo.jpg" alt="spacecraft info"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were solar powered fireflies!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.humbleearthproductions.com/images/Firefly_Fall_Foilage-200px_feather.jpg" alt="fireflies"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Humble Earth Productions created little solar powered fireflies that will live in the backyards of us city folk who don’t have any real ones of our own! They flicker for about two hours after the sun sets, just like the real fellas. So cool! &lt;a href="http://www.humbleearthproductions.com/products.htm"&gt;Click here to learn more and to see them in action!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were crocheted cephalopods!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9572/crochetcephelopods.jpg" alt="cephalopods"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And dancing flames! (both by &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/skeletaldropkick"&gt;Skeletal Dropkick&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img248.imageshack.us/img248/9483/flamex.jpg" alt="dancing flame"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.ponoko.com/2010/01/28/vambit-designer-toy/"&gt;VAMBIT&lt;/a&gt;, a designer toy company let us build our own robots!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img295.imageshack.us/img295/8906/littlebots.jpg" alt="lil robots"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were super-soft ADORABLE fuzzy monster bags that would gobble up your cellphone and hold it till you needed it later. Handcrafted by &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/abbydid"&gt;Abby Did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
She has lots of other plush monsters you just can’t help but LOVE!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Savage was there. He gave a talk on problem solving. (Spoiler for TAM8? We will have to wait and see!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and of course I was there too!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had all my science and secular humanism and atheist designs on display.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the 70,000 or so attendees were extremely supportive and pleased with my work.&lt;br&gt;

One person got upset and asked why my art was so anti-religion. I responded that it wasn’t anti-religion. It was pro-reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other person got mad at a pendant that says, “science saves lives.” She told my assistant that science doesn’t save lives because it allows for abortions. Sigh. Sadly, I did not hear the comment so I could not respond but in a sense I did respond in a quieter gentler and more humanitarian way. I donated $250 of the money I made from selling &lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/surly"&gt;Surlies&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend to, &lt;a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"&gt;Doctors Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Our bloated, industry-driven system manages to deliver less effective care at a higher cost than most other industrialized nations.  The system is Byzantine, unnavigable, and dangerous, and is kept that way in the name of the Holy Market. But health care can benefit from practices that are decidedly un-capitalist, at least in the Milton Friendman or Ron Paul sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like aviation, health care must apply risky and expensive practices to large numbers of people in dangerous situations. This process is made safer by certain sorts of standardization, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/02/keeping_em_alive.php"&gt;such as checklists.&lt;/a&gt;  Data suggest we would also benefit from developing widely applied, evidence-based best practice guidelines, and from increasing the use and interoperability of electronic health systems.  But that's not how we do things here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our culture is strongly biased against centralized &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, which is often a useful instinct.   But in health care, the market does not necessarily drive &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; practices, but &lt;i&gt;most profitable &lt;/i&gt;ones.  One of the worst hybrids of the ultra-free market ideal and the more communitarian ideal is the HMO.  It's not that the idea is inherently bad, but its implementation has often been problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An HMO is an agreement between a patient, a physician, and an HMO.  The patient pays a premium to the HMO, and co-pays to doctors and other providers.  These fees are usually significantly lower than in other types of plans.  The HMO assigns them to a primary care physician and agrees to pay for care the PCP recommends, within the guidelines of the plan.  This puts the PCP in the position of &amp;quot;gatekeeper&amp;quot; for more complex medical care.  The doctor is often payed less to care for HMO patients, but in exchange the HMO sends them patients and keeps them busy. But this system is often a loss for both the doctor and the patient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common way doctors get paid by HMOs is "capitation", that is, getting paid per head.  An HMO will offer a doctor&lt;em&gt; x &lt;/em&gt;dollars per month per patient.  This reduces the incentive for the doctor to provide unnecessary but potentially profitable care.  In fact the incentive is exactly the opposite: the more patients the doctor enrolls, and the fewer services she provides, the more she and the HMO will profit.  Basically, HMOs are designed (in their classic form) to give the appearance of providing efficient low cost care, while actually providing inefficient, low cost care that can be minimalist at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;Many of my colleagues argue that a single-payer system would amplify this effect, as the government, acting as the insurer, would basically enroll us all in a giant HMO.  The actual government approach to care is more complex.  The VA is a model of a centralized, self-contained, single-payer system.  Medicare functions as more of an open single payer system where patients can choose where to get their care.  And Medicaid tends to be a mix of government-administered plans and plans run through private HMOs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;I had a hard time digging up statistics, but as of about ten years ago about 60 million Americans were enrolled in HMOs. Government agencies such as those listed above often contract with HMOs run by the private sector. TRICARE, the plan for military personnel and dependents, offers many different plans, but give strong incentives to use their HMO, TRICARE Prime.  TRICARE Prime is offered by the government, but run by a private company, so it cannot be accused of being &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot;. But it can be accused of being insane.  Like most HMOs, it requires enrollees (i.e., people) to select a primary care physician and to get most care approved by that physician.  But what happens when that&amp;#39;s not possible?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal"&gt;A reader sends me the following (names have been changed, etc. and all emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:20px;border-top-width:0px;border-right-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px;border-style:initial;border-color:initial;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:1em;font-weight:normal;background-repeat:no-repeat repeat"&gt;Is it ethical or not for a primary care physician to make a referral for a patient he/she has never seen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Background: &lt;br&gt;Recently I found myself out of town at the same time I was between PCPs. My original PCP was at a facility that was closed with less than a week's notice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly thereafter, I finally found a civilian physician willing to take a Tricare Prime patient and faxed the papers to Tricare. I was told that any request received before the 20th of the month would take effect on the 1st of the next month... if approved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During this window period, I developed stomach pain and a fever. The next day I tried to get a referral from my insurance for a visit to an urgent care clinic. I was told this could not happen without a referral from my PCP. At the time, I thought I did not have one, but was informed that my new PCP became effective upon receipt of the fax -- April 17.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My new PCP refused to give a referral, as I expected &lt;b&gt;because she'd never seen me.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway... I went to an ER &lt;b&gt;(no referral required)&lt;/b&gt; and was admitted for surgery for [a life-threatening surgical condition]. The surgeon questioned me about the surroundings I&amp;#39;d be released to after surgery&lt;b&gt; and recommended certain home health accommodations.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since&lt;b&gt; home health also required a PCP referral,&lt;/b&gt; I paid for them out-of-pocket. I won&amp;#39;t try to get reimbursed for these services because they really were minimal, but I&amp;#39;m quite angry about the whole thing. At one point, a Tricare Prime representative told me that I would also have to pay out of pocket for the follow-up appt. with the surgeon. The surgeon&amp;#39;s office subsequently assured me that was covered under his fee for the surgery... but it still made me angry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems to me that IF a PCP is required for referrals, that Tricare Prime cannot allow a situation to occur where one would be without a PCP and that they cannot require a physician to act unethically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's why I would like an unbiased view of the ethics of a physician signing off on a referral without ever having seen the patient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read my email.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fascinating.  And not atypical.  It seems that even the HMO employee didn&amp;#39;t understand all of the intricacies (such as the surgeon&amp;#39;s fee covering follow up appointments).  It wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if some of the services she needed were actually covered.  But that wasn&amp;#39;t her question.  She was very tolerant of her HMO, and has a question about ethics.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A doctor who took care of her for a serious condition recommended a particular treatment in order to safely leave the hospital (home care).  The HMO required (per her report) that the PCP (who had yet to meet her) order the care that the surgeon required of her.  But she did not have a chance to see her PCP before becoming gravely ill.  Should the PCP have just gone ahead and ordered the service?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As with most ethical questions, it depends.  If a physician orders a service and assumes the care of a patient, they must document this care.  For home care, a physician must order the services and evaluate the progress periodically.  My patients receive home care all the time.  Usually, I order it on discharge from the hospital, but sometimes directly to the home.  I must send in an order for services with a diagnosis, and must sign off on updates indicating that I know what&amp;#39;s going on and approve of it.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The general principle is that a doctor should not treat a patient they don&amp;#39;t know.  How can the patient&amp;#39;s PCP sign off on care without even knowing what the patient does or does not need?  Is it even legal to order home care without evaluating the patient and documenting this evaluation?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether it&amp;#39;s legal or not, it&amp;#39;s unwise.  I don&amp;#39;t think it would be ethical to order services for someone who I, or a clinician I am supervising, has not personally evaluated.  But what about other ethical principles such as beneficence and nonmaleficence?  If I, as the HMO doctor, have been assigned to care for a patient, don&amp;#39;t I have ethical responsibilities to them?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes, but they are limited.  Nonmaleficence includes withholding services that are unnecessary.  It requires that I make sure that care I order is appropriate.  The entire SNAFU detailed in the above letter is a nightmare for the patient and the doctors.  The surgeon needs to provide a covered service but cannot.  The primary care physician presumably wants the best for all her patients, not just the one&amp;#39;s she knows, but her hands are effectively tied.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is, in short, not a problem of individual ethics, but of societal ethics.  When we create insane barriers to proper health care, we have made a societal decision that we don&amp;#39;t value the health of our citizens.   We may all have different ideas on how to solve this problem, but anyone who thinks this is normal or sane gets a stern wag of the finger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/E-mlekN5b_E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274911234334"><id gr:original-id="http://www.lucasbrouwers.nl/blog/2010/05/graffiti-and-poetry-in-a-synthetic-genome/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c44e102b5cf8002</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Graffiti and Poetry in a Synthetic Genome</title><published>2010-05-26T13:20:01Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T13:20:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/6Nmj8uwBj3A/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.lucasbrouwers.nl/blog/2010/05/graffiti-and-poetry-in-a-synthetic-genome/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Last week, the world learned of the first living organism that carries a synthetic genome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010875" title=""&gt;A New Pterosaur (Pterodactyloidea: Azhdarchidae) from the Upper Cretaceous of Morocco&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kem Kem beds in South Eastern Morocco contain a rich early Upper (or possibly late Lower) Cretaceous vertebrate assemblage. Fragmentary remains, predominantly teeth and jaw tips, represent several kinds of pterosaur although only one species, the ornithocheirid Coloborhynchus moroccensis, has been named. Here, we describe a new azhdarchid pterosaur, Alanqa saharica nov. gen. nov. sp., based on an almost complete well preserved mandibular symphysis from Aferdou N'Chaft. We assign additional fragmentary jaw remains, some of which have been tentatively identified as azhdarchid and pteranodontid, to this new taxon which is distinguished from other azhdarchids by a remarkably straight, elongate, lance-shaped mandibular symphysis that bears a pronounced dorsal eminence near the posterior end of its dorsal (occlusal) surface. Most remains, including the holotype, represent individuals of approximately three to four meters in wingspan, but a fragment of a large cervical vertebra, that probably also belongs to A. saharica, suggests that wingspans of six meters were achieved in this species. The Kem Kem beds have yielded the most diverse pterosaur assemblage yet reported from Africa and provide the first clear evidence for the presence of azhdarchids in Gondwana at the start of the Late Cretaceous. This, the relatively large size achieved by Alanqa, and the additional evidence of variable jaw morphology in azhdarchids provided by this taxon, indicates a longer and more complex history for this clade than previously suspected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010738" title=""&gt;Large-Range Movements of Neotropical Orchid Bees Observed via Radio Telemetry&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) are often cited as classic examples of trapline-foragers with potentially extensive foraging ranges. If long-distance movements are habitual, rare plants in widely scattered locations may benefit from euglossine pollination services. Here we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment. Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42-115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods, between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010784" title=""&gt;Helper Response to Experimentally Manipulated Predation Risk in the Cooperatively Breeding Cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We manipulated predation risk in a field experiment with the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher by releasing no predator, a medium- or a large-sized fish predator inside underwater cages enclosing two to three natural groups. We assessed whether helpers changed their helping behaviour, and whether within-group conflict changed, depending on these treatments, testing three hypotheses: 'pay-to-stay' PS, 'risk avoidance' RA, or (future) reproductive benefits RB. We also assessed whether helper food intake was reduced under risk, because this might reduce investments in other behaviours to save energy. Medium and large helpers fed less under predation risk. Despite this effect helpers invested more in territory defence, but not territory maintenance, under the risk of predation (supporting PS). Experimentally covering only the breeding shelter with sand induced more helper digging under predation risk compared to the control treatment (supporting PS). Aggression towards the introduced predator did not differ between the two predator treatments and increased with group member size and group size (supporting PS and RA). Large helpers increased their help ratio (helping effort/breeder aggression received, 'punishment' by the dominant pair in the group) in the predation treatments compared to the control treatment, suggesting they were more willing to PS. Medium helpers did not show such effects. Large helpers also showed a higher submission ratio (submission/ breeder aggression received) in all treatments, compared to the medium helpers (supporting PS). We conclude that predation risk reduces helper food intake, but despite this effect, helpers were more willing to support the breeders, supporting PS. Effects of breeder punishment suggests that PS might be more important for large compared to the medium helpers. Evidence for RA was also detected. Finally, the results were inconsistent with RB.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010782" title=""&gt;The Promise and Perils of Pre-Publication Review: A Multi-Agent Simulation of Biomedical Discovery Under Varying Levels of Review Stringency&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Internet has enabled profound changes in the way science is performed, especially in scientific communications. Among the most important of these changes is the possibility of new models for pre-publication review, ranging from the current, relatively strict peer-review model, to entirely unreviewed, instant self-publication. Different models may affect scientific progress by altering both the quality and quantity of papers available to the research community. To test how models affect the community, I used a multi-agent simulation of treatment selection and outcome in a patient population to examine how various levels of pre-publication review might affect the rate of scientific progress. I identified a "sweet spot" between the points of very limited and very strict requirements for pre-publication review. The model also produced a u-shaped curve where very limited review requirement was slightly superior to a moderate level of requirement, but not as large as the aforementioned sweet spot. This unexpected phenomenon appears to result from the community taking longer to discover the correct treatment with more strict pre-publication review. In the parameter regimens I explored, both completely unreviewed and very strictly reviewed scientific communication seems likely to hinder scientific progress. Much more investigation is warranted. Multi-agent simulations can help to shed light on complex questions of scientific communication and exhibit interesting, unexpected behaviors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010613" title=""&gt;Recurrent, Robust and Scalable Patterns Underlie Human Approach and Avoidance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Approach and avoidance behavior provide a means for assessing the rewarding or aversive value of stimuli, and can be quantified by a keypress procedure whereby subjects work to increase (approach), decrease (avoid), or do nothing about time of exposure to a rewarding/aversive stimulus. To investigate whether approach/avoidance behavior might be governed by quantitative principles that meet engineering criteria for lawfulness and that encode known features of reward/aversion function, we evaluated whether keypress responses toward pictures with potential motivational value produced any regular patterns, such as a trade-off between approach and avoidance, or recurrent lawful patterns as observed with prospect theory. Three sets of experiments employed this task with beautiful face images, a standardized set of affective photographs, and pictures of food during controlled states of hunger and satiety. An iterative modeling approach to data identified multiple law-like patterns, based on variables grounded in the individual. These patterns were consistent across stimulus types, robust to noise, describable by a simple power law, and scalable between individuals and groups. Patterns included: (i) a preference trade-off counterbalancing approach and avoidance, (ii) a value function linking preference intensity to uncertainty about preference, and (iii) a saturation function linking preference intensity to its standard deviation, thereby setting limits to both. These law-like patterns were compatible with critical features of prospect theory, the matching law, and alliesthesia. Furthermore, they appeared consistent with both mean-variance and expected utility approaches to the assessment of risk. Ordering of responses across categories of stimuli demonstrated three properties thought to be relevant for preference-based choice, suggesting these patterns might be grouped together as a relative preference theory. Since variables in these patterns have been associated with reward circuitry structure and function, they may provide a method for quantitative phenotyping of normative and pathological function (e.g., psychiatric illness).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010816" title=""&gt;Coevolution in Action: Disruptive Selection on Egg Colour in an Avian Brood Parasite and Its Host&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Trait polymorphism can evolve as a consequence of frequency-dependent selection. Coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites may lead to selection on both to evolve extreme phenotypes deviating from the norm, through disruptive selection. Here, we show through detailed field studies and experimental procedures that the ashy-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) and its avian brood parasite, the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), have both evolved egg polymorphism manifested in discrete immaculate white, pale blue, and blue egg phenotypes within a single population. In this host-parasite system the most common egg colours were white and blue, with no significant difference in parasitism rates between hosts laying eggs of either colour. Furthermore, selection on parasites for countering the evolution of host egg types appears to be strong, since ashy-throated parrotbills have evolved rejection abilities for even partially mimetic eggs. The parrotbill-cuckoo system constitutes a clear outcome of disruptive selection on both host and parasite egg phenotypes driven by coevolution, due to the cost of parasitism in the host and by host defences in the parasite. The present study is to our knowledge the first to report the influence of disruptive selection on evolution of discrete phenotypes in both parasite and host traits in an avian brood parasitism system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010824" title=""&gt;The Effects of Nutrient Dynamics on Root Patch Choice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Plants have been recognized to be capable of allocating more roots to rich patches in the soil. We tested the hypothesis that in addition to their sensitivity to absolute differences in nutrient availability, plants are also responsive to temporal changes in nutrient availability. Different roots of the same Pisum sativum plants were subjected to variable homogeneous and heterogeneous temporally - dynamic and static nutrient regimes. When given a choice, plants not only developed greater root biomasses in richer patches; they discriminately allocated more resources to roots that developed in patches with increasing nutrient levels, even when their other roots developed in richer patches. These results suggest that plants are able to perceive and respond to dynamic environmental changes. This ability might enable plants to increase their performance by responding to both current and anticipated resource availabilities in their immediate proximity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010831" title=""&gt;Bacterial Gut Symbionts Contribute to Seed Digestion in an Omnivorous Beetle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obligate bacterial symbionts alter the diets of host animals in numerous ways, but the ecological roles of facultative bacterial residents that colonize insect guts remain unclear. Carabid beetles are a common group of beneficial insects appreciated for their ability to consume insect prey and seeds, but the contributions of microbes to diet diversification in this and similar groups of facultative granivores are largely unknown. Using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and terminal restriction fragment (tRF) length polymorphism analyses of these genes, we examined the bacterial communities within the guts of facultatively granivorous, adult Harpalus pensylvanicus (Carabidae), fed one of five dietary treatments: 1) an untreated Field population, 2) Seeds with antibiotics (seeds were from Chenopodium album), 3) Seeds without antibiotics, 4) Prey with antibiotics (prey were Acheta domesticus eggs), and 5) Prey without antibiotics. The number of seeds and prey consumed by each beetle were recorded following treatment. Harpalus pensylvanicus possessed a fairly simple gut community of approximately 3-4 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU) per beetle that were affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Alphaproteobacteria, and Mollicutes. Bacterial communities of the host varied among the diet and antibiotic treatments. The field population and beetles fed seeds without antibiotics had the closest matching bacterial communities, and the communities in the beetles fed antibiotics were more closely related to each other than to those of the beetles that did not receive antibiotics. Antibiotics reduced and altered the bacterial communities found in the beetle guts. Moreover, beetles fed antibiotics ate fewer seeds, and those beetles that harbored the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis consumed more seeds on average than those lacking this symbiont. We conclude that the relationships between the bacterium E. faecalis and this factultative granivore's ability to consume seeds merit further investigation, and that facultative associations with symbiotic bacteria have important implications for the nutritional ecology of their hosts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010833" title=""&gt;The Nature of Working Memory for Braille&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Blind individuals have been shown on multiple occasions to compensate for their loss of sight by developing exceptional abilities in their remaining senses. While most research has been focused on perceptual abilities per se in the auditory and tactile modalities, recent work has also investigated higher-order processes involving memory and language functions. Here we examined tactile working memory for Braille in two groups of visually challenged individuals (completely blind subjects, CBS; blind with residual vision, BRV). In a first experimental procedure both groups were given a Braille tactile memory span task with and without articulatory suppression, while the BRV and a sighted group performed a visual version of the task. It was shown that the Braille tactile working memory (BrWM) of CBS individuals under articulatory suppression is as efficient as that of sighted individuals' visual working memory in the same condition. Moreover, the results suggest that BrWM may be more robust in the CBS than in the BRV subjects, thus pointing to the potential role of visual experience in shaping tactile working memory. A second experiment designed to assess the nature (spatial vs. verbal) of this working memory was then carried out with two new CBS and BRV groups having to perform the Braille task concurrently with a mental arithmetic task or a mental displacement of blocks task. We show that the disruption of memory was greatest when concurrently carrying out the mental displacement of blocks, indicating that the Braille tactile subsystem of working memory is likely spatial in nature in CBS. The results also point to the multimodal nature of working memory and show how experience can shape the development of its subcomponents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010834" title=""&gt;Bacterial Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Relations Are Modified by Environmental Complexity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the recognition that environmental change resulting from anthropogenic activities is causing a global decline in biodiversity, much attention has been devoted to understanding how changes in biodiversity may alter levels of ecosystem functioning. Although environmental complexity has long been recognised as a major driving force in evolutionary processes, it has only recently been incorporated into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning investigations. Environmental complexity is expected to strengthen the positive effect of species richness on ecosystem functioning, mainly because it leads to stronger complementarity effects, such as resource partitioning and facilitative interactions among species when the number of available resource increases. Here we implemented an experiment to test the combined effect of species richness and environmental complexity, more specifically, resource richness on ecosystem functioning over time. We show, using all possible combinations of species within a bacterial community consisting of six species, and all possible combinations of three substrates, that diversity-functioning (metabolic activity) relationships change over time from linear to saturated. This was probably caused by a combination of limited complementarity effects and negative interactions among competing species as the experiment progressed. Even though species richness and resource richness both enhanced ecosystem functioning, they did so independently from each other. Instead there were complex interactions between particular species and substrate combinations. Our study shows clearly that both species richness and environmental complexity increase ecosystem functioning. The finding that there was no direct interaction between these two factors, but that instead rather complex interactions between combinations of certain species and resources underlie positive biodiversity ecosystem functioning relationships, suggests that detailed knowledge of how individual species interact with complex natural environments will be required in order to make reliable predictions about how altered levels of biodiversity will most likely affect ecosystem functioning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010835" title=""&gt;Changing Patterns of Microhabitat Utilization by the Threespot Damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, on Caribbean Reefs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The threespot damselfish, Stegastes planifrons (Cuvier), is important in mediating interactions among corals, algae, and herbivores on Caribbean coral reefs. The preferred microhabitat of S. planifrons  is thickets of the branching staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis.  Within the past few decades, mass mortality of A. cervicornis from white-band disease and other factors has rendered this coral a minor ecological component throughout most of its range. Survey data from Jamaica (heavily fished), Florida and the Bahamas (moderately fished), the Cayman Islands (lightly to moderately fished), and Belize (lightly fished) indicate that distributional patterns of S. planifrons are positively correlated with live coral cover and topographic complexity. Our results suggest that species-specific microhabitat preferences and the availability of topographically complex microhabitats are more important than the abundance of predatory fish as proximal controls on S. planifrons distribution and abundance. The loss of the primary microhabitat of S. planifrons--A. cervicornis--has forced a shift in the distribution and recruitment of these damselfish onto remaining high-structured corals, especially the Montastraea annularis species complex, affecting coral mortality and algal dynamics throughout the Caribbean.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010837" title=""&gt;The Power of Exercise: Buffering the Effect of Chronic Stress on Telomere Length&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chronic psychological stress is associated with detrimental effects on physical health, and may operate in part through accelerated cell aging, as indexed by shorter telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. However, not all people under stress have distinctly short telomeres, and we examined whether exercise can serve a stress-buffering function. We predicted that chronic stress would be related to short telomere length (TL) in sedentary individuals, whereas in those who exercise, stress would not have measurable effects on telomere shortening. 63 healthy post-menopausal women underwent a fasting morning blood draw for whole blood TL analysis by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983), and for three successive days reported daily minutes of vigorous activity. Participants were categorized into two groups-sedentary and active (those getting Centers for Disease Control-recommended daily amount of activity). The likelihood of having short versus long telomeres was calculated as a function of stress and exercise group, covarying age, BMI and education. Logistic regression analyses revealed a significant moderating effect of exercise. As predicted, among non-exercisers a one unit increase in the Perceived Stress Scale was related to a 15-fold increase in the odds of having short telomeres (p&amp;lt;.05), whereas in exercisers, perceived stress appears to be unrelated to TL (B = −.59, SE = .78, p = .45). Vigorous physical activity appears to protect those experiencing high stress by buffering its relationship with TL. We propose pathways through which physical activity acts to buffer stress effects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010839" title=""&gt;'Functional Connectivity' Is a Sensitive Predictor of Epilepsy Diagnosis after the First Seizure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although epilepsy affects almost 1% of the world population, diagnosis of this debilitating disease is still difficult. The EEG is an important tool for epilepsy diagnosis and classification, but the sensitivity of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on the first EEG is only 30-50%. Here we investigate whether using 'functional connectivity' can improve the diagnostic sensitivity of the first interictal EEG in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Patients were selected from a database with 390 standard EEGs of patients after a first suspected seizure. Patients who were later diagnosed with epilepsy (i.e. ≥two seizures) were compared to matched non-epilepsy patients (with a minimum follow-up of one year). The synchronization likelihood (SL) was used as an index of functional connectivity of the EEG, and average SL per patient was calculated in seven frequency bands. In total, 114 patients were selected. Fifty-seven patients were diagnosed with epilepsy (20 had IEDs on their EEG) and 57 matched patients had other diagnoses. Epilepsy patients had significantly higher SL in the theta band than non-epilepsy patients. Furthermore, theta band SL proved to be a significant predictor of a diagnosis of epilepsy. When only those epilepsy patients without IEDs were considered (n = 74), theta band SL could predict diagnosis with specificity of 76% and sensitivity of 62%. Theta band functional connectivity may be a useful diagnostic tool in diagnosing epilepsy, especially in those patients who do not show IEDs on their first EEG. Our results indicate that epilepsy diagnosis could be improved by using functional connectivity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010847" title=""&gt;The Brain Functional Networks Associated to Human and Animal Suffering Differ among Omnivores, Vegetarians and Vegans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Empathy and affective appraisals for conspecifics are among the hallmarks of social interaction. Using functional MRI, we hypothesized that vegetarians and vegans, who made their feeding choice for ethical reasons, might show brain responses to conditions of suffering involving humans or animals different from omnivores. We recruited 20 omnivore subjects, 19 vegetarians, and 21 vegans. The groups were matched for sex and age. Brain activation was investigated using fMRI and an event-related design during observation of negative affective pictures of human beings and animals (showing mutilations, murdered people, human/animal threat, tortures, wounds, etc.). Participants saw negative-valence scenes related to humans and animals, alternating with natural landscapes. During human negative valence scenes, compared with omnivores, vegetarians and vegans had an increased recruitment of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). More critically, during animal negative valence scenes, they had decreased amygdala activation and increased activation of the lingual gyri, the left cuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex and several areas mainly located in the frontal lobes, including the ACC, the IFG and the middle frontal gyrus. Nonetheless, also substantial differences between vegetarians and vegans have been found responding to negative scenes. Vegetarians showed a selective recruitment of the right inferior parietal lobule during human negative scenes, and a prevailing activation of the ACC during animal negative scenes. Conversely, during animal negative scenes an increased activation of the inferior prefrontal cortex was observed in vegans. These results suggest that empathy toward non conspecifics has different neural representation among individuals with different feeding habits, perhaps reflecting different motivational factors and beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_285.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ke8Z38IDxi4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274910460429"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=12588">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc92927969ea1ada</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Grayling on the Dalai Lama</title><published>2010-05-26T21:47:34Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T21:47:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/grayling-on-the-dalai-lama/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have this note from Anthony Grayling, which I post with his permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an op-ed in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/opinion/25gyatso.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=Many%20Faiths%20one%20truth&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;today’s New York Times&lt;/a&gt; by no less a personage than the Dalai Lama, headlined “Many Faiths, One Truth.” He is of course right: there are many faiths, and there is one truth: viz. that all the faiths are bunkum.  We all like the good old Dalai, do we not, who in this article iterates the claim that no-one heeds, viz., that tolerance is required for a peaceful world—except that he doesn’t seem to extend that warm sentiment to the limit. “Radical atheists issue blanket condemnations of those who hold to religious beliefs,” he laments, alongside mention of murderous inter-religious strife and religion-inspired mayhem—as if blanket condemnations‚ and mass murders carried out by zealots were somehow on a par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway: the point of mentioning this is to suggest that we never allow passage to the claim that the many faiths are all the same at bottom. The faithful hope that repetition of the claim will make it seem true.  In response we should endlessly iterate the obvious, that the religions are mutually exclusive, mutually blaspheming, mutually hostile,  bitterly and deeply divisive, and thus a rash of open sores in the flesh of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An equally bad thing about the Dalai Lama’s article is that he calls Buddhism a religion‚ and indeed in the superstitious demon-ridden polytheistic Tibetan version of it that he leads, that is what it is. But original Buddhism is a philosophy, without gods or supernatural beings—all such explicitly rejected by Siddhartha Gautama in offering a quietist ethical teaching; but he has of course been subjected to the Brian’s Sandal phenomenon in the usual stupid way of time and the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news that retinyl palmitate, a form of Vitamin A found in some sun screens, could actually accelerate the growth of skin &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/tag/cancer/?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_term=cancer&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internal_linking"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; has us wondering just what we can safely slather on our faces to protect them from the sun. Just in time for summer, the &lt;a href="http://www.ewg.org/2010sunscreen/full-report/"&gt;Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt; issued a review of 500 sunscreens, and only found 39 to be worthy of recommendation. &lt;a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/natural-sunscreens-460608"&gt;The Daily Green&lt;/a&gt; narrowed down those 39 into 21 great natural sunscreens, all free of retinyl palmitate and oxybenzone, a compound that could disrupt your hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

Though most of us have learned to look for lead-free products, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warns that at least 20% of human lead exposure comes from plumbing, and often from our sink faucets. Part of the problem lies in old plumbing; prior to 1996, the lead content of faucets and plumbing wasn’t regulated. But even so-called “lead-free” faucets might be leaching lead into your water: Federal laws still allow “lead-free” labelled faucets to contain up to 4% lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead exposure causes everything from aggressive behavior and criminal activity to heart disease and nervous system disorders – and the risks are recognized by leading U.S. and world organizations, including The EPA, The American Heart Association, the Centers for Disease Control, the  United States, the World Health  Organization, and many more. The scary part of lead exposure is that once we accumulate lead in our blood stream, it never gets metabolized or excreted, so it stays in our bodies for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing old faucets with lead-free faucets helps reduce risk of lead exposure, but it’s also a good idea to take extra precautions with your drinking water. The EPA suggests letting cold water run for a few seconds before filling a glass, to allow water that’s been sitting in the pipes to cycle through. They also suggest never drinking hot water directly from the tap, as hot water is more likely to cause leaching from plumbing and faucets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pill is getting lots of attention for its 50th birthday in the U.S. (attention whore!), but we wonder: Is it as popular in the rest of the world? According to the Center for Disease Control, we’re not the only ones who prefer oral contraceptives: In the U.S., 16% of married women use the pill, compared to 29% of women in the U.K. and 40% in the Netherlands and France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in America do, however, use sterilization more often than  non-American women, according to a report from the Center for Disease  Control. While about 17% of women in the U.S. have been sterilized, less than 10% of women in other countries record sterilizations as their method of birth control. The trends are consistent among non-married women as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New birth control products like vaginal rings and skin patches are gaining popularity, but so far less than 2% of women use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) While it’s not due to antivaxxers, it’s still important: &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37275963/ns/health-infectious_diseases/"&gt;measles is making a comeback across the world&lt;/a&gt;. According to the article, the lack of funding is making vaccines hard to come by in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and measles is very opportunistic. With the antivaxxers still spreading their lies in America, Australia, and elsewhere, it’s all too easy for this awful disease to spread wildly anywhere it gets a toehold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) It’s a delicate task, talking about someone’s kid when it comes to autism and vaccinations. It’s a social minefield; you’re dealing with an innocent kid, but you’re also dealing with a parent who may be gravely misinformed and doing a lot of harm by spreading misinformation. Jenny McCarthy, though, put her son Evan front and center in the nonsense she spouts about autism, and is doing &lt;em&gt;considerable&lt;/em&gt; harm to the public health. &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2010/05/frontline-vaccines-jenny-mccarthy-boom-the-souls-gone-from-his-eyes.html"&gt;Skeptico has taken on her claims&lt;/a&gt;, and shows that her version of events seems to shape-shift according to her needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, more like great-great-many-times-great-aunt of all squid, but it's still a spectacular fossil. Behold the Cambrian mollusc, &lt;i&gt;Nectocaris pteryx&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of those confusing, uninterpretable Cambrian animals, represented by only one poorly preserved specimen. Now, &lt;i&gt;91&lt;/i&gt; new specimens have been dug up and interpreted, and it makes sense to call it a cephalopod. It has two camera eyes — not arthropod-like compound eyes — on stalks, an axial cavity containing paired gills like the mantles of modern cephalopods, and a flexible siphon opening into that cavity. There are also subtle similarities in the structure of the connective tissue in the lateral fins. Obviously, it has a pair of tentacles; no mouthparts have been preserved, but there are hints in the form of dark deposits between the tentacles, which may be all that&amp;#39;s left of the mouthparts — and are in the right place for a cephalopod ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still mysteries. There's no hint of a shell; previous theories had postulated a shelled common ancestor to squid, nautiloids, and ammonoids, but either this was a specialized branch that lost the shell, or modern cephalopod groups independently re-evolved the structure. It also has only two tentacles! Again, we don't know whether this was the ancestral condition, or whether &lt;i&gt;Nectocaris&lt;/i&gt; is the product of a derived fusion. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/squid_hox_genes.php"&gt;Known cephalopod Hox genes use a novel combinatorial scheme to encode arm identities&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess I wouldn't be too shocked if the eight- to ten-arm condition is a relatively recent (in geological terms!) innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About that great-aunt remark…here&amp;#39;s where their analysis places the Nectocarids, as a Cambrian side-branch of the group that led to the modern forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/05/mother_of_all_squid/nectocaris_phylo.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/05/mother_of_all_squid/nectocaris_phylo-thumb-450x188-49873.jpeg" width="450" height="188" alt="nectocaris_phylo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phylogenetic position of the nectocaridids.&lt;/b&gt; Arrows indicate the crown groups of 1, molluscs; 2, conchifera; 3, cephalopods. Stars represent the earliest record of mineralization in each lineage. Clade divergence times (dotted lines) are unconstrained. Early branches follow previous phylogeny.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the dotted lines everywhere — those are lineages that we haven&amp;#39;t found in the fossil record yet. &lt;i&gt;Nectocaris&lt;/i&gt; is small (about 4cm long) and softbodied, and it required excellent preservation for any trace of them to survive. Specimens from the beginning of the Cambrian, representative of the groups indicated by the red arrows at 1 and 2, would be wonderful to have…but they&amp;#39;re also going to be forms that wouldn&amp;#39;t have been ideal for fossilization. Clearly, we need to fund more paleontology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Yong has more to say at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/26/nectocaris-mystery-fossil-was-actually-a-500-million-year-old-squid-relative/"&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center;font-size:11px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/05/mother_of_all_squid/nectocaris_phylo.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/05/mother_of_all_squid/nectocaris_phylo-thumb-450x188-49873.jpeg" width="450" height="188" alt="nectocaris_phylo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phylogenetic position of the nectocaridids.&lt;/b&gt; Arrows indicate the crown groups of 1, molluscs; 2, conchifera; 3, cephalopods. Stars represent the earliest record of mineralization in each lineage. Clade divergence times (dotted lines) are unconstrained. Early branches follow previous phylogeny.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the dotted lines everywhere — those are lineages that we haven&amp;#39;t found in the fossil record yet. &lt;i&gt;Nectocaris&lt;/i&gt; is small (about 4cm long) and softbodied, and it required excellent preservation for any trace of them to survive. Specimens from the beginning of the Cambrian, representative of the groups indicated by the red arrows at 1 and 2, would be wonderful to have…but they&amp;#39;re also going to be forms that wouldn&amp;#39;t have been ideal for fossilization. Clearly, we need to fund more paleontology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Yong has more to say at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/26/nectocaris-mystery-fossil-was-actually-a-500-million-year-old-squid-relative/"&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said yes, but that I’d be staying relatively hands off while I snuggle with my new baby, sleep and pop Oxycontin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn’t happen. Instead I got angry. I chose not to sleep… because who am I kidding? I have a 6 day old baby who eats every hour during the night. Giving up sleep is like giving up hosting my birthday party on Skepchick Island this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I had planned on pre-scheduling this week’s rant because I was scheduled to have a baby today… but that baby showed up last week and ruined EVERYTHING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to inspire you to get your rants to me, I will give you something to get ranty about. Here is the live stream of the anti-vax rally that the Women Thinking Free volunteers are out protesting today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/uajamie"&gt;@UAJamie&lt;/a&gt; is live tweeting from Grant Park &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23antivaxrally"&gt;#antivaxrally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Winn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/opinions/view_subpage.php?pk_id=0000009507"&gt;Garriott v. Winn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and will decide the constitutionality of a program that diverts tax money into private-school scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This program allows donors a dollar-for-dollar reduction in state income taxes.  The reduction is good for contributions of up to $1,000 if made to certain non-profits organizations.  These non-profits collect the money and distribute them in the form of scholarships for students.  The law allows organizations to limit the scholarships they disperse in any fashion &lt;em&gt;including exclusively to religious schools&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, organizations linked to a certain religions give the majority of scholarships to schools tied to that religion. Upset, taxpayers sued.  (Another issue in these cases I’m not mentioning is taxpayer standing for lawsuits — usually there is none — but the unique circumstances are likely to allow it here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxpayer &lt;a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/school_law/2010/05/justices_to_weigh_arizona_tuit.html"&gt;plaintiffs stated&lt;/a&gt; — and the April 2009 Ninth Circuit opinion agreed — “that Arizona’s tax-credit funded scholarship program lacks religious neutrality and true private choice in making scholarships available to parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side, however, points out that individuals decide to which non-profits they donate.  Then those non-profits divvy up the money.  They argue the money is clean of any ‘state taint’ that would render it subject to the Establishment clause.  This view is consistent with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everson_v._Board_of_Education"&gt;Everson v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;, a 1947 case that upheld NJ’s travel reimbursement to parents of religious schools and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelman_v._Simmons-Harris"&gt;Zelman v. Simmons-Harris&lt;/a&gt; where a government voucher program was upheld despite the option for a religious school voucher.  The idea in both of these cases was that because the assistance goes to the children and not the church it is neutral toward religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict the program will be found constitutional.  As seasoned SCOTUS watchers know — for the Supreme Court office pool, always vote against the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit"&gt;9th Circuit’s&lt;/a&gt; winning side.  Furthermore, the weight of the existing Supreme Court precedent is behind the Court finding for the tax program’s constitutionality.  Even if the taxpayers are correct that “the Arizona program is neither based on financial or academic need … [and] instead, […] awards most of its scholarships to the children of middle-class and wealthy parents on the basis of religion,” the fact remains that it is individuals who choose where to donate and the state has no hand in who gets the funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I think will happen and I expect to be right just about exactly half the time. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you be upset to see your neighbor’s tax money going towards tuition at a religious school if you knew you could donate your own tax money to a non-profit with a history of creating scholarships for secular schools?&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of filling your trash can with non-biodegradable junk, check out our roundup of eco-friendly party supplies. The best part? They’re all $10 or under, so you don’t need to break the bank to save the earth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/updates.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/spacex_f9_statictest.jpg" alt="spacex_f9_statictest" title="spacex_f9_statictest" width="480" height="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an unabashed fan of &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/"&gt;Space X&lt;/a&gt;, one of many commercial companies building rockets to make access to space easier, more reliable, and less expensive. They have already shown themselves to be capable of putting rockets into space, and being resilient while doing so. The &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php"&gt;Falcon 9&lt;/a&gt; is the next in their series of rockets; this one capable of getting supplies to the Space Station, sending astronauts into orbit, and eventually, being able to put &lt;em&gt;a 20 ton payload&lt;/em&gt; into geosynchronous orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can keep up-to-date with what’s what on the &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/updates.php"&gt;Space X updates page&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be keeping a close watch on events as well. This is the future of space exploration, quite literally, and I’m very excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the latest in a series of pretty funny videos from Spitzer Science Center called &lt;a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/videos/irrelevant/"&gt;IRrelevant Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve had lots of great folks on them, including Felicia Day, Sean Astin, and Betty White! Awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this one, Amy Okuda (Tinkerballa from &lt;a href="http://www.watchtheguild.com/"&gt;The Guild&lt;/a&gt;) is the actor, and &lt;a href="http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2010/05/starship-spitzer-presents-the-best-of-bot-worlds.html"&gt;Wil voices the robot&lt;/a&gt; as well as a slightly more cheesy (not evil) version of himself. These are great videos, fun to watch, and also edumacational. I highly recommend them. Watch this one through all the way to the end…&lt;/p&gt;

The standard advice to abstain entirely during pregnancy is precautionary, not evidence-based.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5207"&gt;New Data on Cell Phones and Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (Steven Novella) The Interphone study of cell phone users found no clear association with brain tumors and one subgroup even appeared to show a protective effect. Current evidence shows that there is either no risk or possibly a very small long term risk that would have to be balanced against the convenience of cell phones.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5219"&gt;“Medical Voices” on vaccine: Brave, brave Sir Robin&lt;/a&gt; (David Gorski) Mark Crislip easily answered the “9 Questions that Stump Every Pro-Vaccine Advocate” challenge from the “Medical Voices” anti-vaccine site. Instead of acknowledging and responding to his debunking on their website, they demanded a public debate, a favorite ploy of cranks everywhere. SBM refuses to play their game. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5225"&gt;Naturopathy for allergies&lt;/a&gt; (Peter Lipson) Naturopathy is basically a collection of old fashioned medical superstitions presented under a veneer of highly speculative, quasi-scientific assertions.

Medicine has instituted evidence-based infection control measures that have saved many lives, and it is constantly self-assessing and trying to do better. There are no similar efforts in alternative medicine, which has never modified any of its practices to improve safety or efficacy. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5251"&gt;The story of Andrew Wakefield in pictures&lt;/a&gt; (David Gorski) A link to an exposé of Andrew Wakefield’s misdeeds in the vaccine/autism saga in the highly accessible form of a cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefbrandon@gmail.com (Harriet Hall, MD (The SkepDoc))</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274898503853"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/more_emotional_intelligence_mo_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ae85395fe02e327</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">More emotional intelligence = more orgasms</title><published>2010-05-26T19:10:35Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T19:10:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/izH7XWp3KqA/more_emotional_intelligence_mo_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/more_emotional_intelligence_mo_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;According to a study just coming out in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, "variations in emotional intelligence--the ability to identify and manage emotions of one's self and others--are associated with orgasmic frequency during intercourse and masturbation."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/more_emotional_intelligence_mo_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/05/more_emotional_intelligence_mo_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/izH7XWp3KqA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274897900941"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=24843">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3437957c4954a63d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Demographics"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">The Anti-Gay Christians Are Losing</title><published>2010-05-26T17:00:33Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T17:00:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/26/the-anti-gay-christians-are-losing/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve said this before, but it’s a mixed bag for me that so many Christians treat gay people the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side, they’re pushing gay people (and many liberal allies) away from their churches and faith.  And that’s a plus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the down side, they hurt many gay people in the process.  And I wish that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But times are changing and the likes of bigots like &lt;strong&gt;James Dobson&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rick Warren&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/strong&gt; and all those anti-gay Christian leaders (who secretly have gay sex) are losing their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallup polled Americans on their “perceived moral acceptability of gay/lesbian relations” and &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/135764/Americans-Acceptance-Gay-Relations-Crosses-Threshold.aspx"&gt;the trend is in the right direction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://sas-origin.onstreammedia.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/2cqlvqnybuikm7dz4jllsg.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sas-origin.onstreammedia.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/2cqlvqnybuikm7dz4jllsg.gif" title="GallupGayPoll" width="464" height="264"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance of gay/lesbian relations are above 50% for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catholics, moderates, and independents showed the largest increases in support of gay relations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://sas-origin.onstreammedia.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/zkyp_lbmrkktxjujbn9zoq.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sas-origin.onstreammedia.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/zkyp_lbmrkktxjujbn9zoq.gif" title="GallupGayPoll2" width="441" height="417"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/05/chart-of-the-day-3.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The religious grouping with the biggest increase in moral acceptance: Catholics, with a 16 point gain in tolerance since the hierarchy decided to demonize gays and banish them from the seminaries. Keep it up, your Holiness. And the issue of homosexuality isolates Republicans from Independents more than any other issue I’ve seen: 61 percent of Independents and Democrats alike see gay relationships as morally acceptable; only 35 percent of Republicans do. And the moderates are changing twice as quickly as Republicans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re getting to a point where Republicans will find it increasingly difficult to demonize gay people in order to galvanize their base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not there yet, but it’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more Christians push an anti-gay agenda, the faster intelligent younger Christians will move away from them (and hopefully see the problem with religion in general).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty fun watching conservative Christians self-destruct because of their own homophobia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From Wuttke and Poschmann, 2010.

In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin said of the fossil record:

For my part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, in which the history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely separated formations.

The relatively few pages which naturalists had to work with by the time of Darwin's 1859 writing had been cobbled together from numerous discoveries in many places, and even today paleontologists must often sift through scraps as they update and revise the story of life on earth. Nevertheless, there are a few places in which a greater number of fossil "words" and "sentences" have been kept safe - sites of exceptional preservation which record tales of ancient life in exquisite detail. One such place is Germany's Lake Enspel, and in the 24 million year old vestiges of the ancient lake paleontologists have found clues to an ancient interaction between predator and prey.

Here&amp;#39;s the premise: the Republicans saw, in their remote and confused sort of way, that the internet (aka &amp;quot;series of tubes&amp;quot;) had some real potential, and looked really smart, and maybe if they took advantage of it, they could look a little less yokely and rubish. Seriously. &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/25/AR2010052504396.html"&gt;You can't make this stuff up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lest you think Republicans are just discovering the Internet, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) let it be known that "House Republicans have tweeted five times as many as the House Democrats. Leader Boehner has almost five times as many Facebook fans as Speaker Pelosi." Boehner grinned and gave a double thumbs-up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Rep. Mike Pence (Ind.) contributed to the discussion by twice giving out the wrong address for the new site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did they do that was making them so pathetically proud? They created an open web site to formulate an agenda for the future of the Republican party, where anyone could make any proposal, and everyone could vote on it. No filters, except against profanity. The doors are open, y'all are invited to come on in and tell the Republicans what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are predictable: complete chaos. Teabaggers are raving, liberal saboteurs are inserting all kinds of crazy suggestions, and &lt;i&gt;you can't tell them apart&lt;/i&gt;. You tell me; which of the following suggestions are serious, and which are taking the piss?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'teacher' told my child in class that dolphins were mammals and not fish! And the same thing about whales! We need TRADITIONAL VALUES in all areas of education. If it swims in the water, it is a FISH. Period! End of Story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Require all Muslims in the U.S. to wear ankle bracelet transponders so we know where the terrorists are at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should administer capital punishment to anyone who has an abortion. In order to cut costs that the death penalty normally entails, we will have lax gun laws that will allow people to obtain guns with greater ease. Then we would allow the "free-market" to dictate whose philosophy wins out - the liberals irrational philosophy or our logical and God following philosophy. Liberals who have abortions would be taken care of by a militia of the willing who will get rid of all liberals who take the life others irrationally and will allow us to remove all of our opponents to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;all leaders should proclaim faith in Jesus Christ. anyone who does not, like muslims and atheists should be removed from office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's like Poe's Law written out all across the country, on every subject. It's insane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've also discovered another little problem: Americans are rushing to take part in the hilarity, and this error message is coming up all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very high volume of Americans are speaking out right now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please wait a moment and try again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet they are. Every basement-dwelling troglodyte with an opinion, and every laughing liberal looking for a giggle, is hitting that site right now. And once again, the Republicans are looking like incompetent idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though there are some great eco-friendly cleaning products on the market today, imagine a world where all you needed to make messes disappear was water. No chemicals, no residue, no waste. Well, water isn’t &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; you’d need; first you’d have to pick up an &lt;a href="http://www.activeion.com/"&gt;Ionator&lt;/a&gt;. This miracle-product takes H2O and a little bit of electricity to ionize the water, attracting dirt and bacteria and wiping surfaces clean. Bill Nye (yes, The Science Guy) explains it all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.activeion.com/estore/Category/5_1/Products.aspx"&gt;ActiveIon Ionator HOM&lt;/a&gt; will run you around $180, but imagine how much money (and plastic) you could save every month in cleaning supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloody Disgusting got the exclusive tip today (and confirmed) that Sigourney Weaver has been secured for the role of “Margaret Matheson” in the film that follows a para-psychologist who attempts to debunk a very reputable psychic who has just returned to the limelight after 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooooh! This could be very good: badass Alien-killing Ghostbusting Sigourney as a skeptic who (SHOCK) may actually be correct? That’s just a theory, of course, but judging by the director’s single-sentence synopsis, it sounds like it could be about how “psychics” and their ilk use cold reading, sleight-of-hand, and good ol’ fashioned bullshitting to get one over on the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but who is the real-life parapsychologist inspiration? There’s gotta be one. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;Randi&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_blackmore"&gt;Sue Blackmore&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Hyman"&gt;Ray Hyman&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The info is so new that there isn’t even an IMDB page for the movie yet, so hopefully we’ll find out more soon. In the meanwhile, let’s talk other recent skeptic-friendly cinema: Carrie gave big props to the very skeptical main character of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/skepchick-movie-review-how-to-train-your-dragon/"&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and I really enjoyed the recent &lt;em&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/em&gt; reboot, where logical reasoning triumphs over paranormal explanations. And I haven’t seen it yet, but I’m told that &lt;em&gt;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&lt;/em&gt; is pretty great and nerdy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what a finished well is supposed to look like before the mud is pumped out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green=platform&lt;br&gt;
Blue=riser&lt;br&gt;
Red=BOP&lt;br&gt;
Grey=casing&lt;br&gt;
Black=oil reservoir&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://morsdei.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/well.png"&gt;&lt;img title="well" src="http://morsdei.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/well.png?w=300&amp;amp;h=225" alt="" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how the casing goes all the way through the reservoir? This is done to prevent a blowout of a finished well. Once the well is put finished, oil is produced by perforating (poking a hole) in the casing. If oil is leaking from a well that was in the process of being finished, it wasn’t finished. If you get an abnormal reading in one pressure test and a normal one on a subsequent test, don’t just ignore that abnormal test; something is happening you dumbasses. If you put in 5 barrels of fluid and get back 15, you’ve probably got a leak. If you shut down a pump and pressure &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt;, there is a problem. BP did a sloppy job on the drilling process and in its rush to move &lt;em&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/em&gt; off the well so it could be produced, completely and utterly fucked it up. As a result of this and numerous other smaller spills, botches, and fuck ups which BP has been cited for, I propose a means to alleviate such future problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP is required to pay out of pocked for the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; cost of clean-up. BP is &lt;em&gt;not allowed&lt;/em&gt; to produce this well or sell any of the crude which is recovered from the cleanup. Instead, another company should be given this well and the oil salvaged. The EPA should confiscate this well and donate it to another company; the one which receives this gift should be the one with the best environmental and safety record. Half of the profit from this well and the oil from the cleanup should go to the states affected by this spill. (The remaining half, of course, goes to the company that takes environmental and personnel safety seriously)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, in this instance, gross negligence is easily provable, thus BPs liability for cleanup costs is not set at the $75 million mark. BP (as a large, multibillion dollar a year company), I think, could make an excellent example of a large company being held accountable for its mistakes. The cost of cleanup (&amp;gt;$5 billion) could take a sizable chunk out of BPs annual profit (~$22 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as he had suspected, the bar-tailed godwits headed out over the  open ocean and flew south through the Pacific. They did not stop at  islands along the way. Instead, they traveled up to 7,100 miles in nine  days — the longest nonstop flight ever recorded. “I was speechless,” Mr.  Gill said. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider what might be  the ultimate test of human endurance in  sports, the Tour de France: Every day, bicyclists pedal  up and down mountains for hours. In the process, they raise their  metabolism to about five times their resting rate.  The bar-tailed godwit, by contrast, elevates its metabolic rate between 8  and 10 times.  And instead of ending each day with a big dinner and a  good night’s rest, the birds fly through the night, slowly starving  themselves as they travel 40 miles an hour. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, ruby-throated hummingbirds returning north in the spring will  set out from the Yucatán Peninsula in the evening and arrive in the  southern United States the next afternoon. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Gill and his colleagues have recorded similar odysseys from other  wading birds, using satellite transmitters. They found that  bristle-thighed curlews fly as far as 6,000 miles without a stop,  traveling from Alaska to the Marshall Islands. They have also recorded  whimbrels flying 5,000 miles nonstop from Alaska to Central America. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the birds are ready to leave, their bodies are 55 percent  fat. In humans, anything more than 30 percent is considered obese. But  as soon as the birds are done eating, their livers and intestines become  dead weight. They then essentially “eat” their organs, which shrink 25  percent. The birds use the proteins to build up their muscles even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the weird thing is that we have &lt;em&gt;no idea &lt;/em&gt;how the birds find their way.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Jack from &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Miss Baker's Biology class&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.statenislandacademy.org/" title=""&gt;Staten Island Academy&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions. Jack wrote about his experience at ScienceOnline2010 &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/2010/01/26/jacks-experience-at-science-online/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and wrote a blog post about video/computer games &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/2010/03/09/vitamin-g-video-games-and-you/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you from?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jack pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Jack%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I'm Jack, a freshman student who went to Science Online 2010. I am one of Miss Baker's students and I'm from NJ. I go to school at Staten Island Academy. I currently play the piano but I am planning to get a drum set to teach myself drums, too. I love making things whether it be some random contraption built out of paper or a game to be put online. I always liked making things since I built stuff with legos when I was in lower school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy using photoshop and flash together to make games. Recently, I decided to also write out my own music for the games. I am currently making a few games that have absorbed most of my free time. Between painstakingly creating graphics and filtering through code to thinking of music for the games, my free time is pretty much gone. As for my goals, I always wanted to design and create new devices or develop new software. I really want to go to M.I.T. for college, and I've been doing my best in and out of school to try and get there. On a completely different note, I also want to learn Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the amount of freedom that the web gives people, as anyone can access a world-wide database of knowledge for almost any subject. I currently surf the web to find aid in the programming world whenever I have trouble with a script. I also enjoy how the web can be used as a great device for gathering information and doing research. As I move along in developing my programming skills, it is great to talk with fellow programmers to brainstorm possible techniques of getting around difficulties like run time or complex functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work and school? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do and want to accomplish?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Facebook has helped me immensely as it is quicker and more open than e-mailing, so if I or someone else needs a little help with something, they can simply put it up and one of their friends can help out. I also think it is a great way to spread cool articles and facts. Twitter on the other hand has been abused by hundreds of people. No, I really don't care that you are "enjoying your microwavable pizza" mrtwittrface. Because of all of the "eating this" or "listening to that" tweets on Twitter, I really can't get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As Miss Baker, when teaching the Biology class, gives you a lot of creative freedom, how does that affect your own interest in the subject? Do you think you learn better this way? What would you suggest to do differently to make it even better? What are some of your own projects you did for the class?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I found it easier to learn by writing a blog post and commenting on others. Having the creative freedom allowed me to learn what I wanted to, while also allowing the output of the project to be read and understood by people who aren't just my classmates. Not only was I able to learn about how video games affect the brain, but I also got to make a game and work on my programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the fact that people were able to come together for a few days to talk about how the internet is used in science. It was cool to be one of the 8 kids there looking at everything from a different view than most of the other people there. I can't believe that while I was presenting, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/04/scienceonline2010_-_interview_31.php" title=""&gt;Beth Beck&lt;/a&gt; (jokingly) asked, "Would you like a job at NASA?" but I was so focused on not messing up that the question just flew over my head. I didn't want to ruin my opportunity to present at a conference in front of scientists and journalists and everyone else who was there, too. Because of that moment, I'm now working harder than before on my "occupation" of making flash games, as I realized that I could make a positive impact with my programming knowledge, but I need to keep working on getting better first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scienceonline2010_-_interview_50.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/GB1Kajd_u6Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274887528579"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/northern_ireland_culture_is_ap.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/691ae8712f222662</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Northern Ireland culture is apparently cuckoo</title><published>2010-05-26T15:21:39Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T15:21:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/9DhQ4q84cDU/northern_ireland_culture_is_ap.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/northern_ireland_culture_is_ap.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Culture Minister for Northern Ireland is a born-again Christian kook who has decided that the Ulster Museum is insufficiently respectful of the notion that a magic man in the sky poofed the universe into existence in 4004 BC  — the farmers on the plains of Mehrgarh and the potters of Mesopotamia were probably greatly surprised to be conjured out of chaos so abruptly, their shock only exceeded by the later confused state of Egypt&amp;#39;s Sixth Dynasty, which was simultaneously exterminated by a great flood from that psychopath, Jehovah, and also continued unbroken with no notice of their extinction for another 150 years. Resilient folk, those Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the nutcase in question, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/may/26/northern-ireland-ulster-museum-creationism"&gt;Nelson McCausland, has demanded more attention be paid to his clueless creation myth&lt;/a&gt;. No, not the &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt; myth with Fomorians and Fir Bolg and the Tuatha de Danaan, not even the one with frost giants and cows licking people into being, but some weird &lt;i&gt;Hebrew&lt;/i&gt; fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson McCausland, who believes that Ulster Protestants are one of the lost tribes of Israel, has written to the museum's board of trustees urging them to reflect creationist and intelligent design theories of the universe's origins.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Democratic Unionist minister said the inclusion of anti-Darwinian theories in the museum was "a human rights issue".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
McCausland defended a letter he wrote to the trustees calling for anti-evolution exhibitions at the museum. He claimed that around one third of Northern Ireland's population believed either in intelligent design or the creationist view that the universe was created about 6,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird. I had no idea the Protestants of Northern Ireland and our Native Americans all belonged to the same peripatetic tribe. Or that preaching ignorance and lies was a human right that must be supported by the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the appeal to a majority ruling on science was familiar creationist nonsense. When will these loons learn that museums and schools should only teach the stories that are sensible, rational, and &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; and not simply every random every eruption of lunacy that some deluded clique finds compatible with their dogma?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will not be surprised to learn that McCausland is a member of DUP, and is a Paisleyite, another crazy creationist Bible-walloper. He also uses the same justification of appeal to the mob to &lt;a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/culture-minister-nelson-mccausland--on-gays-and-the-gaa-14475524.html"&gt;defend his views on homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not be a supporter of Gay Pride, and I think that in spite of attempts to portray it as an event that's going to boost the country and increase the number of major events in the city, I think the majority of people in Northern Ireland would have great reservations and in many cases strong opposition to it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe it is the will of God that relationships should be heterosexual. I believe that's what God intended and planned. But I would not treat anyone unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fascinating how often bigotry and ignorance go together. One might almost speculate that there's a causal relationship there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/05/11/oilspill-testimony/"&gt;parties responsible struggle to shift the blame&lt;/a&gt;, the Gulf oil spill has reached the shore, as this &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/05/oil_reaches_louisiana_shores.html"&gt;tragically long photo essay&lt;/a&gt; shows. There is a cost to these risky ventures in offshore drilling, and they are not adequately paid by the companies doing the dirty work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who would profit need to pay the price. There are clearly at least three companies that shouldn&amp;#39;t be arguing…they should be coughing up the cash, and recognizing that their businesses will have to be slightly less profitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/thank_you_bp_thank_you_transoc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/r-JvqyDZFZs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274886498688"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1990">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cb590454e3c2c55f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="crop circles"/><title type="html">It’s Crop Circle Season</title><published>2010-05-26T14:21:50Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T14:21:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1990" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2010/wilton/IMG3671.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" align="right"&gt;I have to admit, I love crop circles. I think they are a compelling art form. So I have anticipated for many years the coming of crop circle season in the Spring. Circle makers have really progressed the art form tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the first one I have seen so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme seems to be mathematical – a common theme. The implication is that aliens are trying to communicate to use through the use of math and music, of course they never seem to teach us anything – just copy established mathematics. But it does represent the utility of math in producing beautiful symmetry in art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crop circles pretty much have to be mathematical – the mechanisms used to make them by necessity result in geometric shapes with mathematical relationships. It’s like using the Spirograph, and then marveling at the perfect symmetry and mathematical relationships of the resulting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread473184/pg1"&gt;Here is a funny account&lt;/a&gt; by a person claiming to have made the famous Avebury crop circle. It is all about technique, and circle makers have improved the craft over the years so that following a few simple procedures can produce amazing results. (Not unlike many art forms.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to admire crop circles as an art form, while chuckling a the true believers who have such little faith in human ingenuity (or such a desire to believe in the fantastical) that they conclude they could not have been the work of humans.&lt;/p&gt;

As I quickly scrolled through to get to &lt;a href="https://dcprinciples.org/publications/tphys/2009html/august/wine_wiz.htm"&gt;the Wine Wizard's&lt;/a&gt; column (which I always read first), my eye happened to catch the membership list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;I'm not sure why I stopped where I stopped, but I happened to notice the list of recently deceased physiologists and learned that &lt;a href="http://www.noll.psu.edu/#hplh"&gt;Elsworth Buskirk&lt;/a&gt; had died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="left"&gt;

While a graduate student with Henry Taylor at the University of Minnesota in the 1950s, he helped conduct the work that lead to the standardization of how we measure maximal oxygen uptake during exercise (VO2max) today.  In that landmark study, Taylor, Buskirk, and Henschel found that increasing the grade of the treadmill, not the speed, produced a reproducible curve with a well-defined plateau where VO2max was achieved. Because Buskirk and his colleagues were able to set a definition for VO2max (the point where O2 consumption fails to increase by at least 2.1 mL/kg/min), they were able to reproduce the measurement and describe its precision.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/Elsworth%20figure.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Elsworth figure.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/05/Elsworth%20figure-thumb-512x224-49849.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="512" height="224"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/8/1/73?ijkey=b300dc8e321e69ceb45a68876c9ab3358d72cf15&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;Figure

Freely available &lt;a href="http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/8/1/73?ijkey=b300dc8e321e69ceb45a68876c9ab3358d72cf15&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This type of protocol also removed the effects of motivation and skill, both of which are required to run at high speed and limit all test subjects except for well-trained athletes. In his PhD work he went on to define the components of body composition that influence VO2max and found that 85% of VO2max differences can be explained by differences in lean mass.  This work lead to many of the normalization factors that we use in exercise testing.  There&amp;#39;s no doubt that this careful work influenced the exercise 
community to accept VO2max as one of the standard measures of fitness. The initial development of an standardized exercise protocol,  the clear, rigorous definition of VO2max, and his studies of body composition, began a line of work that now allows clinicians and exercise physiologists to measure VO2max in patients with a variety of exercise limitations.  All of the criteria now set by the American College of Sports Medicine are based on work done by Elsworth Buskirk.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;During his time with the NIH, Dr. Buskirk was director of an environmental chamber facility.  The metabolic chamber he built there was the precursor and prototype to &lt;a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VfFozVcDtXkJ:www.sportsci.org/encyc/drafts/VO2_metabolic_carts.doc+metabolic+cart&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;the first metabolic cart&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most important tools to exercise physiologists.  Dr. Buskirk later founded the Laboratory for Human Performance Research at Penn State, the first independent center dedicated to the study of exercise and environmental stress, and a graduate program in applied physiology, one of the most prestigious exercise physiology programs in the United States.  There, he studied the effects of temperature, hydration, altitude, inactivity and obesity on performance.  In 1968 the Olympics were held in Mexico City.  Because little was known about altitude exposure, Dr. Buskirk and colleagues studied the effects of altitude in elite athletes and found that high altitude did not impair the athlete&amp;#39;s performance upon return to lower altitude.  Additional studies that developed from this work led to the concept that eventually came to be known as &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/27/science/live-high-train-low-and-move-faster.html?pagewanted=1"&gt;live high, train low.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who knew him will undoubtedly remember Elsworth Buskirk as a tremendous physiologist with a passion for science.  He will certainly be missed.  Thankfully, an interview with Dr. Buskirk was archived as part of the American Physiological Society&amp;#39;s Living History Project in 2009.  You can watch &lt;a href="http://www.the-aps.org/Video/LivingHistory/ElsworthBuskirk.htm"&gt;a video of the interview here&lt;/a&gt; and learn more about his incredible life and career.&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/farewell_to_a_great_exercise_p.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/qb4Cif3sec0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274885830741"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=16359">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91899c7eee71b090</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="Atlantis"/><category term="Heiko Mehring"/><category term="ISS"/><category term="Space Shuttle"/><category term="Sun"/><category term="Thierry Legault"/><title type="html">Two solar ISS transits!</title><published>2010-05-26T13:23:55Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T13:23:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/AWSvfWq7X-A/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/26/two-solar-iss-transits/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have two more amazing images for you! Both show the same thing — the International Space Station crossing the Sun — but in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is, once again, from Thierry Legault:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.astrophoto.fr/iss_atlantis_transit2_2010.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/thierry_transit_iss.jpg" alt="thierry_transit_iss" title="thierry_transit_iss" width="610" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! You can clearly see the station (with &lt;em&gt;Atlantis&lt;/em&gt; docked on the left!) as it crosses the Sun. Here’s a slight closeup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/thierry_transit_iss2.jpg" alt="thierry_transit_iss2" title="thierry_transit_iss2" width="601" height="460"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a nice sunspot pair there in the upper right; the one on the right looks like a face, actually. Cute. This shot was taken at 1/8000th of a second, which froze the action nicely. He has &lt;a href="http://www.astrophoto.fr/iss_atlantis_transit2_2010.html"&gt;higher resolution pictures on his webpage&lt;/a&gt; for this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second picture is slightly different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heiko-schaut-ins-all.de/hsia/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/heiko_iss_transit.jpg" alt="heiko_iss_transit" title="heiko_iss_transit" width="610" height="279"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was taken by &lt;a href="http://www.heiko-schaut-ins-all.de/hsia/"&gt;Heiko Mehring&lt;/a&gt; and obviously shows a &lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt; of silhouettes as the ISS and Atlantis crossed the Sun. You can clearly see the same sunspots, but the path of the spacecraft is slightly different, and the spots look a bit different as well. The equipment Heiko used was less fancy than what Thierry has, but you can still see a lot of detail in the image. It really is amazing that we can see such detail on the station from the ground!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the atmosphere was steadier at Thierry’s observing site too; &lt;a href="http://www.astrophoto.fr/iss_atlantis_transit2_2010.html"&gt;in the images on his page&lt;/a&gt; you can see the granulation on the surface of the Sun. Those granules are vast columns of hot gas rising to the Sun’s surface, cooling off, then sinking again. It’s a grand version of the convection that happens when you boil water in your teapot! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-Sat-Trans-2010-05-25.htm"&gt;A third site with a great shot of the transit&lt;/a&gt; was pointed out in the comments below. I wonder how many more are out there?] &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of shots take a lot of planning, a lot of experience, and a bit of good fortune (or whatever politically correct term skeptics are supposed to use these days). When I was younger I shot a LOT of film of the Moon, and got maybe a 10% success rate if I was doing well. Digital cameras and the Internet make it a whole lot easier to get spectacular shots like these. I’m glad to see more people tackling these difficult shots, and expect that we’ll be seeing lots more like these as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip o’ the dew cap to Thierry Legault and Jan Sorg for sending these to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Andrew Wakefield himself will be the keynote speaker, and there will even be some &lt;a href="http://www.americanpersonalrights.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=86&amp;amp;Itemid=79" rel="nofollow"&gt;very bad music promoting the anti-vaccine message&lt;/a&gt;. The rally, with its wonderfully Orwellian title, &lt;a href="http://americanpersonalrights.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The American Rally for Personal Rights&lt;/a&gt;, will be pure anti-vaccine activism in support of pseudoscience on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those supporting science-based medicine plan, led by Skepchick Elyse Anders, to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/action-alert-chicago-vax-protest-wednesday/"&gt;be there to promote science over the conspiracy theories and fear mongering&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-vaccine movement uses to frighten parents out of vaccinating their children. I realize it’s short notice. I realize that you very likely will be outnumbered, given the combination of short notice and the fact that the anti-vaccine zealots have been organizing and promoting this rally for weeks, if not months. Nonetheless, you’ll be doing me a particular solid if you can show up there. Details are &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/action-alert-chicago-vax-protest-wednesday"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are also going to be &lt;a href="http://http://americanpersonalrights.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=88&amp;amp;Itemid=81" rel="nofollow"&gt;satellite rallies&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, Washington, and New York. They look as though they’ll be much smaller; so, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/rally_for_community_health_in.php"&gt;P.Z. Myers points out&lt;/a&gt;, even if a couple of people can go it could have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you see J.B. Handley, Jenny McCarthy (I don’t know if she’ll be there or not but thought I’d mention her anyway), Andrew Wakefield, Kim Stagliano, or any other prominent anti-vaccine loon with whom I’ve tussled from time to time here and elsewhere, please tap him or her on the shoulder, smile broadly, and tell ‘em Dr. Gorski says hi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly J.B. Handley, for at least three reasons&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/05/david-gorski-md.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/dr-david-gorski-and-his-merry-band-of-idiots-dont-like-full-page-ads.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/11/dr-david-gorski-jumps-the-shark-over-desiree-jennings-case.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The rally, with its wonderfully Orwellian title, &lt;a href="http://americanpersonalrights.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The American Rally for Personal Rights&lt;/a&gt;, will be pure crankery on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those supporting science-based medicine plan, led by Skepchick Elyse Anders, to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/action-alert-chicago-vax-protest-wednesday/"&gt;be there to promote science over the conspiracy theories and fear mongering&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-vaccine movement uses to frighten parents out of vaccinating their children. I realize it's short notice. I realize that you very likely will be outnumbered, given the combination of short notice and the fact that the anti-vaccine zealots have been organizing and promoting this rally for weeks, if not months. Nonetheless, you'll be doing Orac a particular solid if you can show up there. Details are &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/action-alert-chicago-vax-protest-wednesday"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are also going to be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_american_rally_for_personal_antivacc.php"&gt;satellite rallies&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, Washington, and New York. They look as though they'll be much smaller; so, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/rally_for_community_health_in.php"&gt;P.Z. Myers points out&lt;/a&gt;, even if a couple of people can go it could have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you see J.B. Handley, Jenny McCarthy (I don't know if she'll be there or not but thought I'd mention her anyway), Andrew Wakefield, Kim Stagliano, or any other prominent anti-vaccine loon to whom I've applied some not-so-Respectful Insolence on a regular basis, please tap him or her on the shoulder, smile broadly, and tell 'em Orac says hi.

&lt;p&gt;Pessin’s solution: you just &lt;em&gt;assert it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I suggest instead is that we simply &lt;em&gt;acknowledge&lt;/em&gt; the  paradox:  that is, recognize that both contradictory propositions are,  in their own right, extremely plausible.  In the preface case this  actually seems quite easy to do.  My ultimate hope, then, is that world  peace will break out when enough people simply acknowledge the paradox  as well and begin applying it more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because acknowledging the paradox allows you simultaneously to say  two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose some important, life-governing, very controversial thing you  happen to believe in with great fervor:  the existence of God (or  perhaps atheism), the truth of Christianity (or Islam or Hinduism,  etc.), absolute morality (or relativism), etc.  Focusing on religion as  our example, you can now say, first, that you believe, with certainty,  on the basis of reason and evidence and testimony, in the truth of, say,  the various individual tenets of your version of Christianity, and thus  believe, with equal certainty, in all the things entailed by that  belief: that, say, all other competing religions and doctrines are  simply false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you can say, second, something else:  that you may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it?  You can simultaneously be certain that Christianity is true  and everything conflicting with it is false, and yet acknowledge that  you may be wrong &lt;em&gt;without taking away your certainty&lt;/em&gt;.  You can  thus keep your certainties without having to claim that you are, in  fact, and grossly implausibly, infallible. It’s what everyone (other  than bakers) has yearned for since time immemorial:  the proverbial  cake, both eaten yet had!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it!  Jesus was certainly the son of God, but then he wasn’t, too.  Mohamed was surely God’s prophet but then again maybe he wasn’t.  It’s all so &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the funniest example of religious doublethink I’ve ever seen.  That is, it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be funny if it didn’t show so clearly how faith rots the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pessin, by the way, is the &lt;a href="http://www.conncoll.edu/academics/web_profiles/pessin.html"&gt;chair of the philosophy department&lt;/a&gt; at Connecticut College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the cross they wanted to fix, located in southwestern Illinois:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/images/BaldKnobCross/2007.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.robsherman.com/news/images/BaldKnobCross/2007.jpg" title="BaldKnob" width="260" height="493"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More money was given to them later, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheist &lt;strong&gt;Rob Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.semissourian.com/story/1637318.html"&gt;trying to do something about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attended a meeting of the Christian group last night and asked that they return the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If members do not, Sherman said he will file a lawsuit to force the return of the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross is operated by a group that makes being a Christian a requirement for membership on its board of directors, Sherman noted. And the Illinois Constitution bars the legislature from granting money “for any sectarian purpose,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this isn’t unconstitutional, I don’t know what is,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the group’s response?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Friends intend to listen politely to Sherman but refuse to return the money, said the Rev. Bill Vandergraph, pastor of the Full Gospel Pentecostal Church in Alto Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A repaired cross will be a big tourist draw and that justifies the use of state funds, Vandergraph said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This guy is a noted atheist, and he has no concerns about church and state,” he said. “He is just against anything religious.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase: Sherman is completely right, so we’ll just try to attack his character by calling him an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Pat Quinn&lt;/strong&gt; won’t do anything about this.  He has already allowed &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/04/09/illinois-rob-sherman-files-lawsuit-against-illinois-governor-to-block-religious-grants/"&gt;$2,300,000,000 to go to religious groups&lt;/a&gt; (and Sherman has filed a lawsuit against that, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more exposure Sherman gets for his &lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/2010/05/23.htm"&gt;potential lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, the better.  The Christian group is just hoping this is far enough below the radar so that no one will notice the illegality of all of this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The subject of your last conversation, the lead story on the news last night, the pictures on the wall at the test site—this trivia is presumed to have zero impact on your score in geometry or chemistry.  Trouble is, it&amp;#39;s increasingly clear that this presumption is simply false.  Case in point: This study, published in last month&amp;#39;s Journal of Social Psychology, which erased the usual gender gap in high-school chemistry tests. All it took was a change in the illustrations in a textbook.

Jessica J. Good, Julie A. Woodzicka and Lylan C. Wingfield of Rutgers University gave a short chemistry exam to local 9th and 10th graders—29 male and 52 female.  The students read three pages of a chemistry text and then took the test on the material. All the texts were the same, but they were illustrated differently. One third of the students saw pictures in which everyone was a man.  For another, there were only women in the illustrations.  And a third group had a text with pictures of both male and female chemists.

Girls who read the text with all-female pictures scored a great deal better than girls who got other versions. In fact, girls who saw only women chemists in their text scored better than boys. Boys did best with the all-male images, though not by much.  And mixed-gender images didn&amp;#39;t alter the usual gender gap (as far as I can tell; it&amp;#39;s a little hard to discern from the abstract, and the paper is behind the journal&amp;#39;s price-gouging paywall).

It&amp;#39;s not clear if there is a non-depressing intervention suggested by this—to get girls&amp;#39; scores higher, do we have to depress boys&amp;#39;?—but I think there&amp;#39;s a more fundamental point: Given how susceptible people are to cues from their immediate surroundings, we can&amp;#39;t assume that ability is a fixed and measurable quantity.  We&amp;#39;re a social species, ever-responding to social perceptions.  Even sitting quietly with a pencil and a geometry problem is a social act, as variable and shifty as a conversation.  Until we understand the moment-to-moment effects of other people on the mind, we can&amp;#39;t be sure what our tests are measuring.

The workbench gathers cancer information from a wide variety of projects including Johns Hopkins University and GlaxoSmithKline Cancer Cell Line Genomic Profiling Data, NCI’s Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET), NHGRI’s Tumor Sequencing Project (TSP), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Sanger Center’s COSMIC initiative and presents the cumulative data as high-level summary visualizations. The CGWB’s genome-browser view is built on a UCSC Genome Browser backbone, for power and flexibility.

I noticed an announcement in the May 7th Nature Signaling Gateway Update email that the NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction  Database – May Update was featuring a bioinformatics primer on The Cancer Genome Workbench. The primer is great &amp;amp; goes into much more detail about the Cancer Genome Workbench than I will be able to in this quick tip. I strongly check the primer, and the workbench out. When I went over to the workbench to explore, I quite honestly was a bit taken back by the complexity of the displays – the amount of data presented in their summary visualizations are somewhat intense.

I hope that in my tip movie I will be able to convince you that the small investment you will need to do to get acclimated to their images is well worth the amount of data you will quickly understand how to analyze. The views are so data rich, it takes a bit of adjusting to – there is very little labeling (to keep displays as clean as possible) and information is provided via pop-up messages as you scroll over the display. Once I got past the intensity of the displays, I was really amazed by the scope of data visualized in CGWB displays – data on every chromosome &amp;amp; gene over multiple datasets/experiments, in one 2D image. As the NCI primer says, cancer is complex – really complex. Being able to see such ‘big picture’ views as those provided by the Cancer Genome Workbench is a really powerful analysis aid. I for one am impressed with this resource, which is why I’ve chosen to feature it today.

In my 5 minute tip I was only able to show you the briefest of glimpses of the CGWB landscape and heatmap views. I was not able to show you the details of wither view, including a hyperlinked list of genes with the highest mutation frequencies. Nor was I able to show you the full scope of other views which include genome browser views (based on the UCSC Genome browser, as I mentioned earlier), correlation plots, protein domain views, 3D vizualizations, as well as next-gen and trace sequence views. Check out figure 1 of the bioinformatics primer to see examples of those.

I’ve added a citation to the original CGWB publication. It was published in 2007, and so does not cover all the current functions of the workbench, but I think reading it might help give you an idea of the workbench because it goes into the goals and background that the CGWB is based on more than the primer, which is much more up-to-date and focuses on the functionality of the workbench. In this paper you can also read how the authors utilized the workbench to analyze three public datasets, and see how it expanded their research findings.

All &amp;amp; all, I think the Cancer Genome Workbench is an amazing resource for cancer research. Be sure to check out the tip movie, the primer, the original CGWB publication and especially the CGWB! Thanks for joining us for this week’s tip.

&lt;p&gt;This is a central question with respect to recent temperature trends, but of course it is much more general and applies to a whole range of climate changes over all time scales. Judging from comments we receive here and discussions elsewhere on the web, there is a fair amount of confusion about how this process works and what can (and cannot) be said with confidence. For instance, many people appear to (incorrectly) think that attribution is just based on a naive correlation of the global mean temperature, or that it is impossible to do unless a change is ‘unprecedented’ or that the answers are based on our lack of imagination about other causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the process is more sophisticated than these misconceptions imply and I’ll go over the main issues below. But the executive summary is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You can’t do attribution based only on statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Attribution has nothing to do with something being “unprecedented”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; You always need a model of some sort &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The more distinct the fingerprint of a particular cause is, the easier it is to detect &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it helps enormously to think about attribution in contexts that don’t have anything to do with anthropogenic causes. For some reason that allows people to think a little bit more clearly about the problem.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, think about the difference between attribution in an observational science like climatology (or cosmology etc.) compared to a lab-based science (microbiology or materials science). In a laboratory, it’s relatively easy to demonstrate cause and effect: you set up the experiments – and if what you expect is a real phenomenon, you should be able to replicate it over and over again and get enough examples to demonstrate convincingly that a particular cause has a particular effect. Note that you can’t demonstrate that a particular effect can have only that cause, but should you see that effect in the real world and suspect that your cause is also present, then you can make a pretty good (though not 100%) case that a specific cause is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you need a laboratory to do this? It is because the real world is always noisy – there is always something else going on that makes our (reductionist) theories less applicable than we’d like. Outside, we don’t get to perfectly stabilise the temperature and pressure, we don’t control the turbulence in the initial state, and we can’t shield the apparatus from cosmic rays etc. In the lab, we can do all of those things and ensure that (hopefully) we can boil the experiment down to its essentials. There is of course still ‘noise’ – imprecision in measuring instruments etc. and so you need to do it many times under slightly different conditions to be sure that your cause really does give the effect you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to this kind of attribution is repetition, and this is where it should become obvious that for observational sciences, you are generally going to have to find a different way forward, since we don’t generally get to rerun the Holocene, or the Big Bang or the 20th Century (thankfully). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repetition &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be useful when you have repeating events in Nature – the ice age cycles, tides, volcanic eruptions, the seasons etc. These give you a chance to integrate over any unrelated confounding effects to get at the signal. For the impacts of volcanic eruptions in general, this has definitely been a useful technique (from &lt;a href="http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/WinterWarming.pdf"&gt;Robock and Mao (1992)&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=sh06200v"&gt;Shindell et al (2004)&lt;/a&gt;). But many of the events that have occurred in geologic history are singular, or perhaps they’ve occurred more frequently but we only have good observations from one manifestation – the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, the KT impact event, the 8.2 kyr event, the Little Ice Age etc.  – and so another approach is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world we attribute singular events all the time – in court cases for instance – and so we do have practical experience of this. If the evidence linking specific bank-robbers to a robbery is strong, prosecutors can get a conviction without the crimes needing to have been ‘unprecedented’, and without having to specifically prove that everyone else was innocent. What happens instead is that prosecutors (ideally) create a narrative for what they think happened (lets call that a ‘model’ for want of a better word), work out the consequences of that narrative (the suspect should have been seen by that camera at that moment, the DNA at the scene will match a suspect’s sample, the money will be found in the freezer etc.), and they then try and find those consequences in the evidence. It’s obviously important to make sure that the narrative isn’t simply a ‘just-so’ story, in which circumstances are strung together to suggest guilt, but which no further evidence is found to back up that particular story. Indeed these narratives are much more convincing when there is ‘out of sample’ confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can generalise this: what is a required is a model of some sort that makes predictions for what should and should not have happened depending on some specific cause, combined with ‘out of sample’ validation of the model of events or phenomena that were not known about or used in the construction of the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models come in many shapes and sizes. They can be statistical, empirical, physical, numerical or conceptual. Their utility is predicated on how specific they are, how clearly they distinguish their predictions from those of other models, and the avoidance of unnecessary complications (“Occam’s Razor”). If all else is equal, a more parsimonious explanation is generally preferred as a working hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overriding requirement however is that the model must be predictive. It can’t just be a fit to the observations. For instance, one can fit a Fourier series to a data set that is purely random, but however accurate the fit is, it won’t give good predictions. Similarly a linear or quadratic fit to a time series can be useful form of descriptive statistics, but without any reason to think that there is an underlying basis for such a trend, it has very little predictive value. In fact, any statistical fit to the data is necessarily trying to match observations using a mathematical constraint (ie. trying to minimise the mean square residual, or the gradient, using sinusoids, or wavelets, etc.) and since there is no physical reason to assume that any of these constraints apply to the real world, no &lt;em&gt;purely&lt;/em&gt; statistical approach is going to be that useful in attribution (despite it being attempted &lt;a href="http://tamino.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/not-a-random-walk/"&gt;all the time&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, defining any externally forced climate signal as simply the linear, quadratic, polynomial or spline fit to the data is not sufficient. The corollary which defines ‘internal climate variability’ as the residual from that fit doesn’t work either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do? The first thing to do is to get away from the idea that you can only be using single-valued metrics like the global temperature. We have much more information than that – patterns of changes across the surface, through the vertical extent of the atmosphere, and in the oceans. Complex spatial fingerprints of change can do a much better job at discriminating between competing hypotheses than simple multiple linear regression with a single time-series. For instance, a big difference between solar forced changes compared to those driven by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is that the stratosphere changes in tandem with the lower atmosphere for solar changes, but they are opposed for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-driven change. Aerosol changes often have specific regional patterns change that can be &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=sh02500l"&gt;distinguished&lt;/a&gt; from changes from well-mixed greenhouse gases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected patterns for any particular driver (the ‘fingerprints’) can be estimated from a climate model, or even a suite of climate models with the differences between them serving as an estimate of the structural uncertainty. If these patterns are robust, then one can have confidence that they are a good reflection of the underlying assumptions that went into building the models. Given these fingerprints for multiple hypothesised drivers (solar, aerosols, land-use/land cover change, greenhouse gases etc.), we can than examine the real world to see if the changes we see can be explained by a combination of them. One important point to note is that it is easy to account for some model imperfections – for instance, if the solar pattern is underestimated in strength we can test for whether a multiplicative factor would improve the match. We can also apply some independent tests on the models to try and make sure that only the ‘good’ ones are used, or at least demonstrate that the conclusions are not sensitive to those choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques of course, make some assumptions. Firstly, that the spatio-temporal pattern associated with a particular forcing is reasonably accurate (though the magnitude of the pattern can be too large or small without causing a problem). To a large extent this is the case – the stratospheric cooling/tropospheric warming pattern associated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases is well understood, as are the qualitative land vs ocean/Northern vs. southern/Arctic amplification features. The exact value of polar amplification though is quite uncertain, though this affects all the response patterns and so is not a crucial factor. More problematic are results that indicate that specific forcings might impact existing regional patterns of variability, like the Arctic Oscillation or El Niño. In those cases, clearly distinguishing internal natural variability from the forced change is more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of the above, estimates are required of the magnitude and patterns of internal variability. These can be derived from model simulations (for instance in their pre-industrial control runs with no forcings), or estimated from the observational record. The latter is a problematic because there is no ‘clean’ period where there was only internal variability occurring – volcanoes, solar variability etc. have been affecting the record even prior to the 20th Century. Thus the most straightforward estimates come from the GCMs. Each model has a different expression of the internal variability – some have too much ENSO activity for instance while some have too little, or, the timescale for multi-decadal variability in the North Atlantic might vary from 20 to 60 years for instance. Conclusions about the magnitude of the forced changes need to be robust to these different estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might this work in practice? Take the impact of the Pinatubo eruption in 1991. Examination of the temperature record over this period shows a slight cooling, peaking in 1992-1993, but these temperatures were certainly not ‘unprecedented’, nor did they exceed the bounds of observed variability, yet it is well accepted that the cooling was attributable to the eruption. Why? First off, there was a well-observed change in the atmospheric composition (a layer of sulphate aerosols in the lower stratosphere). Models ranging from 1-dimensional radiative transfer models to full GCMs all suggest that these aerosols were sufficient to alter the planetary energy balance and cause global cooling in the annual mean surface temperatures. They also suggest that there would be complex spatial patterns of response – local warming in the lower stratosphere, increases in reflected solar radiation, decreases in outgoing longwave radiation, dynamical changes in the northern hemisphere winter circulation, decreases in tropical precipitation etc.  These changes were observed in the real world too, and with very similar magnitudes to those predicted. Indeed many of these changes &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi?id=ha00800v"&gt;were predicted&lt;/a&gt; by GCMs before they were observed.&lt;/p&gt;

I thought I'd revisit a post I wrote about this several months ago, from the archives, when this first hit the news after the AAAS conference in San Diego. So here's a modified, updated version of the original post.

The blogosphere is all a-twitter with talk of the recent commentary in Science that dolphins should be considered people. Well, sort of people. Non-human people.

On the heels of the incident at SeaWorld in Florida in which a trainer was killed by one of the killer whales, this is especially an important issue to consider.

Frequent commenter Daniel Bassett writes at his blog, Fishschooled:

The first argument of course is the extreme  intelligence of dolphins. They (1) have larger brains than humans, (2)  have a brain to body weight ratio greater than great apes, and (3) they  are the second most encephalized beings on the planet. Encephalisation  is the folding of the brain and increases volume and surface area, which  has been shown to correlate with intelligence. But intelligence is just  one part of the argument. The neocortex of dolphins is very advanced  and allows them to problem solve and be self aware, and even have a form  of intellect or rational thought. They also have spindle neurons that  are involved in emotions, social cognition, and the ability to sense  what others are thinking.

Thomas White, a philosopher at Loyola  Marymount University, argues that these characteristics makes the  dolphin a person, but a non-human person. They are alive, aware of their  environment, have emotions, have distinct personalities, exhibit self  control, and treat others with respect or ethical consideration. White argues that dolphins tick off all the boxes of what it is to be human.  Research on intelligence is still in it's infancy with a lot to discover. But, based on these ideas can we justify putting dolphins in  places like Seaworld for our own amusement?

He characterized it as a food fad without scientific justification. Now, 58 years later, the science has not changed much at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/ajcn.2010.29269v1?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=organic&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;A recent review of the literature &lt;/a&gt;of the last 50 years shows that there is no evidence for health benefits from eating an organic diet. The only exception to this was evidence for a lower risk of eczema in children eating organic dairy products. But with so many potential correlations to look for, this can just be noise in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important conclusion of this systematic review is the paucity of good research into organic food – they identified only 12 relevant trials. So while there is a lack of evidence for health benefits from eating an organic diet, we do not have enough high-quality studies to say this question has been definitively answered. It is surprising, given the fact that organic food was controversial in the 1950s, that so little good research has been done over the last half-century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that we only recently had any rules in the US regarding the label “organic”. According to the USDA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA), enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill, served to establish uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as “organic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of organic entirely relates to the method of production, not the final product. It involves three principles. One is sustainable farming that is optimal for the environment. That question is beyond the scope of this medical blog. Many people do advocate organic farming for this reason alone, and many of the principles of sustainable farming are being incorporated more generally into agriculture and animal husbandry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second principle is the establishment of an ecosystem, using cover crops, crop rotation, and other methods. Again – I want to set aside the environmental questions and focus on the nutritional claims: Does organic farming result in produce that is more nutritious? There are different ways we can approach this question. One is addressed by the systematic review above: Can we measure a health advantage to eating an organic diet? The answer to that question at the present time is “no.” This could be due to the fact that there is no health benefit, or that any benefit is smaller than the studies currently available could detect. Long term modest health benefits are very difficult to detect with clinical trials, and it is therefore difficult to rule out such benefits, but at present there is no evidence of health benefits from an organic diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second way to approach this question is to evaluate the food products themselves: Are they more nutritious? &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640946"&gt;The most recent systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of the evidence concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the basis of a systematic review of studies of satisfactory quality, there is no evidence of a difference in nutrient quality between organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs. The small differences in nutrient content detected are biologically plausible and mostly relate to differences in production methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-75017.html"&gt;There is also a recent study&lt;/a&gt; concluding that birds prefer seed that is conventionally produced over seed that is organically produced – likely because conventional production methods result in a 10% higher protein content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third issue with organic food is what is not in, or on them – pesticides, hormones and antibiotics. Here, again, we can take the same two approaches as with nutrition: Is there any evidence of a difference between organic and conventional produce, and is there evidence for a health benefit? There seems to be a consensus on the first question. There are lower levels of synthetic pesticides in organic produce and lower  levels of hormones and antibiotics in organic meat than in conventionally grown  equivalents.  But is this safer for health? The review cited above is also relevant to this question, and essentially there is no evidence for greater safety of organic food over conventional food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to pesticides, it must also be noted that organic farming, while using methods to minimize pests and the need for pesticides, still uses organic, rather than synthetic, pesticides. For example a rotenone-pyrethrin mixture is commonly used. Such pesticides are not as well studied as synthetic pesticides, often require more applications, and may persist longer in the soil. In fact the use of “natural” pesticides is nothing more than an appeal to the naturalistic fallacy – there really is no evidence for superior safety, and they have not been adequately studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a recent study which has garnered a great deal of press linking organophosphates – a type of synthetic pesticide – to higher prevalence of ADHD. However, this is a preliminary observational study. While interesting, it really can only be used to justify further research, not any conclusions regarding the effects of organophosphates. (I discuss this article&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1962"&gt; in more detail here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does seem reasonable to minimize human exposure to pesticides. This can be accomplished, at least in part, however, by simply washing all produce thoroughly. I could not find any direct comparisons of organic produce to thoroughly washed conventional produce, but what evidence we do have suggests that residue levels are below safety limits and can be lowered further by washing. This is an area that does require continued monitoring and research, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall there does not appear to be any advantage for health to organic farming (sustainability and environmental effects being a separate issue). However, despite the fact that organic farming has been around for over 50 years, there is a surprisingly small amount of quality research available. The organic farming industry and popularity of organic products is growing. Organic products are more expensive, and questions remain about whether or not such methods would be adequate to supply our food needs. There may also be hidden health risks or unintended consequences to relying upon organic farming. There may also be benefits that have not been adequately documented. Therefore, this is one area where I think it is reasonable to conclude more research is genuinely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

This is as good a time as any to take care of some leftover business from last week that I had planned on writing about but gotten distracted by all the deliciously bad news for the anti-vaccine movement. Besides, what will be going on in Grant Park in Chicago this afternoon fits into this topic perfectly, because the anti-vaccine movement is but one "flavor" of this particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to denialism, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit, I've had a bit of a love-hate relationship with the term denialism. The reason is simple. As many regular readers may know, my first real foray into online debate involved combatting the particularly pernicious form of denialism known as Holocaust denial. Indeed, an &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/01/musings-on-60th-anniversary-of.html"&gt;early post&lt;/a&gt; on this blog written for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz describes how I discovered Holocaust denial and why I've come to despise this particular form of denial, and Holocaust denial is a topic that, evne now, I still revisit from time to time. It's just that I don't do it as often as I used to, mainly because discussing science in medicine has become my primary focus. Still, my ongoing association with combatting Holocaust denial has colored my subsequent activities in combatting quackery and pseudoscience in that I never liked the word "denial" applied to anything other form of pseudoscience or pseudohistory than Holocaust denial because the word's association with Holocaust denial, which is further inextricably linked to Hitler apologia, anti-Semitism, and Nazi-ism, both old school and neo-Nazi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, sometimes I think the very word "denialism" hurts the cause of science because of its association with Holocaust denial. This association makes it very easy for vaccine denialists, evolution denialists (i.e., creationists), HIV/AIDS denialists, anthropogenic climate change denialists, or denialists of scientific medicine (i.e., supporters of unscientific or pseudoscientific "alternative" medicine) to retreat to the cry of the wounded self-righteous, where they claim that the label is in fact tarring them with Holocaust denialism, and all the bigotry and evil that is associated with Holocaust denial. Indeed, the very term "denialism" appears to be an attempt to keep using the term "denial" but to distance it from the the "denial" in Holocaust denial. It doesn't work. In fact, it sometimes even sucks in people who really ought to know better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick in the U.K., &lt;a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/6194/"&gt;scourge of Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; and anti-vaccine loons everywhere, not to &lt;a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/5869/"&gt;mention quackbuster extraordinaire&lt;/a&gt;, who has written an article for the New Scientist that is so misguided it was painful for me to read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/is_one_persons_iconoclastic_views_anothe.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/is_one_persons_iconoclastic_views_anothe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/M2cMcnw_D-4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274874208875"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2351">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/794e145478365566</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">No X No Y?</title><published>2010-05-26T11:36:36Z</published><updated>2010-05-26T11:36:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2351" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've often discussed the stylistic choice between &lt;em&gt;hypotaxis&lt;/em&gt;, where semantic and pragmatic relations are signaled with explicit connectives and syntactic embedding, and &lt;em&gt;parataxis&lt;/em&gt;, which relies more heavily on context and common sense to communicate the same relationships, using phrases strung together like beads on a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paratactic style is &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002465.html"&gt;more modern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003162.html"&gt;more demotic&lt;/a&gt;, and usually shorter. But sometimes, as in the case of this flashing highway sign, it's also harder to interpret:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NoLatinosNoTacos.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Brian Hamacher and Carolyn Ryan, "&lt;a href="http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local-beat/Road-Rage-Hackers-Say-No-Latinos-on-Highway-Sign-94810499.html"&gt;Road Rage: Hackers Say 'No Latinos' on Highway Sign&lt;/a&gt;", NBC News Miami 5/25/2010,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;A highway sign flashing "NO LATINOS NO TACOS" greeted drivers on the Palmetto Expressway in Northwest Miami-Dade, after hackers managed to alter it early Tuesday morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The sign was in the northbound side of the 826, right near the Northwest 25th street exit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;It's unknown how long the sign had been flashing the message, but by 6 a.m., members of the Florida Highway Patrol and a road crew had turned the sign away from the highway and were working to erase the message.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently some hackers have learned to crack the password protection on these portable highway-status signs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Last year, a string of road sign hacks were made in three separate states.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;In Austin, Texas, a sign cautioned drivers to the "ZOMBIES IN AREA! RUN." Another in Collinsville, Illinois said "Daily LANE CLOSURES DUE TO ZOMBIES." And another in rural Indiana read "RAPTORS AHEAD - CAUTION."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many drivers, and the NBC News article, interpreted the sign as a double anti-Latino-immigration slogan: "(There should be) no Latinos (here, and also) no tacos". But Alex Pareene at salon.com &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/05/25/tuesday_link_dump/index.html"&gt;saw another interpretation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Everyone blames racists for the hacked highway sign that says, "NO LATINOS / NO TACOS." But I think they meant that without Latinos, Americans wouldn't have tacos. And that's a pro-immigrant message. Because who hates tacos? No one!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's certainly plenty of precedent for the idea that "No X No Y" implies a conditional relationship between the lack of X and the lack of Y, generally with an implied modal as well: "If there (is, were) no X then there (will, can, should, would) be no Y".  Examples include "No justice / no peace" and "No shirt / no shoes / no service". [And, predating all of these, as DRL pointed out by email, "&lt;a href="http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/special-collections/papers/notickee.htm"&gt;No tickee, no washee&lt;/a&gt;".]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Dan Bruno in the comments links to this 2006 precedent for the conditional interpretation:]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/No_Burritos.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditional interpretation is potentially offensive in its own way,  among other things because it stereotypically trivializes the contributions of Latinos in the U.S., but it might indeed have been intended as a pro-immigrant rather than anti-immigrant message.&lt;/p&gt;

Sounds all well and good but at a recent philosophy of biology conference, he made comments against the New Atheists that &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100525/full/news.2010.260.html"&gt;don’t make much sense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… As we speak, we are establishing our first consulting relationship with a religious congregation in Binghamton to explore their religion and spirituality and to help them be more effective as an organization [by using evolutionary tools]. I think the benefits we provide will be so great that we will be sought after by other congregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Question:] &lt;strong&gt;Does your approach annoy atheists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I piss off atheists more than any other category, and I am an atheist. &lt;strong&gt;One of the things that infuriates me about the newest crop of angry atheists, such as Richard Dawkins, is their denial of the beneficial aspects of religion.&lt;/strong&gt; Their beef is not just that there is no evidence for God. They also insist that religion “poisons everything”, as Christopher Hitchens subtitled his book. They are ignoring the scientific theory and evidence for the “secular utility” of religion, as Émile Durkheim put it, even though they wrap themselves in the mantle of science and rationality. Someone needs to call them out on that, and that person is me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s missing the point of what the New Atheists are saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one — including Dawkins — denies that religion offers benefits like community and hope.  But these are things that you could get with any group of close friends — &lt;em&gt;without having to believe in supernatural nonsense&lt;/em&gt;.  That’s what we’re rallying against.  In order to be part of that community, you must subscribe to beliefs that are not based in reality, that cherish ignorance, and that preach bigotry against certain groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, churches have a better infrastructure than Humanist groups do, but that’s no reason to go running to them.  The detriments far outweigh the benefits.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Hitchens asks a very good question in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446697966?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0446697966"&gt;God is Not Great&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Name an ethical statement or action, made or performed by a person of faith, that could not have been made or performed by a nonbeliever.  I have since asked this question at every stop and haven’t had a reply yet.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hasn’t received a reply because there’s no good answer to that.  Religion doesn’t offer any benefits you couldn’t find in a good secular alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we go after religion.  The claims are ludicrous, but there is a feeling among millions of people that religion makes people better or more moral.  They’re wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Atheists support strong communities of people.  They don’t support membership being restricted to those who buy into religious mythology.&lt;br&gt;

It’s all about sex, of course.  To warn competitors away, males hold onto their branch and shake their rumps up and down, producing a characteristic vibration that rattles nearby branches.  This often leads to a bout of wrestling between males.  I could describe the paper further, but it’s better summarized by this nice report from the last &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/videos/watch/10300"&gt;Science Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to watch to the end, because the frog’s eggs also respond to vibrations! (Click on the screen to begin; if that doesn’t work go to the Science Friday link.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read about this behavior, my first thought was that the vibrations attracted nearby females, but the researchers haven’t studied that yet.  Ten to one the vibrations will prove to be an aphrodesiac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now why did the scientists study this, and why was it published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;?  Many papers include what I call a Reason for Uniqueness (RFU): a couple of lines in either the abstract or the discussion that say why your results are new, exciting, and, above all, unique.  RFUs always begin in a similar way: “This is the first study that shows. . . ” and so on.  All of us like to stick out from the crowd, and we hope that, by making the RFU explicit to overworked editors and reviewers, they will glom on to this sentence and accept our papers.  There’s nothing more damning a reviewer can say about a paper than “This doesn’t really show anything new.” (I don’t much like RFUs, which often smack of self-promotion, but I confess that I’ve used them myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, here’s the RFU for this study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although our study provides, to our knowledge, the first experimental demonstration of communication via plant-borne vibrations in a vertebrate, other arboreal vertebrates almost certainly use this communication channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good RFU, because it points out related work on social communication involving vibration.  But the above is just a fancy way of saying why we really spend our lives making model treefrogs and tree-shaking machines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides one more proof that nature is fantastic and full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the angle is related to the drag force, and because the drag force is related to the velocity of the flow, you can determine the velocity of the flow by only measuring the angle of the pendulum.

You could measure the angle with a protractor, but what we decided to do is to attach a large, light ball to the top of the pendulum and to register the rotation of the ball with a computer mouse. Using a MATLAB program, we transformed the registered rotation (in pixels) to flow velocity (in meters per second)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

This isn&amp;#39;t even my shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergun Caner  has for a long time referred to his radical Muslim turned evangelical  Christian past in his sermons. He’s made a big deal about this. It’s  pretty much the most famous thing about him. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/walid-zafar/ex-muslim-evangelical-exp_b_582225.html"&gt;And it’s all 100% bullshit&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main problem with Caner’s journey from Jihad to Jesus is that  much of it is fiction, a complex lie made up to give his conversion more  authenticity.  He fabricated almost everything.  For someone who  allegedly fought jihad, Caner’s understanding of the very basic tenets  of the faith he is a so-called expert in is rudimentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caner does not know the difference between Islam’s article of faith  and the first chapter of the Qur’an. He’s claimed that the lunar month  of Ramadan lasts for 40 days.  In his book, he writes that he performed  all of the &lt;em&gt;rakats&lt;/em&gt; (daily prayers). The actual word is &lt;em&gt;salah&lt;/em&gt;.   It’s not a difference most people would know, but he says he is an  expert on Islam.  Muslims, he once said, followed something he called  the “tobaad.”  He’s claimed to have debated Muslim scholars who’ve never  heard of him.  Court records from his parent’s divorce indicate that he  was in Ohio when he was a young child, long before his alleged move  from Turkey.  On his books, his middle name is Mehmet (Muhammad in  Turkish), yet it is listed as Michael on his concealed-weapons permit in  Virginia.  Before 9/11, he went by E. Michael Caner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one speech, Caner told a crowd that outside the mosque in Kabul  there was a sign that read, “Do not teach the women to read and write.”   The story may or may not be true, but Caner, to give authority to the  tale, told the crowd what was written in the native tongue: “&lt;em&gt;bahasha  uwtara muwtara seeteeroh&lt;/em&gt;.” That’s neither Dari nor Arabic nor Urdu  nor Turkish nor Pashtu.  It is an entirely made up language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To his audience, Caner’s tale of moving from darkness to light  reaffirmed their convictions about the superiority of Christianity and  the decadence of Islam.  But the facts eventually caught up with Caner,  thanks to a &lt;a href="http://www.fakeexmuslims.com/"&gt;Muslim  student in London&lt;/a&gt; who methodically went through his speeches and  interviews, chronicling each and every one of his lies.  Others quickly  piled on, including some within the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in 2005, Caner came to the defense of Florida-based  preacher Jerry Vines who angered the Muslim community with his  demonization of the Prophet Muhammad.  A piece in the &lt;em&gt;Florida  Times-Union&lt;/em&gt; quoted Caner, who defended Vines by saying, “No one  expected a Baptist preacher to actually research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s precisely why Caner’s duplicitous persona went unchallenged  for so long.  No one expected a preacher to so boldly fabricate his  entire background.  It was all a ruse, intended to play off the  evangelical movement’s ignorance and fear of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course he’s denying he’s ever intentionally misled people about anything while still maintaining the now thoroughly exposed lie &lt;a href="http://www.erguncaner.com/biography/"&gt;on the bio page of his website&lt;/a&gt;. And the really sad part is that the people he duped all these years are still defending his lies. Incredible!&lt;/p&gt;

Okay, actually it had no effect on her whatsoever other than making her all wet. Praise Jesus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:W_wdLVRW8vThcM:http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/images/danish_cartoon_muhammed_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:W_wdLVRW8vThcM:http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas_shrugs/images/danish_cartoon_muhammed_1.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="122"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/thatll_teach_us.php"&gt;Everybody Draw Mohammed Day cause Muslim radicals to retaliate…against the Jews…and against history&lt;/a&gt; – Radical Muslims already hated the Jews and already hated history. But now they’re so outraged about EDMD that they’ve decided to conflate atheism with Judaism and respond by denying the Holocaust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the injustice that takes place in our world stems from  ignorance. We reject being emotionally blackmailed by Hollywood tales  and holocaust museums which legitimize the war crimes and crimes against  humanity of the extremist Atheist regime of Tel-Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job, guys. That’ll show us.&lt;/p&gt;

Three men who spent a decade in jail on a rape conviction were freed because an acupuncturist claimed to know they were virgins. How you might ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said examination of a pressure point beneath the convict’s ear  showed a small capillary was unbroken, which Vietnamese traditional  medicine holds to mean that he was a virgin. Hong then examined the  other two men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I recognised these three men had never had sex with women,” Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhhhh! That makes sense [rolling eyes] But this managed to be enough to reopen the case, which in turn led to the discovery that the initial investigators had made some mistakes. Wow, so maybe acupuncture has finally succeeded in doing something after thousands of years of doing absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/Copernicus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/Copernicus.jpg" alt="" width="164" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5545797/copernicus-given-a-heros-burial450+-years-after-his-death"&gt;Now it’s Copernicus’ turn&lt;/a&gt; – The Catholic Church has pardoned Galileo. It’s pardoned Darwin. And now, after only 450 years, Nicolaus Copernicus was given a hero’s burial. So I guess it’ll be at least that long before the Catholic Church embraces the iPad and Steve Jobs…unless he goes out and starts raping kids. Then they’re likely to make him a saint or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:178px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://dimpost.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/barack_obama.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://dimpost.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/barack_obama.jpg?w=168&amp;amp;h=124" alt="" width="168" height="124"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child rape you can believe in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/obama-administration-sides-vatican-oregon-case"&gt;Obama Administration supports child rapists. Wish he’d mentioned that in the campaign&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a strongly worded brief for the United States Supreme Court, the  Obama administration has sided with the Vatican in an Oregon lawsuit  that names the Holy See as a defendant for its role in the sexual abuse  crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, the brief asserts that the standards for an exception to  the immunity that foreign governments enjoy under American law have not  been met in the Oregon case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is completely unacceptable and I urge everyone to contact the White House to express outrage over this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Don’t Ask Don’t Tell on the verge of repeal:&lt;/p&gt;

A universal flu vaccine is coming.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine have developed a new   influenza vaccine that brings science one step closer to a universal   influenza vaccine that would eliminate the need for seasonal flu shots.   The new findings can be found in the inaugural issue of &lt;em&gt;mBio&lt;/em&gt;®,   the first online, open-access journal published by the American Society   for Microbiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine the anti-vaxxers will have to pull an all-nighter to find a reason to oppose this. It’ll mean less vaccines for people and therefore Big Pharma producing a product that would mean people buying fewer vaccines–two things that squarely violate their narrative. Then again, they’ll probably insist that this is the vaccine that will ultimately kill us all.&lt;/p&gt;

This skill is not only important for making money playing poker but for social situations, relationships and everyday professional interactions.Recently, scientific interest in mindreading by looking others in the eye has increased, mainly within the context of ‘theory of mind’ – the general capacity to understand one’s own and other people’s mental states (e.g. emotions, desires, beliefs). A test that is commonly administered is the ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ test, which you can try yourself here. You may be surprised at how accurate your abilities are (I scored 26/36, which is considered within the normal range). But might it be possible that more experience can improve your score?A new study in press in the journal Neuropsychologia employed this test to study differences in abilities to mindread between younger and older individuals. Ilaria Castelli and colleagues used fMRI to study brain’s responses of 21-30 years olds versus 60-78 year olds during performance of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They found that young and old people did not differ in their abilities to understand mental states represented in the eyes, but the groups recruited different neural circuitry to complete the task. Some areas were activated only or more extensively in the younger group, and vice versa.So the results suggest that aging doesn’t help us understand others through the eyes. However, the researchers didn’t comment on controlling for amount of experience with people, which could be a factor that would lead to improvements in mindreading abilities. Also, since there were only 12 subjects in each group, the study doesn’t necessarily provide the final verdict on whether aging/experience can improve mindreading in the eyes. Nonetheless, the study may pave the way to more research on aging and theory of mind.Additionally, the study may provide insight to changes in the brain’s cognitive strategies as we age. Indeed some of the results appear to be in line with other fMRI studies on aging. For example, older subjects relied more on the frontal cortex, which is known to be more active in other cognitive tasks in elderly individuals.The authors also suggest that both groups used areas that are implicated in the (controversial) mirror neuron system devoted to empathy, but older people also recruited areas implicated in the mirror neuron system for language understanding. It should be understood, however, that the concepts and existences of these mirror neuron systems in humans are still subjects for debate.Even though I think some of the results should be interpreted cautiously, I’m still a fan of this study. By applying the study of theory of mind to aging, we may be able to gain insight to the brain’s aging process and the mechanism of cognitive decline. Theory of mind studies can teach us more than just things that are cool and interesting – practical applications could come about in the future.

The only reason we&amp;#39;re keeping him around is that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure he&amp;#39;s the feline anti-christ, and confining him to our house in Morris means he won&amp;#39;t be conquering the world any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He attempted a prison break today, though, and ran loose in the yard for a while. And what happened? He found a &lt;i&gt;baby bunny&lt;/i&gt;, killed it, and brought it back into the house. Then he gave me that "you're next" stare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm showing him this video now. I've told him that it's the mommy bunny, and she's joined the house guard, so he'd better not leave now.&lt;/p&gt;

The evidence for an event happening in the past is always going to be less than what we personally experience--&lt;b&gt;always!&lt;/b&gt; We know all to well about forgeries, faked evidence, and fraudulent claims to take anything at face value, especially when it comes to the past, and exponentially when it comes to some miraculous story in the ancient superstitious world. &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;German critic Gotthold Lessing (1729-1781) challenged us in this regard:&lt;blockquote&gt;We all believe that an Alexander lived who in a short time conquered almost all Asia....But it might still be possible that the story was founded on a mere poem of Choerilus just as the ten year siege of Troy depends on no better authority than Homer’s poetry. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/02/lessings-ugly-broad-ditch.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So why is it not the case that Mark's Gospel, the first one, was written as a work of fiction in the hopes of starting a religious movement of believers, or in providing a fictional story for an existing group of believers? I cannot discount this possibility, just as Lessing could not discount the possibility that Alexander did not conquer almost all Asia.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8668756491717427652?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How major? Andrew Wakefield, the de-licensed physician, himself will be there giving a talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing word of this protest, my friend &lt;a href="http://zenosarrow.blogspot.com/"&gt;Bruce Critelli &lt;/a&gt;(A/V ass kicker for the Women Thinking Free and Skepchicamp) emailed the WTF board and the old Skepchicamp planning crew to remind us that this shit doesn’t go down in our city on our watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tomorrow afternoon, Women Thinking Free volunteers are heading to Grant Park to do their part to help counter the deadly communicable BS being spread to the people of Chicago. We’ll be there to get the word out to any innocent bystanders who might be pulled in by conspiracy propaganda, and do what we can to spread the message of rationality, science and not killing kids with the fucking measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can be at Grant Park from 3-5pm, please be there! Contact me for information: &lt;a href="mailto:elyse(at)womenthinkingfree.org"&gt;elyse(at)womenthinkingfree.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help but have obligations preventing you from getting downtown tomorrow, contact me. We need help getting pamphlets and informational materials together. We also could use some help getting our informational website up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I’m at reduced capacity right now, so we need extra help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Why this is important&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please. Help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there will be free &lt;a href="http://surlyramics.com"&gt;SurlyRamics&lt;/a&gt; for everyone attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**UPDATE: Bruce and a few folks from WTF will be at the rally stage in Grant Park from 2-3pm. They will have informational fliers to hand out and Fliers for anyone who wants to help spread the word… unfortunately, the surlies and fliers are running on the late side and might not be there until after 3 when the rally starts.

Occasionally, he stopped to feed on some bluebells.They are Megachile willughbiella (thank you to eucera from WAB for confirming the ID). The males bear white and golden &amp;#39;boxing gloves&amp;#39; on their forelegs, which are enlarged concave-shaped furry tarsi, contain glands producing odor chemicals and are involved in mating.Males use the &amp;#39;gloves&amp;#39; as blind-folds: to cover the female&amp;#39;s eyes during mating. They also have various morphological modifications under their heads, mandibles and legs to hold and fold down the female&amp;#39;s antenna, head, wings and abdomen in position during mating, so that exposure to the odor glands is maximised. It is not entirely clear why the female should be blinded in such a way, and it has been suggested that the males effectively immobilise the female during mating and that the odors contribute to &amp;#39;calm&amp;#39; her.This drawing, taken from a figure in Wittmann and Blochtein&amp;#39;s work below) shows the position of the mating pair. The hatched parts are modified to aid during mating.Females, however, can and do repel advancing males. Sexually dimorphic forelegs of males appear in various bees (some leaf-cutter and carpenter bees) and many sphecid wasps, and are all used during mating to cover female eyes, suggesting a common function.More informationWittmann, D. and Blochtein, B.

Religious people tend to have worse understanding of science, and scientists are, of course, far less religious that the general population (probably because they start out that way, before they ever get to university).

We also know that religious people are much more likely to reject evolution. You think there's a connection here? Well, no doubt. But new research suggests that the connection runs deeper than you might assume.

Geoffrey Munro, of Towson University in Maryland, has shown that people who are confronted with scientific evidence that conflicts with their beliefs are more likely to reject science as a source of evidence. Rather than modifying their beliefs, they move the goalposts!

What he did was to show undergrads some brief research summaries that had been tweaked so that the results either supported or refuted the notion that homosexuality is linked to mental illness. Of course, for some of these undergrads the 'research' they were shown conflicted with their beliefs, and for some it supported their beliefs.

Then they were asked about what information sources they would turn to to help them decide about whether the US should have the death penalty. They could choose from scientific research (into whether or not it reduces violent crime, what the cost to taxpayers was, etc), or from a variety of subjective opinions: from crime experts (judges, prison wardens), or moralists (religious leaders, philosophers), families of victims, or supporters or opponents of the death penalty.

The results were clear. People who had just read research that conflicted with their beliefs about homosexuality were less likely to see the value of science in helping them decide about the death penalty.

And when they were asked to choose the one source they would turn to first, there was a dramatic drop in support for science - from 54.3% for people who's beliefs were previously confirmed by science, down to 24.4% for those whose beliefs were previously refuted.

This fits in with the attitudes of the religious towards evolution. There are a large number of Americans - some 30%, if you crunch the numbers -who understand the theory of evolution, but they simply reject it because it conflicts with their beliefs.

If Munro is right, then the inevitable consequence is that these people will also become sceptical of science in general.

And in case you're wondering whether these undergrads changed their beliefs towards homosexuals at all as a result of the scientific research they were shown (whether it conflicted or agreed with those beliefs), then the answer is "no". Not a jot!

Sadly, using the scientific impotence excuse in one domain seems to also increase the likelihood of applying it to science in general......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It still does. What’s the alternative? Guess-work based medicine? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quacks are fond of using cuddly words like ‘holistic’ and ‘integrative’, partly, one suspects, in an attempt to gain respectability and to disguise some of their barmier views. See, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466"&gt;Prince of Wales Foundation for magic medicine: spin on the meaning of ‘integrated’&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of evidence-based medicine are often accused by quacks of being hard-hearted calculators who want to take the soul out of medicine. Nothing could be further from the truth in my view. But I don’t practise medicine so it seemed to me to be worth quoting two of the best definitions I know, both from people at the sharp end of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;James Matthew May&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James May is a general practioner in London.  He is also chairman of &lt;a href="http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/"&gt;Healthwatch&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation that was exposing health fraud long before the recent explosion in the ‘skeptical blogosphere’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following passage was &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335#219657"&gt;written as comment&lt;/a&gt; (‘rapid reponse’) to an editorial in the &lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The editorial itself was (in my view) silly and misguided (&lt;em&gt;Closing the evidence gap in integrative medicine&lt;/em&gt;, by Hugh MacPherson, David Peters, and Catherine Zollman).  It is best forgotten as soon as possible.  But James May’s comment deserves to be preserved and publicised. The highlights in bold font are mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the term ‘integrative medicine’ in your editorial seems to confuse more than clarify the problem of ‘holism’ in medicine. Complementary therapists for example often use the term ‘holistic’ to blur the boundaries between the therapies used and the practitioner’s interpersonal skills. It would be better, however, to keep these distinctions clear. &lt;strong&gt;Caring is different from curing.&lt;/strong&gt; The point of RCTs is to establish how much of a treatment’s efficacy is independent of the ideas, concerns, and expectations of either the patient or the clinician. Using ‘multi-modal’ or ‘synergistic’ research methods is likely to confuse this important distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Holism’ is not a multifaceted approach to curing, it is a mulitfaceted approach to caring.&lt;/strong&gt; A truly holistic clinician will ‘cure sometimes, relieve often and comfort always’. Comforting may not produce a positive clinical outcome – but we should still do it. Historically speaking caring pre-existed effective medicine by millenia, but it was a principle motive for finding effective medicine. &lt;strong&gt;Caring therefore is not a subset of medicine, instead medicine is one of the tools used for caring. ‘Integrative medicine’ as a concept, however, blurs this boundary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been wisely observed that ‘if we keep trying to measure what we value, we will end up only valuing what we can measure.’ This particular ‘evidence gap’ is therefore probably best left; filled instead by caring doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. ‘Integrative medicine’ therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be ‘disintegrative medicine’.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Michael Baum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baum is a recently-retired cancer surgeon from UCLH. As well as being s surgeon with a strong interest in scientific medicine, he has been at the forefront of thinking about supportive or spiritual care of cancer patients. His 2009 Samuel Gee lecture is available in video, &lt;a href="https://admin.emea.acrobat.com/_a45839050/p69282078/"&gt;Concepts of Holism in Orthodox and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. It is a masterpiece. The conclusion puts his view bluntly (again the emphasis is mine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holism in medicine is an open ended and exquisitely complex understanding of human biology that over time has lead to spectacular improvements in the length and quality of life of patients with cancer. This approach encourages us to consider the transcendental as much as the cell and molecular biology of the human organism. &lt;strong&gt;Alternative versions of “holistic medicine” that offer claims of miracle cures for cancer by impossible dietary regimens, homeopathy or metaphysical manipulation of non-existent energy fields, are cruel and fraudulent acts that deserve to be criminalized.&lt;/strong&gt; Such “alternative” versions of holism are arid and closed belief systems, locked in a time warp, incapable of making progress yet quick to deny progress in the field of scientific medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if he doesn't accept it, he must be one of those nasty intolerant bigots who can't stand people with different political opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/waa_waa_waaaaa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/7to9NNQHZlo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274822210843"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=179616">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9ac2d029d70818c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="cheese"/><category term="microbial fuel cells"/><category term="whey powered fuel cells"/><title type="html">Cheese-Powered Cars?

The milk protein contains sugars that, when broken down by bacteria, actually release small amounts of energy. That energy can actually be harnessed in what are called microbial fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whey is produced in large quantities when making cheese, and the organic matter is actually considered an environmental hazard, forcing factories to pay for safe disposal. The use of whey for microbial fuel cells not only provides a great, natural alternative source of energy, but it also helps solve the problem of whey disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though whey-powered fuel cells aren’t efficient enough to run cars at this point, scientists are working on their design to improve efficiency. But the question remains: What about vegans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s part of &lt;a href="http://www.rom.on.ca/programs/lectures/index.php?ref=showinfo&amp;amp;program_id=5861"&gt;the announcement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;World renowned teacher, author and philosopher Deepak Chopra presents his latest concepts in the field of mind-body medicine bridging the technological miracles of the West with the wisdom of the East. He will show you how your highest vision of yourself can be turned into physical reality and discuss how you can become a living cell within the body of a living universe. You don’t join the cosmic dance – you become the dance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t make sense to you, there’s a good reason for it: &lt;em&gt;it doesn’t make sense&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra is perhaps the largest purveyor of pseudoscientific piffling pablum on the planet, and here is a museum — a science museum — paying him to speak. Non-ironically! Worse, check out how much they’re charging: $25 to $175! You can guess how much they’re lining Chopra’s pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;gag&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center for Inquiry (Canada) &lt;a href="http://www.cficanada.ca/blogs/entry/open_letter_to_the_royal_ontario_museum_inviting_quantum_mystic_deepak_chop/"&gt;has written an open letter to the museum&lt;/a&gt;, and I think they have handled the situation well. I hope they can distribute a lot of flyers at the event. Of course, people who pay that kind of money to hear such nonsense are unlikely to want to hear arguments against it, but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The fact that they are men is used to blind them to the fact that there are these other human beings called women out there who have just as much right to their lives as they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the opening paragraph of a &lt;a href="http://eivindberge.blogspot.com/2009/05/rape-is-equality.html"&gt;blog post by a self-proclaimed anti-feminist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When men have something women have less of, such as money or power, women simply take it by force. It's called affirmative action and feminists believe it's right. I am not going to argue against that. I accept that as a lost cause. So instead I am going to embrace forced equality and demand it for men as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do women have that men don't? Vaginas. So poor pathetic Eivend Berge is asserting his right to rape. He's quite open about it: &lt;span&gt;"it is about time men in feminist countries such as Norway stop thinking of rape as wrong"&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;"Rape is equality."&lt;/span&gt; You'll find his type is fairly common among a group who call themselves "Men's Rights" proponents, where Men's Right seems to be to maintain economic and social inequities that benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid he needs to learn that legal corrections to a long and ongoing history of economic oppression of women are fair and just, and not comparable to using violence to abuse and degrade and physically and emotionally harm women. I should also point out that women have lived with this fear of rape for essentially the entire history of the human race, so his self-serving manifesto isn't exactly novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to warp your perception of rotten males a little more, some of the comments there are all about giving him tips on improving his appearance to be a better pick up artist (PUA). Sometimes I'm really embarrassed by my gender. I'm also wondering now if the fact that we've got our oh-so-sensitive testicles dangling gently in a place just ripe for a savage kick isn't an example of cosmic justice, after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/you_can_tell_where_this_is_goi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/hc0SaQo1Km4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274816657479"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=14247">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1161ff6429065b48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Come on, Get Happy!</title><published>2010-05-25T19:00:29Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T19:00:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/ai-come-on-get-happy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5f059cab8f4e2267933e937b2ca89070&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just flew in from San Francisco and man my arms are tired.

It was seriously fan-freakin-tastic and I plan on doing a full post about the event later to fill you in on some of the creative awesomeness of the show. One of the makers even designed a commercial spacecraft and parked it in the building! And there were robots and steampunk exhibits and solar-powered insects and Adam Savage gave a talk and much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've written a couple of times about a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/a_confluence_of_the_anti-vaccine_and_hea.php"&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; to be held tomorrow in Grant Park that would be hilarious were it not an indication of the threat to public health that the anti-vaccine movement represents. Actually, it is to some extent hilarious, mainly due to the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_refusers_proving_oracs_corollary_to.php"&gt;anti-vaccine Poe-worthy "music"&lt;/a&gt; that will be the featured entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was bad enough that the fair city of Chicago would be blighted with this nonsense--and Andrew Wakefield, too--but now the "&lt;a href="http://www.americanpersonalrights.org"&gt;American Rally for Personal Rights&lt;/a&gt;" (a.k.a. the &lt;a href="http://www.americanpersonalrights.org"&gt;Autism One anti-vaccine rally featuring disgraced and unethical British physician Andy Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;) is now metastasizing. There are now "&lt;a href="http://americanpersonalrights.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=88&amp;amp;Itemid=81"&gt;satellite rallies&lt;/a&gt;" in &lt;a href="http://www.americanpersonalrights.org/images/rallyflyernj.pdf"&gt;Edison, NJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.americanpersonalrights.org/images/rallyflyernyc.pdf"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.americanpersonalrights.org/images/rallyflyerwa.pdf"&gt;Seattle Area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll just repeat again. Although the issue of how much power the state should have to compel vaccination is a legitimate political and social question, as I've pointed out before for Jenny McCarthy's "Green Our Vaccines" rally and this rally, it's really far more about being anti-vaccine than pro-freedom. The "health freedom" movement, of which the "no forced vaccination" movement is but a subset, is in reality far more about freedom for quacks to ply their quackery without any pesky interference from the government and for alt-med believers to use whatever quack nostroms or down whatever supplements they like, safety be damned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this week is likely to continue to be a very busy week on the anti-vaccine front.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_american_rally_for_personal_antivacc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Qx118gnTJDc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274814599564"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=179590">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b1da803f1fa9b6fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="funny videos"/><category term="Nike"/><category term="Nike ad"/><category term="Videos that Crack Us Up"/><category term="Write The Future"/><title type="html">Nike's "Write The Future" Ad: Videos That Crack Us Up</title><published>2010-05-25T19:00:56Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T19:00:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/nikes-write-the-future-ad-videos-that-crack-us-up/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nike’s new “Write The Future” ad campaign, directed by Alejandro Iñarritu (the director of “21 Grams” and “Babel”), dramatizes a world where football players make or break the dreams of their countries.

Today is the submission deadline, but I'm sure posts submitted tomorrow (the 26th) will also be considered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are inviting all posts that challenge pre-conceptions and mis-conceptions of who scientists/engineers are, what they look like, how they behave, what they do, etc. A cross-disciplinary examination of this issue is encouraged and posts about everything from the merging of art and science or science and faith, to posts that highlight social life to how people from well-represented groups are strong advocates of diversity initiatives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If she gets waved off, the next landing opportunity is at 10:22 EDT (14:22 UT). If &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t happen, it’ll be Thursday at 09:13 and 10:48 (and more chances on Friday if needed as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it for &lt;em&gt;Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll be fixed up and kept active in case it’s needed for a rescue mission for &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts133/index.html"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but if not, that’s the last flight. You can watch the landing live on &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt;, follow NASA &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/nasa"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and get more info at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html"&gt;the NASA shuttle website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out more of our exclusive video chat with Piper Kerman &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/yoga-and-fitness-behind-bars-personal-insights-from-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black-%E2%80%93-video-exclusive/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where she talks about staying fit behind bars.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At age 34, Piper Kerman went to  federal prison for a ten-year-old   drug smuggling and money laundering offense.  She spent 13 months in a   minimum-security correctional facility for  women in Danbury, CT, which   isn’t necessarily what you’d expect from a  blonde-haired, blue-eyed   Smith graduate and Red Sox fan from a nice, New  England family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper’s excellent memoir about her prison experience, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385523386?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=randohouseinc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385523386target="&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was just  published   by Random House – with back cover blurbs by Dave Eggers and  Elizabeth   Gilbert (not bad for a first-time writer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper sat down with Blisstree for the afternoon to discuss all    aspects of her time in the clink, from &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/exclusive-video-our-conversation-with-piper-kerman-author-of-orange-is-the-new-black/"&gt;skincare in prison&lt;/a&gt;, unexpected friendships, and discovering yoga, to the torturous six years she and her   now-husband spent in  limbo between her  conviction and the day she   self-surrendered in Danbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the 4th segment of our exclusive video interview with    Piper, where she shares the guilt and shame she felt for causing her loved ones pain during her prison ordeal, the forgiveness they offered, and the redemption she sought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keep it here for Piper’s next video, coming soon – we even got    Piper’s husband, Larry Smith of &lt;a href="http://www.smithmag.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;, to talk on camera about his  side of the story&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The name is Kringla Mobil, and it talks to the central mash-up database that collates information from museums and organisations all over the country. My Visby buddies Lars and Johan are driving forces in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just stepped out into my yard, pressed Kringla Mobil's map button and searched for &lt;i&gt;gravfält&lt;/i&gt;, &amp;quot;prehistoric cemetery&amp;quot;. Immediately I got a number of markers on the map: not all the cemeteries in the vicinity, but the ones for which the database contains some kind of media. Pressing the marker nearest my home, a cemetery belonging to the deserted hamlet of Kaknäs near Stockholm, I got a detailed map of the cemetery, the original of which is in the ATA archives in town, and a descriptive text derived from the sites &amp;amp; monuments register. Cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get Kringla Mobil, just search for it on the Android market on your handset and download it. And to participate in the development of the first full-fledged version, join the &lt;a href="http://www.kringla.info/forum/"&gt;Kringla Forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He was found to have falsified data, and now the British General Medical Council has given him the axe for unethical behavior, including subjecting children to unnecessary invasive procedures as part of his study.  Undoing the damage he has done is daily work for those of us on the front lines of medicine.  He of course has the unqualified support of the American antivax movement and and has taken up residence in Texas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Texas, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/texas_nurse_case/"&gt;the nurses in Winkler County &lt;/a&gt;who were fired and prosecuted for (properly) blowing the whistle on Dr. Rolando Arafiles are suing, and &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/7010378.html"&gt;the trial starts this fall&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://www.oaoa.com/news/nurses-47397-settlement-lawsuit.html"&gt;The hospital has already been fined&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the case, and a Texas TV station is reporting that&lt;a href="http://www.cbs7kosa.com/news/details.asp?ID=19372"&gt; Arafiles is being fined&lt;/a&gt; and put on probation by the state medical board.  Arafiles may be running out of places to practice. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/02/more_details_emerge_on_texas_d.php"&gt; He&amp;#39;s already surrendered his license in New York State,&lt;/a&gt; and given his history, he may eventually wear out his welcome in Texas.  But Texas is pretty close to Arizona, and he can always get&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/more_on_legalized_quackery_in_arizona.php"&gt; a license as a homeopath down there.&lt;/a&gt; Maybe he can take correspondence courses from Dana Ullman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/Qex_gJhHUmw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274809224996"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=35429">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/493a63640b77efc4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Price Fishback"/><category term="welfare"/><title type="html">Who Spends More on Social Welfare: the United States or Sweden?</title><published>2010-05-25T16:00:17Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T16:00:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/UDAx3j8Rc9s/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/who-spends-more-on-social-welfare-the-united-states-or-sweden/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A guest post from Price Fishback.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/UDAx3j8Rc9s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEVEN D.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Army wants to do comprehensive blood tests for syphilis, a relatively rare disease, but each individual test is expensive. How can they test everyone more cheaply?

&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: mix the blood of $g$ individuals together, and test that. A positive outcome indicates that at least one person in the group has syphilis, and a negative outcome indicates that no person in the group has it. In the event of a positive outcome, test all the members of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let $p$ be the probability that a randomly-chosen person has syphilis, and let $N$ be the population size. What is the optimal size for the group? Choose $g$ too small, and you end up doing lots of tests, because $N/g$ (the number of groups) is large. Choose $g$ too large, and it becomes very likely that testing the group will be positive, so you end up doing lots of tests again. Somewhere in between is the optimal choice of $g$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result, after a bit of algebra, is that one must choose $g$ to minimize&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ \frac{1}{g} + 1 - (1 - p)^g. $$&lt;/p&gt;

From Farlow et al, 2010.

Time and again I have stressed that every fossil bone tells a story, and, in a different way, so do coprolites. They are small snapshots of a moment in the life of an organism, often preserving bits of their meals, and while they may not get top billing in museum halls, they are among the most pungent reminders that weird and wonderful organisms really did live during the remote past. As reported by paleontologists James Farlow, Karen Chin, Anne Argast, and Sean Poppy in the latest issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, two such vestiges of ancient digestive systems have recently been found in Indiana, but what left them is something of a mystery.

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Karyn Hede to answer a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Karyn Hede pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Karyn%20Hede%20pic.jpg" width="298" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;I think of myself as a scientist who writes, even though I jumped out of research after graduate school. Most of my formal education is in science. I was biology/chemistry major and then studied &lt;a href="http://genetics.unc.edu/" title=""&gt;genetics in graduate school at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. I should have known I would end up a science communicator though. As an undergraduate, I performed in a "chemistry magic show." We would go around to elementary and middle schools and get kids involved in the show. It was fantastic to see kids get engaged and to realize that science can be fun.  After I committed to making the switch to writing about science and medicine, I studied journalism at UNC-CH. This was well before the &lt;a href="http://www.jomc.unc.edu/medicaljournalism" title=""&gt;medical journalism program&lt;/a&gt; existed. I was the oddball. I like to think I helped plant the seed for that program. I've spent my whole career telling stories about medicine, science and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first professional writing gig was for a local publication called &lt;a href="http://triangle.bizjournals.com/triangle/" title=""&gt;Triangle Business Journal&lt;/a&gt;. I talked the editor into letting me write personality profiles of local scientists. My first interview was with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Hitchings" title=""&gt;George Hitchings&lt;/a&gt;, of the [now defunct] Burroughs Wellcome Co., who had just won the Nobel Prize in Medicine. He was so gracious, and I was so nervous! Many years later, I was working as communications officer at the &lt;a href="http://www.bwfund.org/" title=""&gt;Burroughs Wellcome Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a post now occupied by the inestimable Russ Campbell, when Dr. Hitchings passed away. We went over to the old Burroughs Wellcome offices to collect some of his memorabilia for display. They had his personal scrapbook there - he had cut out the article I wrote and put it in his scrapbook.  That remains one of the best compliments I've ever been paid as a writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was senior science writer at &lt;a href="http://www.dukehealth.org/" title=""&gt;Duke Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; for four years. I learned how to put together broadcast-quality video and how to organize and run a news conference. It was a hectic job, and I spent a lot of my time responding to media requests. I discovered I prefer to be on the other side of the equation. I like to be the one asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am a news correspondent for &lt;a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/" title=""&gt;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; and for the journal Science's &lt;a href="http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/" title=""&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt; site. I also write for magazines and science organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undercurrent within my work has always been career development for scientists. When I was a graduate student, you were pretty much on your own as far as exploring career options and developing professional skills. I enjoy teaching and helping support the next generation of scientists. In the last couple of years I have done some consulting work with the North Carolina Biotechnology Center to promote professional science masters programs with the state. We organized a meeting around the issue in 2008.  I've also been working with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_6.php" title=""&gt;Russ Campbell&lt;/a&gt; on a series of professional development booklets for scientists. Recently, I started teaching scientific writing for biomedical graduate students at UNC. I taught two courses, one for first-year students and a second course I developed for students who are working their first grant or their dissertation. It's my way of giving back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also into gardening and the local food movement. I subscribe to a local CSA at &lt;a href="http://maplespringgardens.com/" title=""&gt;Maple Spring Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. A few years ago I organized a session at the &lt;a href="http://www.nasw.org/" title=""&gt;National Association of Science Writers&lt;/a&gt; meeting to get science writers more interested in covering how our food is produced. Since then, the topic has gotten a lot of coverage, with &lt;a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/" title=""&gt;Michael Pollan'&lt;/a&gt;s fantastic books and all the concern over outbreaks of food-borne disease. I'd love to write more about the intersection of science and food production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the wave of the future in science communication is going to be scientists engaging directly with people through their own blogs, videos and websites. Some people (like you!) are naturals and don't need any help. I know scientists who would like to move more into this arena, but don't know how to get started. I'd like to work with scientists to help them develop those communication and storytelling skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read blogs and have gotten story ideas from blogs. I don't have a blog (yet). I like to let ideas percolate for awhile before writing. The thought of having to produce coherent posts every day (or nearly so) is a bit daunting. My Facebook connections are mostly old friends from college and family. I like &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/karynhede" title=""&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; for work-related networking - it's a bit more professional and I like having more control over the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool science blogs by the participants at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in Washington state for several years and moved back to North Carolina a couple of years ago. In my absence, I discovered an enthusiastic on-line science blogging community had grown up here. I wasn't surprised. This has always been a science-rich area - blogging is just the latest incarnation of the local science communications community, but with a much wider reach now. I read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;your blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/" title=""&gt;Drugmonkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Female Science Professor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;The Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Terra Sigillata&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first time attending ScienceOnline. I was impressed with the sessions and particularly the workshops on Fri.  The sessions on visualization in science were valuable, because I was teaching at the time and was able to gather a lot of incredible resources for my students. Meeting so many interesting people who are inventing the future of science communication was great. I'd love to see more of a mashup of working scientists and science communicators shaping the agenda next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope you can come again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scienceonline2010_-_interview_48.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/RlFJL7QfFGQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274801363742"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=24789">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8722e4e06c9626a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">A Christian Asks for Help in Planning a Funeral for an Atheist</title><published>2010-05-25T15:00:19Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T15:00:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/25/a-christian-asks-for-help-in-planning-a-funeral-for-an-atheist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a very sad email from a Christian woman who could really could use some advice.  I don’t know any more information that what is written below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My daughter’s biological father committed suicide late last week and as she is next of kin but only 8 yrs. old it is up to me to settle his affairs. I’m Christian but he was an Atheist and I do not want a Christian service for him as I know he would not have wanted one. Do you have any advice on how to plan this out? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just going to have a graveside service and it will be less than 30 people, probably… Any thoughts/ideas would be much appreciated… the service will be some time early next week.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My immediate suggestion is to just refrain from making references to a god in the eulogy.  Or perhaps she could request donations to his favorite charity/non-profit in lieu of flowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other ideas?&lt;br&gt;

Here's my calendar for the next few months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=119871101383960"&gt;Oslo on 16 June&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://atheistconvention.eu/"&gt;Copenhagen on 18-20 June&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/"&gt;Lindau on 26 June-1 July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=62279163619"&gt;Minneapolis and Convergence/Skepchick Con 1-3 July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vancouver, BC on 30 July&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fargo, ND atheist convention on 17-20 September&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheribourg, Quebec for RiboClub on 20-22 September&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montreal, AAI convention on 1-3 October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LA, Secular humanism conference on 7-10 October (I'll be on a panel with Chris Mooney, discussing accommodation vs. confrontation. Uh-oh.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico City on a date in October to be determined&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;London, The Amazing Meeting, on 16-17 October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springfield, Missouri for &lt;a href="http://skepticon.org/"&gt;Skepticon III&lt;/a&gt; on 19-20 November&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle, possibly, sometime in November&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's it. I'm pleased that I managed to keep this time right around now free to get some work done, and then there's a flurry of European travel in mid- to late June, and August is free so I can get prepared for teaching. But otherwise, that's it, I'm staying home. I'm &lt;i&gt;discouraging&lt;/i&gt; everyone from sending me more invitations until the Spring term. If you really want me to visit Miami or Hawaii in February, I might be coaxed out of my hermitage, but that's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't complain, I know I'm turning into a regular J.D. Salinger here. Now go away and leave me alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/im_a_stay-at-home_kind_of_guy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yC5mlOENWK8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274800685927"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/west-central_new_york_represen.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0cc5f37b8d847ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">West-Central New York, represent!</title><published>2010-05-25T14:40:02Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T14:40:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Ikix1vOGmsg/west-central_new_york_represen.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/west-central_new_york_represen.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have spent more time there on my trips to Rochester and Syracuse — it seems that &lt;a href="http://www.freethought-trail.org/index.php"&gt;region was also a hotbed of freethought&lt;/a&gt;.

The New Kurtz is a more timid observer, who wants to criticize religion mildly without giving offense, and is more concerned about policing his fellow humanists and atheists than actually working to overcome the folly of religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest issue of Free Inquiry magazine, Kurtz has an editorial that is all about tone rather than content; it de-emphasizes what we say and wants to make how we say it the most important criterion. It&amp;#39;s titled &amp;quot;Toward a Kinder and Gentler Humanism&amp;quot;, and it makes me wonder who chopped Kurtz&amp;#39;s balls off. (To be fair, I should say upfront that it briefly mentions me — or rather, my jerkwad alter ego, P.Z. Meyers — to accuse me of being &amp;quot;strident&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He lays out his plan. They are going to take the "high road", they are not "shrill", they will not "resort to ridicule", yadda yadda yadda. Again, tone, tone, tone. Who cares? The low point for me, though, was this bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must say, though some colleagues at the Center may disagree, that I have serious misgivings about recent programs undertaken by the Center and the Council that laid heavy stress on blasphemy. Although I agree that it is vitally important to defend the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; to blaspheme, I am displeased with the Center's decision last year to celebrate Blasphemy Day as such. Similarly, although cartoons make a point and can be used, I am disturbed about poking fun at our fellow citizens in the public square. Speaking personally, I am particularly offended by the cartoon that won the Council's Free Expression Cartoon Contest this year. I think that it is in poor taste. I do not object to others in society doing this, but I do not think that is is the role of the Council for Secular Humanism or the Center for Inquiry to engage in such forms of lampooning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we're going to reserve the right to blaspheme, but we're not actually going to do it, out of respect for the beliefs of others. When some religious nut demands our obeisance to something he regards as holy, we're going to say that we &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; disagree, but instead we&amp;#39;re going to self-censor and bend a knee to his gods…have no fear, though, while we&amp;#39;re busy kowtowing, we&amp;#39;ll be sure to declare that we could stop any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have not protected the right to blaspheme if you also gag yourself and say you won't; you are particularly in the wrong if you are a respected leader of a godless institution and you use your influence to insist that we should not blaspheme at all. It is our responsibility as the opposition to poke fun at our fellow citizens in the public square; what good is an opposition that muzzles itself and insists on giving religion the privilege of not even being laughed at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/05/what_ever_happened_to_paul_kur/fe_winner20.jpg" width="200" height="174" alt="fe_winner20.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, here is that cartoon that won the contest he referred to above. I share some of Kurtz&amp;#39;s disappointment, because I don&amp;#39;t care for it much. However, it&amp;#39;s not because it&amp;#39;s offensive or in poor taste — please, a cartoon cannot possibly be as offensive as the child-raping behavior it targets — but because it&amp;#39;s not particularly funny. I have higher expectations of one of the premiere organizations for secular humanism than this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Kurtz fails to appreciate is that we &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; offend. We are rejecting the power of invisible gods and refusing the promise of eternal life in paradise, and further, we're in the business of telling believers that their most cherished fantasies are lies. If we aren't offending them, we are hiding the implications of our ideas and are not doing our job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as the editorial reveals throughout, the Council for Secular Humanism and the Center for Inquiry are defying their founder's demands that they hobble themselves (and there is definitely a note of resentment coming through, too). It's a shame that Kurtz is willingly trapped in an ineffectual past, but at the same time, I think he has built a solid foundation for those organizations, and there is hope that they, if not their former leader, are working to advance.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if a guy won fame for his action movies, people will listen to his advice on carbon sequestration, and go out an buy his brand of shoe. That&amp;#39;s not logical, but it does follow a predictable rule, which is that being famous, &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; and/or prestigious gives you ready access to the minds of others. That bias may have evolved a very long time ago, according to this paper in the journal PLoS One last week. Prestige, it reports, sways chimpanzees the same way it does people.

The authors—Victoria Horner, Darby Proctor, Kristin E. Bonnie, Andrew Whiten and Frans de Waal—taught a novel game to members of two chimpanzee troops that live at the Yerkes Primate Research Center near Atlanta.  In one troop, Georgia, a high-ranking female, was taught to put plastic tokens into a polka-dotted receptacle to win a treat; the same routine, except with a striped receptacle, was taught to Tara, an ape nobody, who was low on the totem pole of social rank. (Chimp troops, like military units or Condé Nast magazines, operate with a very clear, harshly enforced pecking order.)  In the other group, the learners were high-ranking Ericka and low-ranking Julianne.

As each one went through her routine, others watched and soon learned it. Many decided to get in on the action. Practically, there was no difference between imitating Georgia and imitating Tara, as the tasks and reward were identical. But the chimps much preferred to follow the high-ranking Georgia: 70 percent of the tokens they collected went into her bin. The difference between high and low status was even more marked in the second group, where 90 percent of the tokens went where Ericka was putting hers.

In a social animal, the authors conclude, learning depends on prestige.  Among chimps in the wild, they write, innovations probably won&amp;#39;t spread unless they have the equivalent of a celebrity endorsement—that is, unless they are introduced by someone high in rank.

So perhaps celebrity influence isn&amp;#39;t a peculiarity of our times, but rather a trick evolution has played on us. For eons, imitating the &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; guy was probably a very good bet for a social primate, because &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; meant he was doing something right (being the best tracker, being the son of the top female) and therefore getting more food, sex and protection than the average schlub.

Civilization makes fine distinctions between kinds of prestige—we don&amp;#39;t expect Nobel-winning physicists to be good at basketball, or Tiger Woods to play like Sonny Rollins—but elsewhere in the mind, all prestige is still the same.

That might explain why &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t a quality the authorities can control (a fact that greatly irritates the sort of people who put themselves in charge of others&amp;#39;   morals).  In her fascinating book Outcasts, for instance, Ruth Mellinkoff quotes a sermon preached in Germany in 1272: &amp;quot;You are not satisfied that almighty God has given you a choice  of colors such as red, blue, white, green, yellow, and black for your clothing. No, in your arrogance you have cut your clothes into pieces—here putting red in the white, there yellow in the green, another is striped; this one motley, that dark brown ... This arrogance never ends, for as soon as someone discovers a new fashion, all of you must try it!&amp;quot;

At the time, it was soldiers who slashed up their sleeves and wore multiple patches—&amp;quot;pied&amp;quot; clothing, like the &amp;quot;Pied Piper&amp;quot; sported.  In other words, while respectable burghers talked up examples of responsibility and piety, their children were more impressed by the medieval European equivalent of &amp;quot;gangstas.&amp;quot;

Chimps live with a single social hierarchy, but people live with two. One is civilization&amp;#39;s official pecking order, which values the mathlete valedictorian more highly than the studly dropout.  The other pecking order gives top status to whoever is getting attention, sex and other goodies right now—never mind how.  As most of us remember from high school, this intuitive hierarchy is hard to resist.  If you had to choose, who would you follow around collecting tokens to win a banana—Angelina Jolie or Carol W. Greider?

Diseases that disproportionately affect sub-Saharan Africa are not exactly priorities for drug companies. But they pose a tremendous unmet need. Especially malaria, which kills an unbelievable 800,000 people every year, has fought back against almost every traditional drug. The fight against the disease has boiled down to one class of drugs- the artemisinins. If the parasite develops resistance against these, nobody knows how fast and wide it will spread.Since pharma companies often get bad press for neglecting....neglected diseases, this makes the duo of papers in this week&amp;#39;s issue of Nature especially impressive. The papers talk about GSK collaborating with a host of academic laboratories to discover literally hundreds of hits against malaria through phenotypic screening. The sheer multidisciplinary effort put into this endeavor is laudable. Phenotypic screening is an effective method for drug discovery since it does not care about the target of a drug, at least in the beginning. It&amp;#39;s a more top down approach that complements bottom-up rational drug design. The goal is to simply watch out for a particular kind of response, which could be anything from fluorescence to cell shrinkage. In this case it was 80% inhibition of growth of the parasite in the asexual stage in red blood cells. Target identification can come later.The company screened its proprietary collection of about 2 million compounds. The compound library was chosen for diversity of scaffolds and novel chemotypes. The assay looked for 80% inhibition of the P. falciparum parasite, and came up with hundreds of diverse compounds. The scientists seemed to have taken due care to minimize false positives. They sought to eliminate promiscuous, lipophilic compounds from the list. They also screened their compounds against well known targets and processes that the malarial parasite exploits to subdue its host. One of these was particularly eye-opening for me; apparently, the insidious little weasel can hack up the amino acids from hemoglobin molecules in the host to assemble its own proteins. Now that&amp;#39;s stealth for you. More interestingly, the group then screened the selected molecules against seven novel malarial targets and found encouraging inhibition profiles against these targets. Infectious disease are best treated when you can hit the causative agent in multiple places. Paucity of targets has especially been an issue for malaria and TB, and these chemotypes along with their suggested targets provide promising leads. As a final act, the first paper co-authored by Guiguemde et al. also demonstrates favorable pharmacokinetic properties for one of their hits.Especially interesting is the report in the second paper authored by Gamo et al. where the authors follow a similar procedure but discover that the novel target list for the purported antimalarial candidates is enriched in kinases. They take due care to investigate that this enrichment is not a chance enrichment. Unlike the human genome which has about 500 kinases, the malarial genome has about 80. But finding kinases among the targets of these novel chemotypes has rich implications, since kinases have already been intensely investigated, the targets are well-understood and there are literally thousands of kinase inhibitors out there waiting to be tested. Testing kinase inhibitors against malaria would open up a whole new chapter for antimalarial drug discovery.Finally, and this is the kicker most talked about, GSK has made the entire list of hits freely available to the public. This is a very laudable act. In an age where corporations are routinely derided for their emphasis on secrecy and profit-making, such a decision should drive home the good work that corporations can potentially do. It also underscores the tremendous opportunities for drug discovery against neglected diseases gained from academic-corporate collaboration. While it remains to be seen how many of these promising candidates become bona fide drugs, it provides many promising starting points for further efforts. Malaria is about as insidious a disease as you can have, lurking in the shadows and waiting to pounce on you. The more the hands that try to squeeze its neck, the better.Guiguemde, W., Shelat, A., Bouck, D., Duffy, S., Crowther, G., Davis, P., Smithson, D., Connelly, M., Clark, J., Zhu, F., Jiménez-Díaz, M., Martinez, M., Wilson, E., Tripathi, A., Gut, J., Sharlow, E., Bathurst, I., Mazouni, F., Fowble, J., Forquer, I., McGinley, P., Castro, S., Angulo-Barturen, I., Ferrer, S., Rosenthal, P., DeRisi, J., Sullivan, D., Lazo, J., Roos, D., Riscoe, M., Phillips, M., Rathod, P., Van Voorhis, W., Avery, V., &amp;amp; Guy, R.

The answer? Yes (according to most scientific studies).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Most of  you guessed correctly. Now see if you know the answer to our  next breast cancer quiz (and check back for the answer):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About &lt;a href="http://ww5.komen.org/"&gt;Susan G. Komen for the     Cure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Susan G. Komen fought breast cancer with her heart, body, and     soul. Throughout her diagnosis, treatments, and endless days in the     hospital, she spent her time thinking of ways to make life better for     other women battling breast cancer instead of worrying about her own     situation. That concern for others continued even as Susan neared the     end of her fight. Moved by Susan’s compassion for others and committed     to making a difference, Nancy G. Brinker promised her sister that  she    would do everything in her power to end breast cancer forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That promise is now Susan G. Komen for the Cure®, the global     leader of the breast cancer movement, having invested nearly $1.5     billion since its inception in 1982. As the world’s largest grassroots     network of breast cancer survivors and activists, we’re working   together   to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all,   and   energize science to find the cures. Thanks to events like the   Susan G.   Komen Race for the Cure®, and generous contributions from our   partners,   sponsors, and fellow supporters, we have become the  largest  source of   nonprofit funds dedicated to the fight against  breast  cancer in the   world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time of year, it seems everything on the top of our minds starts with an “s”: Summer, surf, sun, and skin. And the “s” we really don’t want you to forget before frolicking in the waves? Sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a lot to consider when choosing your sunscreen; it’s not as simple as choosing a high SPF or a pretty package. Before you grab any old bottle of UV blocker off the drugstore shelf, we have a shopping checklist to make sure you get the best pick for your skin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. SPF&lt;/strong&gt; – According the the Environmental Working Group, the difference between an SPF 50 and an SPF 110 is incredibly small. Also, people who choose a sunblock with a higher SPF use it as an excuse to not reapply as often as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vitamin A &lt;/strong&gt;- Though we love to load up on vitamins, it turns out this is one that we should avoid, at least in our sunscreens. Vitamin A, in a form called retinyl palmitate, may actually accelerate the development of skin cancer. Retinyl palmitate is present in about 40% of sunscreens on the market today – check your label before you buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Minerals&lt;/strong&gt; – Some say the best form of skin protection might be “mineral blockers” like zinc or titanium oxide, which block UV rays. There’s some debate about whether the nanoparticles are safe (some say they can penetrate skin), but if you choose to go with a mineral blocker, go with one that contains avobenzone, which blocks UVA and UVB rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the FDA will help clarify ll of this confusing information will soon be rectified: the FDA is approving a new sunscreen labeling system that will this be enacted this October. Not quite in time for summer, but we’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;

You get used to it after a while… then something like this’ll slap you upside the head: a star that exploded more than 5000 years ago launched two epic bullets. One is a cloud of gas screaming away at thousands of kilometers per second, and the other is the cinder of the star itself, an octillion-ton cannonball blasting through space in a totally different direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chandra.harvard.edu/graphics/resources/desktops/2010/n49_1920.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/chandra_n49.jpg" alt="chandra_n49" title="chandra_n49" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a composite picture of the supernova remnant N49: an expanding lumpy sphere of gas about 30 light years across (300 trillion kilometers, or 180 trillion miles)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#n49footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to our Milky Way. The blue in the picture is the emission from gas heated to millions of degrees, and shows X-rays detected by the Chandra observatory. The yellow and purple are from Hubble data, showing gas being whipped and beaten by shock waves slamming around insides the remnant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn your attention to the little blue blob to the right, marked by the red arrow. It’s outside the main bubble of the nebula, meaning that it must be moving faster than the gas in general. This is seen sometimes in supernovae remnants: a bullet or focused blob of gas screaming away. It may be caused by magnetic fields in the expanding gas just after the star explodes, launching the octillions of tons of matter away in all directions, or it may be due to focusing from shock waves, which can sculpt the gas and create little pockets of denser knots.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Either way, this bullet is moving away from the nebula at speeds of more than 2200 km/sec (1300 miles per second) — &lt;em&gt;fast enough to cross the United States in less than 3 seconds&lt;/em&gt;. The mass of the blob is unclear, but to give you an idea of the energies involved,&lt;strong&gt; it emits 10 times the Sun’s total energy in just X-rays alone&lt;/strong&gt;. Incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now focus your attention to the star-like point source indicated by the other red arrow, near the top of the remnant. The astronomers &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0211552"&gt;took a good look at that object&lt;/a&gt;, which was previously known to be an object called SGR 0526−66. SGR stands for &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;oft &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;amma ray &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;epeater, an object that periodically blasts out flashes of super-high-energy gamma rays. SGRs are neutron stars, the ultra-compact and überdense (I know, I’m running out of adjectives.. but just you wait…) leftover cores of stars that have exploded. They can have more than the mass of the Sun compressed down into a ball just a few kilometers across! A cubic centimeter of neutron star material (usually called &lt;em&gt;neutronium&lt;/em&gt;, a word I love love love) weighs about as much as the combined weight of all the cars in the United States. So there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astronomers found the age of the SGR to be a few thousand years, which matches the age of the nebula! That means it’s very likely this is the leftover core of the star that exploded and created N49 itself. But what’s it doing way off center? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers think that sometimes the explosion can be off-center in the star, so that things don’t quite expand the same in all directions. Given the energies involved (hint: a &lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt;) this can give the neutron star a kick, sending it caroming through space at high velocity. If SGR 0526-66 is indeed the leftover cinder from the explosion, to get where it is in the time since the explosion it has to be moving at a velocity of at least 790 km/sec (490 miles/second). Think about that: this is an object with the mass of the Sun and it got kicked so hard it went shooting off &lt;em&gt;hundreds of times faster than a rifle bullet.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you might want to sit for a moment and soak that in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse! Since it’s seen in the Chandra data, that means it’s hot. Glowing at several million degrees, the energy it gives off in just X-rays &lt;em&gt;is a hundred times the Sun’s total energy production!&lt;/em&gt; If you replaced the Sun with SGR 0526-66, you’d barely be able to see it since it’s so small, but it would hardly matter: the X-rays it gives off would cook the Earth like a marshmallow in a furnace. If that’s not enough awesome for you, the magnetic field at the surface of the neutron star is about 100 trillion times stronger than the Earth’s!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neutron stars are small in stature, but nothing else about them is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying supernovae remnants is interesting scientifically for lots of reasons, not the least of which is that they create the heavy elements in the Universe, so we literally owe our lives to them. That would be enough… but I know that secretly, astronomers study them because they are simply so frakkin’ cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it’s not so secret.&lt;/p&gt;

Frauds at work.

Science is not about PR, Mooney.

You and your ilk make me feel both ill, and embarassed to say I am a scientist.

You should go crawl back under your rock.
To which Aileen Pincus, who also does media training, ably replied:
There’s no question that science is losing the public relations battle, so it’s interesting to me to still find scientists like the poster above who obviously believe that learning to communicate the science somehow harms the science. Yes, those who apply science commercially don’t suffer from such delusions, and they’re a good many of my clients. Others however, come to understand the real world of how science in funded only after long, losing struggles. Public support for science, essential to that funding, isn’t something to be scorned–and that can only happen when scientists learn how to talk to non-scientists.
Indeed--and that is only one of the reasons that many scientists are interested in having such trainings. I believe a lot of it has to do with the nastiness of the evolution and climate wars, and the sense that we have been ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F05%2F25%2Fsci-comm-training%2F" width="100%" height="60" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274797210949"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=35401">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95eebcdba645f17d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="psychology"/><title type="html">Time Flies?</title><published>2010-05-25T13:50:20Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T13:50:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/xCy1T8VV9A4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/time-flies/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Does time fly as we age?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/xCy1T8VV9A4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By FREAKONOMICS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274796892309"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=14244">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d848845c23a99f42</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 5.25</title><published>2010-05-25T13:15:22Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T13:15:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/05/skepchick-quickies-5-25/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume that, being bloggers and blog-readers, you all know who Cory is and what he does - if not, follow the links above as this post is going to be self-centered ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I got to meet Cory in person, but he is pretty important person in my life. After I have been blogging about politics for a couple of years and &lt;a href="http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; started being well known in the circles of the progressive blogosphere, Kerry/Edwards ticket lost and we all sunk into a collective state of depression. I wrote a few election post-mortems but the wind was out of my sails and I was tired of political blogging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started &lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;a new blog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know.html" title=""&gt;January 2005&lt;/a&gt; and posted a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/06/everything_you_always_wanted_t.php" title=""&gt;longish blog post about circadian rhythms and sleep in humans&lt;/a&gt;. I installed Sitemeter on that one-post blog and went to sleep, only to wake up in the morning to an avalanche of traffic - coming from BoingBoing, linked to by Cory. Soon others linked to it as well, e.g., Andrew Sullivan. To this day, this is still one of the most visited posts in my blogging career and at least once a year it gets rediscovered by someone on digg, redditt or stumbleupon which brings in another mini-avalanche of traffic to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a wake-up call and an Eureka moment. Aha! Everyone can bash Bush and Cheney, but not everyone can write about science from a position of expertise! I can! On that day I became a science blogger. I knew a handful of science blogs at the time - Intersection, Loom, Pharyngula, Deltoid...but really, the space was still wide open at that time. Very soon, my science blog was receiving as high traffic as the political one, although I kept it very narrowly focused on just chronobiology - talk about a niche blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later, I was invited to join Scienceblogs.com which widened my audience and enabled me to organize the first science blogging conference (now known as ScienceOnline) and to put together the first science blogging anthology (Open Laboratory 2006). This broadened my audience even more and put my name out there into the media, the science publishing world and Science 2.0 world. As a blogger whose academic library password expired, I naturally became a proponent of Open Access and tended to blog a lot about PLoS papers because I could access them. All of this led to a job at PLoS &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/05/its_official_1.php" title=""&gt;which I got in the comments of a blog post&lt;/a&gt; of mine. That job then led to many other opportunities - speaking invitations, two trips to Europe, various consulting gigs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a single link from someone like Cory can completely alter one's career trajectory. Just saying. Never hold your links back, you never know how that can help a person one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you never know what exactly on your blog is interesting to other people. Cory says he loves the Clock Quotes. Go figure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I took a few murky photos at the reading - under the fold:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/cory_doctorow_in_chapel_hill.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/cory_doctorow_in_chapel_hill.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/flnOHPy_Hik" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274795775723"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=179479">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3c5a26540f31c8d7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="amFAR"/><category term="celebrity charities"/><category term="Cinema Against AIDS"/><category term="Mary J.

or&lt;em&gt; heimweg&lt;/em&gt; "way home"?)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The English translations are mine, and therefore not to be relied on, since I know little German and less Dutch.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this particular selection of words tells us something about the Dutch national character, though I'm generally skeptical of such linguistic tea-leaf reading. For me, the real sign of Netherlandic otherness is the fact that this question was asked (and answered!) in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no glossy popular magazine in English anything like &lt;a href="http://onzetaal.republisher.modernmedia.nl/Onze-Taal-E-paperpagina/40497/34413/2008-01.html#ep34413=0"&gt;Onze Taal&lt;/a&gt;. But if there were, it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine its editors asking readers for their favorite words in some nearby language (Spanish, French, Dutch, etc.). And it&amp;#39;s even harder to imagine them getting such a large number of responses — if we were to scale the response rate according to the ratio between the overall U.S. and Netherlands populations (about 309 million to 17 million), their 3,358 responses would scale to more than 60,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of this difference, of course, is that the Netherlands is a small country whose citizens need to learn their neighbors' languages in order to prosper.  But the fact that the difference is easy to explain doesn't change the fact that the difference exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these large differences don't prevent &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004519.html"&gt;Dutch and Flemish linguistic nationalism&lt;/a&gt; from having surprising similarities to the U.S. "English Only" movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in the Flemish- (i.e. Dutch-) speaking regions of Belgium, there's an on-going argument about whether the French-speaking linguistic minority should be made to learn Dutch in order to deal with the local government, to send their children to school in Dutch, and so on, despite the fact that Belgium is officially a bilingual country. In fairness to the Flemish, I gather that they feel that the situation is asymmetrical, in that a larger proportion of native Flemish speakers are competent in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, the main linguistic controversy deals with &lt;a href="http://esr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/2/169"&gt;immigrants&lt;/a&gt; — mainly from Morocco and Turkey — who don&amp;#39;t assimilate well in to the larger society, and similarly don&amp;#39;t learn Dutch very well.  Since 2006, would-be immigrants need to pass a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1067418.html"&gt;civic-integration examination&lt;/a&gt;" as well as a Dutch language test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominant worry in the U.S. has to do with the status of Spanish, where the situation is a sort of mixture of the Flemish/French and Dutch/other conflicts. Like French with respect to Flemish, Spanish is the language of nearby countries, whose speakers have been in the general area at least as long as the English speakers have. But like the Dutch with respect to Turkish and Arabic, relatively few U.S. native speakers of English are competent in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all of these situations have in common is that language differences align with ethnic differences, in a situation with considerable (and perhaps increasing) ethnic diversity in a given geographical area. Given that alignment, the amount of bilingualism or multi-lingualism seems to be secondary in determining whether controversies will arise about the use of minority languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on "&lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/strange-tongue/201005/the-folly-english-only"&gt;The folly of English-only&lt;/a&gt;" at Psychology Today, Derek Bickerton raises the example of Switzerland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;I know one country that&amp;#39;s had hardly any trouble, inside or out, for several centuries. And … not merely does that country allow guns–it mandates that all men of military age have guns in their homes, and ammunition, and that they be ready to use them at a moment&amp;#39;s notice. Just like the old Minutemen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to hear from some people who are more familiar with the Swiss situation than I am. I gather that it&amp;#39;s complicated — as &lt;a href="http://www.forumfed.org/en/products/magazine/vol7_num1/switzerland.php"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; explains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;According to Swiss jurisprudence and legal doctrine, the principle of 'linguistic freedom' means the right to use any official language in communications by private parties with the state and between themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The protection of this constitutional right is, however, qualified by the territorial principle, which permits linguistic freedom to be limited to preserve the traditional makeup, boundaries and homogeneity of linguistic territories. By ensuring that linguistic communities have the space they require, the territorial principle recognizes that an individual can only realize himself or herself as a member of a linguistic community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is some history of traditional language-related conflict in Switzerland, according to William R. Keech, "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/421559"&gt;Linguistic Diversity and Political Conflict: Some Observations Based on Four Swiss Cantons&lt;/a&gt;", Comparative Politics 4(3) 1972:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;While Switzerland is correctly known as a country in which different ethnic groups live together peacefully, there are a few Swiss setting in which there is conflict among these groups, Of the twenty-five cantons and half-cantons, four have historical linguistic minorities. Of these four, three have been rather free of sharp conflict among language groups, while one has known almost constant tension for many years. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;In Bern, … there is intense conflict among language groups. […] Over the last twenty years, French-speaking spearatists have committed arson, blown up railroad tracks and military barracks, defaced statues, broken up meetings, and the like, using terrorist tactics to punish opponents and to call attention to their plight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conflict resulted in the creation of a new canton, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Jura"&gt;Jura&lt;/a&gt;, in 1979 — presumably using &amp;quot;the territorial principle&amp;quot; to conciliate the dispute. But apparently things are &lt;a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/Citizens_to_settle_territorial_Jura_conflict.html?cid=7377228"&gt;not quite settled yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this residue of traditional ethno-linguistic divisions, Switzerland is presumably facing new linguistic issues due to the fact that it has one of the &lt;a href="http://www.migrationinformation.org/USfocus/display.cfm?ID=284"&gt;highest immigration rates in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly a quarter of the population now foreign-born.  I haven&amp;#39;t seen much discussion of linguistic issues — maybe the immigrating Eastern Europeans, North Africans, etc. are mainly learning German or French, or perhaps knew one of these languages before they arrived.  But I can&amp;#39;t imagine that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_People%27s_Party"&gt;SVP&lt;/a&gt; would be very tolerant of any immigrants who insist on quasi-official status for native languages that are not already part of the established Swiss linguistic structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this should be taken as support for the various "English Only" or "Official English" movements in the U.S.  As far as I can tell, these are potentially damaging attempts to solve a perceived problem that is continuing to solve itself, just as it has throughout American history.&lt;/p&gt;

Richard Gregory, CBE, FRS, passed away on May 17th at age 86.  He was Professor of Neuropsychology in the Brain and Perception laboratory at  Bristol University, where he remained active to the end after his formal  retirement.  As well as his very well-known research on visual perception, he was  the author of an important 1966 article in the journal &lt;em&gt;Eye and Brain&lt;/em&gt; which went through multiple editions in many languages and must have been read  by most psychology students and many others over the last 40+ years. He was  also editor of the &lt;em&gt;Oxford Companion to the Mind&lt;/em&gt;, and founder of the  journal &lt;em&gt;Perception&lt;/em&gt;. He was an advocate for scientific psychology and was enthusiastically  committed to the public understanding of science, in particular to the development  of the &lt;em&gt;Exploratory&lt;/em&gt;, a hands-on science centre in Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Gregory and I spent a few enjoyable and informative hours together a few  years ago in the UK discussing the art of conjuring and how it relates to  persistence of vision, angles of view, and other related aspects of sensory  perception.  It was a very valuable and enjoyable encounter with an interesting and – dare I say it – perceptive observer.&lt;/p&gt;

To non-tube-dwellers like us they may even look vaguely reminiscent of the much more famous giant tube worms, and the concept is quite similar up until that point.However, if you look inside a tube with its live host, something distinctly non-annelid peers out:This creature is, in fact, a ciliate - a relative of the elegant Folliculina (referred to in the good ol' days as the "bottle-animalcule"), Folliculinopsis sp., a heterotrich like the giant Stentor:Folliculinopsis. The two long 'wings' or 'ears' sticking out are its peristomal lobes, which can be seen in the preceding SEM. (Ji et al. 2004 J Ocean Univ China)Folliculinopsis is host to countless bacterial symbionts; in fact so lushly the bacteria thrive on it that one can barely see the ciliate beneath them! Presumably, these bacteria may be involved in chemical defense, protection from the rather toxic surrounding environment or assist in metabolism. Symbiosis with prokaryotes seems to be fairly common for eukaryotes living awkward (extreme) environments, in large part because prokaryotes are simply amazing at biochemistry unlike their metabolically-challenged nucleated counterparts.SEMs and TEM of symbiotic bacteria on Folliculinopsis sp. The lorica is covered mostly with filamentous bacteria (top left) whereas the surface of the ciliate is entirely covered with coccoid and rod-shaped episymbionts (bottom two SEMs). Moreover, the inside of the ciliate is full of bacteria-containing vacuoles, as seen in the TEM (near the cortex). (Kouris et al. 2007 Mar Ecol) In another folliculinid, Eufolliculina, the surface of the peristomal lobes has a peculiar feature: short membrane-covered pins at the base of each cilium. Mulisch (1991 Cell Tissue Res) proposes these pins may act as sensory organelles, perhaps to transmit oriented mechanical stimuli. The cilia have a swelling at the level of the pin, filled with peculiar granular particles with potential involvement in calcium regulation (as you may recall from intro-level physiology, Ca2+ is quite popular in signaling systems). Similar cilium-pin complexes have also been found in other folliculinids, suggesting it may be a shared feature.Cilia with sensory pegs at the base (arrows). (Mulisch 1991 Cell Tissue Res)The cilium-peg complex reminds me of sensory hairs or sensilla on insects. Mulisch relates it to the hydrozoan cnidocil in the cnidocyst, or the stereocilia (microvili) at the base of the kinocilium in vertebrate sensory hair bundles. Perhaps this is yet another instance of ultimate convergence, as there is ultimately a finite number of ways particular functions can be performed, and evolution's random walks are bound to chance upon some more than once.The biology of protist sensory mechansims and overall behaviour is still vast, mysterious, murky territory desperately in need of serious investigation. Unicellular organisms have complex behaviours just like multicellular ones, and are no more 'mere automatic responders to stimuli' than we are (due to our cumbersome complexity, much more random noise tends to creep in; perhaps where creativity comes from...); somehow, without a brain or even a nervous system, many unicellular organisms are nevertheless quite capable of performing complex behaviours in response to various stimuli.This topic was quite popular in the early 20th century, but seems to have been largely abandoned today (in unicellular organisms). Considering the volumes of papers published daily on cell motility in tissue cultures, would it be too much to ask for some investigation of more intelligent cell types, ie. those that also act as entire organisms? Surely a ciliate must be much m...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

They are angry and frustrated, and they want to strike back against secularists equally well, in ways that will also infuriate us. To their credit, though, some realize that threatening to decapitate heretics isn&amp;#39;t exactly smart and civilized…they need &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; that will illustrate to us how hurtful violating their religious precepts was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to do, what to do…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Muslim genius has come up with the answer: &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Everybody-draw-Holocaust-day-30-June-2010/125126400846347"&gt;EVERYBODY RESEARCH HOLOCAUST DAY&lt;/a&gt;. On 30 June, he is encouraging everyone to engage in "critical study" of "the foundational myth of the secular cult".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the injustice that takes place in our world stems from ignorance. We reject being emotionally blackmailed by Hollywood tales and holocaust museums which legitimize the war crimes and crimes against humanity of the extremist Atheist regime of Tel-Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this guy proposes to reply to drawing stick-figure Mohammeds with &lt;i&gt;holocaust denial&lt;/i&gt; and the negation of history? Yeah, that'll improve the reputation of Islam as the domain of rational thought. He also has his own justification, that tries to claim the moral high ground in this disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is that you draw Lies about Muhammad and we draw Truth about you. That you seek to bring unrest and conflict, and we wish to uncover the reality so injustice is no more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does make one good point, though. He asks if he&amp;#39;s free to question the holocaust, just as we are free to question Islam. I&amp;#39;d say yes, he should be, but I know that some European countries have put special restrictions on this one area of inquiry — you are not allowed to express a certain wrong opinion about the holocaust without risk of penalty, and that&amp;#39;s not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people should be free to say awesomely stupid things so we can &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/michaelpeck/2010/05/24/now-its-everybody-deny-the-holocaust-day/"&gt;point and laugh and watch their whole effort collapse in stupidity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/thatll_teach_us.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/NMYX3QCUKp0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274790638751"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=3870">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2db5a1fedd2775bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="consumer information"/><category term="legislation"/><category term="quackery"/><category term="Australian Doctor"/><category term="Code of Conduct"/><category term="frauds"/><category term="HCCC"/><category term="Hemaview"/><category term="Mind body Spirit festival"/><category term="Mind Body Wallet"/><category term="NSW DEpt Health"/><category term="scams"/><category term="TGA"/><category term="Therapeutic Goods Administration"/><title type="html">Dodgy devices to be regulated?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dodgy devices to be regulated  	25-May-2010  	By Michael East&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE manufacturers of shonky devices used by alternative therapists to carry out what they claim are diagnostic tests will soon have to provide clinical evidence that they work under new Therapeutic Goods Administration regulations.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes, which will be introduced in July, are in response to growing concerns about the number of in-vitro diagnostic devices employed by alternative therapists.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the products advertised on the internet is the “Hemaview”, which, according to its manufacturer, uses one or two drops of blood projected onto a video screen to diagnose “nutritional deficiencies, organ dysfunction and certain biochemical imbalances”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director of the Alfred Hospital’s department of haematology Professor Hatem Salem said users of the device were “pulling the wool over people’s eyes”.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The notion that one can diagnose all sorts of ailments by examining a drop of blood on a video screen is both ridiculous and plain stupid.”&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the TGA is only able to regulate diagnostic devices included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, including those that test for HIV and hepatitis C, as well as those used in the home.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many of the in-vitro diagnostic devices used by alternative therapists have been exempt from scrutiny because they are not considered medical devices.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From July the makers of all in-vitro diagnostic devices will then be required to show clinical evidence that their products work but will have four years to fulfil the new requirements. They will also have to make clear to the public the potential risks of the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
I’m afraid I’m sceptical. Required to show clinical evidence? To whom? Unfortunately the TGA does not have a very good track record of policing things like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the homeopath who made all sorts of outrageous claims about magic water as a substitute for vaccination? Fran Sheffield of Homeopathy Plus! simply didn’t agree with TGA findings that her claims were misleading, so chose to ignore a ruling to remove such material from her website. And in an example of laughing in the face of the law, the day after she was exposed on &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2867990.htm"&gt;ABC1’s Lateline programme by Steve Cannane&lt;/a&gt;, she jumped the shark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post entitled; &lt;strong&gt;“Lateline: Can homeopathy safely protect against epidemic and infectious diseases? Can homeopathy treat serious diseases such AIDS and cancer?”&lt;/strong&gt; she went even further, claiming that water could safely treat AIDS and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whilst I applaud this legislation in principle, how does the TGA, or other relevant health authorities plan to police it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regularly attend the Mind Body Spirit/Wallet Festival in Sydney where there is a plethora of snake oil salesman using Hemaview and collecting money hand over fist from gullible clients. It’s a perfect set-up; let us diagnose you with some allergy or somesuch and then when I reach over here, I have a bucket of powder for the special price of way-too-much which will fix you right up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NSW in 2008, &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/04/20/regulating-the-unregistered/"&gt;legislation was introduced to regulate unregistered health practitioners&lt;/a&gt;, that is, those who are not already represented by a regulatory body like doctors or dietitians. Section 17 of the &lt;a href="http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/Information/Information-for-Unregistered-Practitioners/Default/default.aspx"&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; states that a health practitioner must display the code and a document that gives information about where clients can complain to the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have dutifully trotted off to the MB$ four times now, will my code clutched tightly under my arm and as yet, I have not once seen the code displayed. It’s now become a bit of a joke between my friends and as such, we have nick-named our futile search “Code of Conduct Bingo”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “festival” had enough quackery and snake oil to start a factory. (As an aside, one also has to wonder how much of the takings are declared to the tax department at the end of the four day love in). Make no mistake, a large amount of cash is collected, when you count up the magic scalar energy infused Fusion Excel Pendants for $150-$200 (available from Alibaba.com &lt;a href="http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/308952704/Fusion_Excel_Quantum_Scalar_Energy_Pendant.html"&gt;for 6 bucks a pop&lt;/a&gt;) or the $45 for a 20 minute reading with a psychic (queues last week extended half way across the exhibition hall). Or the dangerous and useless ear candles, which you can buy wholesale for 20 cents a pop, or pay about 15 bucks for three at the MB$ (after you pay your 16 bucks to get in). Or how about a $60 Power Balance Bracelet (available from Alibaba.com for &lt;a href="http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/310661523/power_balance.html"&gt;between 50 and 80 cents&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two years I have been attending, I have not been aware of any representatives from relevant health bodies lurking around – this doesn’t mean they are not there of course. It would hardly make sense to walk around declaring your identity if you wanted to catch people in the act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But certainly, I’ve been mistaken for such as person, at a Hemaview stand in fact. A colleague and I were asking for published evidence for the statement “clinically tested” which was splashed all over their stand, when the pamphlet he was holding was rapidly snatched out of his hand and the previously helpful assistant demanded, &lt;strong&gt;“are you Doctors?? Why do you want to know?…ARE YOU FROM THE TGA?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thou doth protesteth too much methinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes very difficult not to lose your temper with these people, particularly when you know they are blowing it out their arse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I was exposed to a Hemaview/Live Blood Analysis person at the MB$, I was carefully shuffled away by my friend as my voice began to break and my ears to steam. It took him a good 10 mins to calm me down from the tidal wave of bullshit that had passed over me. You see, as a scientist I knew the terminology spewing from the representatives gob was real, but the deceit of peppering sciencey sounding words into a spiel about woo, to make it sound legitimate was too much for my science educated brain. She was right when she observed, just before I was escorted to the nearest corner, that I had been “affected by what she said”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just it was not in the way she presumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another time at another Hemaview stand, I was with a nurse colleague when we were surreptitiously moved on with a nod the boss man. I guess he had twigged we were onto their profitable little scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting nonetheless, to observe the way woo-purveyors react to being challenged on their claims. After a fair bit of experience, I’ve come up with a theory. The ones who get angry and ask you to leave, are probably knowingly deceiving the punters. You might call them frauds or con men. The ones who genuinely try to answer your questions, even if their explanations are completely implausible and off with the fairies, are probably genuine, even if they are deluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit like the psychics who spot you in the crowd, knowing who you are, and point out there are a lot of fake psychics here today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’M DEFINITELY NOT A FAKE, but look over there – he is!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, personally, I am not confident this new legislation with have much of an impact of the alternative medicine industry. And it also seems odd that they are given four years to comply. Why so long? One thing is for certain though, the addition of legislation designed to clean up the industry will lend it unwarranted legitimacy. Imagine how happy snake oil purveyors will be to declare that their quantum energy box has been approved by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TGA is failing the Australian public. It’s a disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, over at &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/jerry-coynes-insufferable-argument/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Giberson chastises me for my theological unsophistication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caricaturing the [theodicy] argument Coyne writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evolution by natural causes in effect emancipates  religion from the shackles of       theodicy. No longer need we agonize about why a Creator God is the  world’s leading       abortionist and mass murderer… No longer need we be tempted to  blaspheme an       omnipotent Deity by charging Him directly responsible for human  frailties and       physical shortcomings … No longer need we blame a Creator God’s  direct hand for       any of these disturbing empirical facts. Instead, we can put the  blame squarely on the       agency of insentient natural evolutionary causation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coyne concludes: “If evolution is to become a “welcome partner” to  religion, the faithful will have to accept that evolution and natural  selection were God’s plan for creating life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a slight problem here.  The quote in italics, attributed to me, is not mine.  It is in fact a quote by John Avise in the &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; article that Giberson is &lt;em&gt;praising&lt;/em&gt;, “Footprints of nonsentient design inside the human genome”&lt;br&gt;
(you’ll find it on &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/05/04/0914609107.short"&gt;p. 7 of Avise’s piece&lt;/a&gt;). So hurt is Giberson by the atheists’ refusal to play, and so eager is he to rush his criticisms of the New Atheists into print, that he doesn’t even notice that what he claims is my “caricature” of  theodicy is actually the argument that Avise is making and that Giberson himself is defending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Giberson reads this website, so I expect him to fix this forthwith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while we’re fixing the record, let’s look at one statement Giberson makes while playing nice with Dan Dennett in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-05-24-column24_ST_N.htm"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tufts  University philosopher and leading atheist Daniel Dennet no doubt  finds all this mystifying, since he thinks seminary education should  ultimately terminate one’s faith: “Anybody who goes through seminary and  comes out believing in God hasn’t been paying attention,” he told&lt;em&gt; The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s forget that he misspells “Dennett” (and it’s not a typo, because he does it in the next sentence, too).  Here’s what “Dennet” told the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DENNETT: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s true, here are these young people in seminary, they have  come with the purest of hearts and the noblest of intentions and they’re  going to devote their lives to God. And one of the first things they  learn is textual criticism. They’re looking at all the existing  papyruses and scrolls and so forth and learning about the recension of  the texts — the tortuous and often controversial historical path from  Hebrew, Greek, and Latin versions of the books of the Bible — and all  the Apocryphal books that got rejected — to the King James Version and  all the later English translations. And that’s not what they taught you  in Sunday school.&lt;em&gt; That’s the joke that we often provoke from  people when we talk about  this: Anybody who goes through seminary and  comes out believing in God  hasn’t been paying attention. &lt;/em&gt;[My italics.]&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Dennett said it, but it’s clear that he’s describing &lt;em&gt;other peoples’ reactions&lt;/em&gt;.  This quote in fact comes from p. 23 of the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/dennett-and-lascola-study-on-nonbelieving-clergy/"&gt;study by Dennett and Linda LaScola&lt;/a&gt;, “Preachers who are not believers,”  (download it &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith//2010/03/disbelief_in_the_pulpit/all.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), examining the curious case of active clergy who don’t accept God:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gulf opened up between what one says from the pulpit and what one has been taught in seminary. This gulf is well-known in religious circles. . .  Every Christian minister, not just those in our little study, has to confront this awkwardness, and no doubt there are many more ways of responding to it than our small sample illustrates. How widespread is this phenomenon? When we asked one of the other pastors we talked with initially if he thought clergy with his views were rare in the church, he responded “Oh, you can’t go through seminary and come out believing in God!” Surely an overstatement, but a telling one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement was made not by Dennett but by a &lt;em&gt;pastor&lt;/em&gt;, and although that’s not completely clear in the &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt; piece, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; clear is that the words don’t represent Dennett’s own thoughts—in fact, he and LaScola characterize them as an “overstatement” in the original article.  I guess Giberson didn’t read that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, there’s this little bit of nastiness from Giberson’s &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Harris described Collins’ personal religious journey, unfolded in his  best-seller &lt;em&gt;The Language of God,&lt;/em&gt; as an account of “nothing less  than an intellectual suicide.” Harris, who finally completed his Ph.D.  in neuroscience at UCLA, apparently believes that neurons used for  religious belief simply won’t work if applied to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt; completed his Ph.D? What’s that all about?  It can be nothing other than a slap at Harris for taking &lt;em&gt;too long&lt;/em&gt; to get his doctorate. Absent the intent to slur, the word “finally” is superfluous.  But jeez, Dr. Giberson, given that Harris is producing big books, running a website, writing a lot of popular articles, dealing with a new mouth to feed, and doing graduate work, all at the same time, it’s amazing that he could get a Ph.D. &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Giberson is playing Joe McCarthy, accusing New Atheists of being “un-American” in their criticism of faith, let me play Joseph Welch: “Have you no sense of decency, Dr. Giberson? At long last, have you left no sense of decency—or scholarship?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students voted yes, so Constitution be damned, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/02/high-school-students-vote-on-saying-a-graduation-prayer-judge-says-no/"&gt;wise judge&lt;/a&gt; said no — she issued an injunction against the school so they couldn’t say a prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  No prayer during graduation, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school has found a loophole…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A central Indiana high school that was the subject of a lawsuit over a graduation prayer says &lt;strong&gt;it is breaking with tradition and will not screen speeches by speakers&lt;/strong&gt; at its May 28 commencement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Greenwood High School’s principal has required student speakers to submit their speeches in advance to review the content, grammar and length. Most schools in the nation follow similar practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Greenwood is lifting the practice this year, and school officials say speakers will not be stopped even if they use profane language or deliver politically charged speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School officials would not comment on the reason for the change.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s read between the lines: If students &lt;em&gt;just so happen&lt;/em&gt; to include a prayer in their speech, it’s not like those speeches will be screened beforehand… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt; sums up &lt;a href="http://www.skepticmoney.com/greenwood-indiana-high-school-circumvents-the-law-again/"&gt;the potential consequences&lt;/a&gt; nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We will not review speeches “wink, wink”.  You can say what ever you want, “Wink, Wink”.  You could even lead a prayer, “WINK, WINK”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some reason to have hope, though.  The student who initially brought up the &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/28255503/Workman-v-Grenwood-Complt"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; school prayer was the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/15/indiana-high-school-puts-graduation-prayer-up-for-a-vote-valedictorian-sues/"&gt;school’s valedictorian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Workman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would think he’d be giving a speech that is prayer-less.  So yay for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if a student &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make references to god or prayer, that wouldn’t be a legal issue.  Students are allowed to do that.  It’s &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt; officials who cannot endorse prayer or include an official prayer in the graduation ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a weak attempt at circumventing the law and they’ve already lost the case.  They’re just trying to dig that hole even deeper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of their successful slogans has been “too many, too soon” – implying that children are receiving too many vaccines while they are still too young to deal with them. The result, anti-vaccinationists argue, is potential neurological toxicity or “overwhelming” the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slogan also serves double duty, allowing anti-vaccinationists to argue that they are not “anti-vaccine” just “pro-safe vaccine.” This is just more marketing savvy, however – a deliberate deception, as many of the people who make this claim also state that they would never vaccinate. (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_refusers_proving_oracs_corollary_to.php"&gt;Orac has pointed this out&lt;/a&gt; many times in great insolent detail.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some parents who have bought into this notion and have reduced and/or delayed the number of vaccines their children receive in the hopes that they can strike a better balance of risk vs benefit than the experts have struck. And there are fringe doctors, like &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, who promotes his own evidence-free alternate vaccine schedule, playing into the “too many, too soon” meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can argue along theoretical grounds that the vaccine schedule is safe, without making much of a psychological impact.  Paul Offit has pointed out that the environment presents a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;far greater daily challenge to young immune systems&lt;/a&gt; than a few vaccines do. Further the modern vaccine schedule &lt;a href="http://sciencenotes.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/vaccines-and-immune-system-overload/"&gt;contains fewer antigens &lt;/a&gt;(immune provoking substances) than at any time in the last 100 years (because of the elimination of the smallpox vaccine and improvements made to the pertussis vaccine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also point out the safety data for the recommended vaccine schedule and the utter lack of any evidence to support the claim that Dr. Gordon’s or any other alternate schedule is safer. But fear and anecdote are easier spread than reassurance through dry data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always nice, therefore, to have evidence directly comparing the standard schedule vs a delayed and reduced schedule – and now we have that data. A &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/peds.2009-2489v1"&gt;study published just yesterday online in Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; compares neurological outcomes at age 7 and 10 in 1047 children based upon their vaccine schedule. They used publicly available data from a prior study – the VaccineSafety Datalink study of thimerosal exposure which tracked 42 neuropsychological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receipt of all recommended childhood vaccines on time in the first year of life in 1993–1997 had no negative impact on neuropsychological outcomes at 7 to 10 years of age, compared with delayed receipt or nonreceipt of &amp;gt;=1 dose during infancy. In fact, children who received each dose of each vaccine on time performed better on 2 of the 42 outcomes tested after adjustment for multiple familial and socioeconomic factors. Those with delayed receipt or nonreceipt of &amp;gt;=1 infant dose did not perform better on any measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were actually 12 outcomes out of 42 that were superior for the on-time group than the delayed group, but only 2 of these held up after multivariable analysis. What this means is that if you take each outcome by itself there was statistical significance for 12, but because you are looking at 42 different variables that is 42 chances to reach statistical significance, and so we would expect a few to be positive by randomness alone. You can compensate for this with multivariable analysis, and after adjusting for multiple comparisons 2 outcomes remained significant in favor of the on-time group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could represent just noise in the data, or it could reflect the fact that parents who comply with the vaccine schedule may provide a more nurturing or healthy environment for their children in other ways. It could also reflect a decreased disease burden in vaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case – the data strongly argues against any benefit from delaying or reducing vaccine. Meanwhile, delaying or skipping vaccines does come with an increased risk of contracting potential serious childhood diseases, like pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual caveats apply – this study is observational and not experimental. The vaccine schedule was chosen by the parents and not randomized or blinded. A randomized trial at this point, however, has serious ethical concerns and for that reason will likely never be done. Parents who believe in vaccines would probably not allow their children to potentially be randomized to a reduced or absent vaccine schedule, and parents fearful of vaccines may not want their children randomized to a full vaccine schedule. So don’t hold your breath for such a study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, this is still a solid study and while not definitive is further evidence and reassurance for the safety of the vaccine schedule and the lack of any safety advantage (in fact a potential disadvantage) to alternate vaccine schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics are likely to point out that the cohort of patients studied in this trial were born between 1993 and 1997 and the vaccine schedule has increased since then. However, in order to get long term follow up (like the 10 year follow up in this study) you have to look at the vaccine schedule from at least 10 years ago. Also, the schedule today actually has fewer antigens and almost no thimerosal. Further if there were any safety advantage to delaying or reducing the vaccine schedule this study should still have been able to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how Dr. Gordon and other advocates of an alternate vaccine schedule respond to this new evidence. A science-based practitioner should alter what they do as new evidence comes in. But Gordon and the anti-vaccinationists have demonstrated adequately that they are not evidence-based, and prefer to rely more on their instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note – the British doctor, Andrew Wakefield, whose discredited MMR study was largely responsible for spreading fears about vaccines and autism, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7134893.ece"&gt;was recently “struck off”&lt;/a&gt; the list of medical doctors in the UK. This essentially means he has lost his license to practice. Although now he is already on to his next career here in the US as a martyr for the anti-vaccine movement, and this latest dishonor will only enhance that career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_____________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/eletters/peds.2009-2489v1"&gt;A letter has been published&lt;/a&gt; on the Pediatrics website concerning this study. The author, Lawrence Rosen, points out that the numbers in the results section do not add up. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all of the subjects are added as listed, a total of 1037 (not 1047) is obtained. Furthermore, the percentages are incorrect as listed. The final group (311) is in fact 30% of the incorrect total, not 20% as listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is correct, but I think he is using what is essentially a copy edit error to try to discredit publicly available data. The numbers in the tables do add up to 1047 – so one of the numbers copied to the results section was written wrong. The “20%” error is also just a copy mistake and does not affect the data at all. It should be corrected to “30%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosen also points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of greater concern to me, personally, is the Financial Disclosure listings. It is very difficult in this day and age to review the authors’ conclusions without considering their considerable potential biases given where their funding comes from. I believe every known vaccine manufacturer is listed on the payroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the “Conflict of Interest” gambit now common in the anti-vaccine crowd.  Here is the full COI from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drs Smith and Woods are or have been unfunded subinvestigators for cross-coverage purposes on vaccine clinical trials for which their colleagues receive funding from Wyeth, Sanofi Pasteur, GSK, MedImmune, and Novartis; and Dr Woods has received honoraria for speaking engagements from Merck, Sanofi Pasteur, Pfizer, and MedImmune and has received research funding from Wyeth and Sanofi Pasteur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is hardly a conflict – they worked with other researchers without getting paid. Dr. Smith has no other conflicts. Dr. Woods has received some speaking fees and has received research funding from two companies, Wyeth and Sanofi Pasteur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words – they are academic researchers. This does not mean that they are “on the payroll” of pharmaceutical companies, and the COI disclosure says nothing about this study being funded by any company. This is the kind of study that academics can do without external funding, just as part of their academic activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Rosen is using connections that are ultimately trivial and not relevant to this study as a way to cast doubt on the findings. This is surely to be the strategy of the anti-vaccine movement as a whole, as they have done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we need to be vigilant about real conflicts of interest in medical research. But what Dr. Rosen is doing is a COI witch hunt designed to dismiss inconvenient data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274785904761"><id gr:original-id="http://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/what-might-have-been/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e21413ad9926f93f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">What might have been</title><published>2010-05-25T06:00:08Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T06:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/LvzgC9VolOU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/what-might-have-been/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Can dreaming up alternatives to what actually happened ever be anything more than a waste of time and effort?...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kenya's Islamic courts are illegal and discriminatory, a panel of judges has ruled.

&lt;p&gt;The three judges said the Islamic "Kadhi" courts favoured Islam over other faiths, and that this was unconstitutional as Kenya was a secular country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;It could be the cutbacks to the city’s transportation system, or a general decline in urban civility. Perhaps people are just in a collective bad mood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;What else could explain why New Yorkers — notoriously hardened to the slings and arrows of everyday life here — are spitting on bus drivers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Of all the assaults that prompted a bus operator to take paid leave in 2009, a third of them, 51 in total, “involved a spat upon,” according to statistics the Metropolitan Transportation Authority released on Monday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That apparent use of "spat upon" as a noun wasn't a mistake, as confirmed by another example later in the same article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Almost no arrests have been reported for spitting on a driver, said Mr. Smith, who noted that a police officer “must witness the spat upon to give a summons.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy for "spat upon" to be &lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/movies/19sir.html"&gt;used as a modifier&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The image of &lt;strong&gt;the spat-upon Vietnam veteran&lt;/strong&gt;, explains Jerry Lembcke, himself a Vietnam veteran and one of the persuasive talking heads who appears in the new film, helped maintain the important fiction that opposition to the war came strictly from outside the military.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like any modifier, "spat upon" is happy to stand by itself as a noun, for instance here in James Baldwin's &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UY6jJNIz8vQC"&gt;Go Tell it on the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;They were the despised and rejected, the wretched and &lt;strong&gt;the spat upon&lt;/strong&gt;, the earth's offscouring; and he was in their company, and they would swallow up his soul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this normal nounification involves an implicit "ones", so that "the X-ed" means "the X-ed ones", not "the process of someone being X-ed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the MTA's usage, "involved a spat upon" seems to mean "involved an incident of (a driver) being spat upon"; and "must witness the spat upon" seems to mean "must witness the incident of (a driver) being spat upon".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of manner, process or result nouns from bare verbs is fairly common — &lt;em&gt;bruise&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;crash&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;push&lt;/em&gt; — and sometimes people have trouble with new coinages of this type (e.g. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001331.html"&gt;It's a big ask&lt;/a&gt;", 8/7/2004).  But I can't think of any other examples of a past participle being used as a process nominal. It's as if we talked about "a crashed" or "a pushed" instead of "a crash" or "a push".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the preposition &lt;em&gt;upon&lt;/em&gt; doesn't really change this. There are plenty of result or process nominals consisting of a bare verb and a preposition: one that's been in the news recently is &lt;em&gt;blow-out &lt;/em&gt;"A rapid, uncontrolled uprush of fluid from an oil well". But it's "a blow out", not "a blown out".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the Transit Authority's "spat upon" is an instance of a much less constrained process, whereby nearly-arbitrary strings of words come to be used as modifiers or as nominal heads: "the nothing-left-to-chance approach",  "make-it-from-scratch traditionalists",  "a case of why not". We've coined a few of these here at Language Log Plaza: "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001963.html"&gt;WTF grammar&lt;/a&gt;" is an example that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of "spat upon", the history is presumably something like this. Dozens of times a year, the bureaucracy needs to document incidents where a driver is spat upon.  In a prominent place on the leave-request form, there's a line for Nature of Incident, where the formula in such cases is "Driver was spat upon".  These are then naturally called "'Driver was spat upon' incidents".  But after processing a few dozen of them, people start staying things like "Here, I've got another 'spat upon' incident for you".  And after a few dozen more, it's just "Gee, that's the seventh 'spat upon' this month".&lt;/p&gt;

The findings come after the General Medical Council ruled yesterday that Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who first suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, was guilty of serious professional misconduct.The MMR vaccine protects children against measles, mumps and rubella. Unfortunately the number of UK parents vaccinating their children plummeted in the wake of Wakefield&amp;#39;s 1998 Lancet study, since discredited and un-replicated, which purported to show a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Today vaccination rates remain at around 85 per cent, compared with the desired rate of 90 to 95 per cent rate required for herd immunity (whereby even the unvaccinated are safe).For the new study, Benjamin Gardner and colleagues analysed five focus group interviews they held with 28 parents in London. The parents were asked for their responses to three &amp;#39;motivation-based&amp;#39; interventions (a website; an information pack; and parent-led group discussions) and three &amp;#39;organisational interventions&amp;#39; (health care workers acting as immunisation champions; mobile vaccination units; legislation to penalise non-compliers). Five key themes emerged. Parents felt they didn&amp;#39;t have enough information, especially in relation to the dangers associated with not vaccinating. Government sources were not trusted. By contrast, other parents were trusted: &amp;#39;Parents trust advice from other parents,&amp;#39; one mother said. &amp;#39;[You] take it on board. You listen to them.&amp;#39; Parents also revealed they were biased towards risk-related information. And they misunderstood balance, believing that pro- and anti-MMR arguments should be given equal weight even though the scientific evidence overwhelming favours MMR vaccination. Gardner&amp;#39;s team said a number of practical implications emerged from their findings. In particular, promotional MMR campaigns are likely to be better received if they appear to be independent of government and if they are fronted by parents. More information is needed about the risks of non-vaccination. And care should be taken when highlighting the small risks associated with vaccination - parents are likely to zoom in on these.The researchers acknowledged their study has some limitations, most notably that the majority of the parents involved had actually vaccinated their children. Nonetheless, they said their results &amp;#39;highlight important psychological barriers and facilitators that may determine whether MMR promotion interventions are effective.&amp;#39; _________________________________Gardner B, Davies A, McAteer J, &amp;amp; Michie S (2010).

Yes, it's true. Every so often I get really, really tired of the bad science, pseudoscience, magical thinking, misinformation, and even outright lies that emanate from various anti-vaccine websites and blogs. This week, I promised myself I would try not to do it. There are times when duty calls, and this is one of those times. For better or for worse, as hard as I still find it to believe, somehow I've become one of the top bloggers defending vaccines, and there are times when I have to stop whining and just embrace this role. Given the one-two-three triple whammy of the start of the anti-vaccine autism quackfest Autism One, Andrew Wakefield having had his license to practice medicine in the U.K. yanked, and the hilariously insane anti-vaccine rally to take place in Grant Park in Chicago tomorrow, it's time just to go with the flow and do what needs to be done.

Today this is something I'm more than happy to do, at least today.

If there's one thing about the anti-vaccine movement that I've learned over the last several years, it's that it's nothing if not, for lack of a better word, nearly infinitely pliable. To put it more simply, anti-vaccine activists are experts at throwing out as much stuff as they can and seeing if anything sticks, adjusting their stories, and moving the goalposts every time each of their successive demands for more evidence are met by scientists. Although there has always been an anti-vaccine movement, its most recent incarnation is built primarily around the idea that vaccines cause autism somehow. First it was Andrew Wakefield presenting dubious, trial lawyer-funded "research" purporting to show that the MMR vaccine causes "autistic enterocolitis" and even autism itself. Then, not long after that, the U.S. version of this manufactrovery showed up in the form of the concept that mercury in the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccines cause autism, promoted initially by David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Fortunately, more than a decade's worth of research consisting of large epidemiological studies has utterly failed to find even a whiff of a hint of a link between either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccine movement simply moved the goalposts to the "toxins" gambit, in which it is claimed that vaccines are laced with "toxins" such as formaldehyde, antifreeze, and tissue from aborted fetuses. Never mind that there are no parts from aborted fetuses or antifreeze in vaccines, and scary-sounding chemicals like formaldehyde are present in concentrations far too low to be a problem. Even so, "Green our Vaccines" sure sounds like a slogan that means something, even though it doesn't.

The latest gambit, and arguably one of the most successful because it's the most vague and difficult to falsify, is the "Too Many Too Soon" slogan. Under this idea, anti-vaccine propagandists claim that infants are getting too many vaccines too soon (hence the slogan) and that all those nasty vaccines being given to such young infants is somehow messing up their immune system, attacking their brains, and giving them autism. This is a tough one to combat because the only definitive way to refute it would involve studying unvaccinated versus vaccinated children (which, not surprisingly, is the latest demand of the anti-vaccine movement). Doing such a study in a rigorous prospective randomized fashion would be completely unethical because it would leave the control group unprotected, while retrospective studies would be prone to a lot of confounders, given that there are likely to be other factors besides vaccination status that make populations who aren't vaccinated different from those who are.

That's why a study hot off the presses yesterday (well, hot off the web, as it were, given that it's an E-pub ahead of print) is so well timed. Released right as Autism One starts and Andrew Wakefield tanks, what better time for a study to look right at the very question that anti-vaccinationists seem to want answered? The title of the article is even an arrow aimed right at the heart of the "too many too soon" mantra, namely On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not

The publisher is marketing it as a novel gift for atheists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books on/for atheists? Cool beans! Send it along! While it was heading here, I looked for other reviews to see what it could be about. It looks like the publisher is sending it to atheist blogs and although numerous people have mentioned getting the invitation to review it, I could only find two reviews on it, which I'll address after the book itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I finally received the book about a month and a half ago. I read the first few chapters and put it down when I was sent another book to review that ended up being far more interesting. But the publisher dropped me an Email asking me if I'd had time to read it yet. I'd intended to write a short, personal response, but in picking the book back up to pass long the few notes I'd made so far, I decided to go ahead an finish it since it's a very quick read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This review may seem somewhat odd. But then again, the book is amazingly odd. I'm not going to start out with describing the premise of the book, because when I started out reading it, I had no idea what it was about. So this will be more of a liveblogging of my (re)reading as opposed to my more usual retrospective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the opening pages the author claims to use logic, but then shortly thereafter demands that anyone disagreeing must be thinking incorrectly and should read it again, and again, and again,... until they agree. This is not logic. This is brainwashing. If it's wrong the first time, it will continue to be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within the first few pages of the first chapter, the author claims there are two "lists" which essentially boil down to the "haves" and "have-nots", just rephrased. This is the logical fallacy of bifurcation. Again, logic is abandoned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first page of the second chapter contains even more errors, in claiming that time existed 50 gigayears ago. The Big Bang happened only 13.6 gigayears ago and physics has revealed that time and space were wrapped up in such a way that talking about them existing prior to that instant is complete nonsense. Thus, claiming that time existed prior to that is simply wrong, yet the author claims it must exist because the author cannot perceive any other option. Yet another logical fallacy (argument from personal incredulity/ignorance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In chapter 4, this same problem is repeated, but instead of time, the author extends personal incredulity to matter and energy. While this is mostly true due to the conservation of mass/energy, it's not strictly true when you get to the quantum level. Later, the author seems to imply that energy is created from matter when you burn wood. This is completely incorrect. It comes from the destruction of bonds in the matter. This is straight out of high school chemistry. The bastardization of the term theory at the end of the chapter is likewise unimpressive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 5 questions why orbits are elliptical and goes through, yet again, an argument from ignorance. Although the author is right (orbits are elliptical), it's for the entirely wrong reasons. The author then describes perpetual motion using the analogy of a rocket to Venus. While the picture is more or less accurate (less in that he claims no energy occurs once the engines stop firing and it will coast. Energy is still being used in that the Sun's gravitational energy will still cause an acceleration. This doesn't destroy the point, but is a rather blatant oversight.), it is somewhat confounding that the author for some reason (intentionally or through ignorance) cannot simply call this what it is: momentum. Again, the lack of basic high school familiarity with the topics that seem to be the entire foundation of the book does not inspire confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the start of chapter 7, the author shows confusion between the Big Bang and the formation of planets (entirely distinct and unrelated events). From there, he dismisses the Big Bang simply because he cannot understand it because it contradicts his notion that time must have always existed. Thus, this is an argument from ignorance built on an argument of ignorance. It is doubly worthless. But with the Big Bang rejected out of hand, the author now tries desperately to make a model for a Steady State universe. Take a look at this train wreck:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author plays with scenarios in which, for no apparent reason, the Sun's gravity magically increases. The result:&lt;blockquote&gt;All of the planets and their satellites, asteroids, meteoroids, and everything else in our Solar system will fall onto the Sun and such a collision will produce ... [a]n extremely huge explosion (most probably, that's what science calls a nova or a supernova) or a series of smaller explosions. Any of these explosions might lead to the creation of a new reaction because Earth, the other planets, satellites, asteroids, etc. will provide a new fuel (all of them will burn.) In other words it may may lead to the creation of a new sun. If there are some broken off pieces - they might create new planets and satellites. Thus, the process of creation of the new solar system takes off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;*Blink*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where to start?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) No, that's not a supernova or nova. If those happened that way, the vaporized planets would be readily visible in the spectra. They're not. Doesn't fit the evidence. REJECT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Planets do not "burn" in any sense. They can be vaporized, but this is not burning. And even if it were,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Stars operate under &lt;i&gt;fusion&lt;/i&gt;. Planets like Jupiter have lots of hydrogen which can easily fuse, but there's a problem: a planet plopping on the sun only deposits the material on the &lt;i&gt;surface&lt;/i&gt; where the temperature is far too low to undergo fusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Explosions would take place certainly due to the kinetic impact, but its not going to throw off enough material (especially the right kinds of material) to form new planets at just the right trajectories to form stable orbits!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This shouldn't take that much thinking to realize. But the author again plays to ignorance saying: "Please remember - you and I are not astrophysicists or astronomers".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, but I AM!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His other scenario involves the Sun's gravity magically turning off. In this scenario, planets would (correctly) drift off from their parent stars until (potentially) captured by other solar systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really don't think the author appreciates the size of the universe and just how empty it is, even on a galactic scale. In in the author's fictional eternal universe, sure, &lt;i&gt;eventually&lt;/i&gt; they would be captured, but what are the odds of getting planetary systems formed in a set of damn near planar orbits like we have in our own solar system? Not happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Probability" it the title of chapter 8, but it would be more accurately named "Pulling numbers out of my ass".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 9 is about "Circumstances" and starts with a few sentences on why each planet can't sustain life. For all the pop-sci I suspect the author watches, I'm amazed he hasn't heard all the inferences on the potential for (primitive) life on Mars. Or on any of Jupiter's moons. He then claims that the asteroid belt was a destroyed planet, again invoking an argument from ignorance (where else did they all come from?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He closes the chapter making the absolutely bizarre claim that, the "more we learn about life - the less complicated it becomes".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't imagine the author could make it into an sort of college level Bio course. I didn't take any, but I've heard the rumors of Organic Chem. It's not simple. It's complex. What we &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; learned is that it's not &lt;i&gt;magical&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 10 is a screed against the notion of God. It's the best part of the book so far. The short version of it is that the concept of an omnibenevolent God is obviously incompatible with the way the world works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next chapter, the author takes some time to do a quick review and then chapter 12 is a summary of evolution. It's pretty much right although shows some bias in anthrocentrism with claims that brain (especially big ones) are an imperative for life. With little reason or evidence, he deems this sufficient and moves on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In chapter 13 he engages in come Creationist-esque logic demanding that there be some magical division between humans and animals. He claims that evolution is (somehow) insufficient to bridge this gap using some bizarre chicken and egg argument that makes little sense. Apparently he thinks that developing conscious thought takes conscious thought. The notion that conscious thought could be the result of evolutionary processes is somehow completely missed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He claims, "scientists compared genetic materials of neanderthals and modern humans.... they do not match." Obviously this book is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/neandertal.php"&gt;missing out on some important information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there, it's the whole canard about humans only using 10% of their brains. Which in the author's world means that we're all geniuses and means&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(wait for it......)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're Intelligently Designed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*headdesk*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 14 explains: Assuming (incorrectly) that population growth will go on unbounded, humans will be forced to venture out into the cosmos since there will simply be no further space or resources here. And if we do that, the author presumes we'll create "a new human species using our DNA".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, we intelligently designed ourselves...... and then abandoned ourselves without any sort of technology. I think the author watched a the last episode of Battlestar Galactica a few too many times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, this all begs the question: If pre-human humans are filling the cosmos with new versions of ourselves, why has SETI not detected anything yet? (Incidentally, the other book I'm reading it &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eerie-Silence-Renewing-Search-Intelligence/dp/0547133243/"&gt;Eerie Silence&lt;/a&gt; on that very topic which seeks to answer why we haven't heard from ETs, but none of the explanations are really compatible with the scenario laid out in this book.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the grand conclusion of the book so far put together through a string of logical fallacies:&lt;br&gt;1. The universe must be infinitely old because I can't imagine it otherwise.&lt;br&gt;2. I can't understand how humans could have evolved.&lt;br&gt;3. Thus, since time is infinite, so are humans and we can create ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 15 attempts to answer the question of why the pre-human humans that apparently created us didn't leave us anything. The author claims they did. They left us a library of infinite knowledge (or at least everything they knew). And he knows where it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's in our DNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah.... it's a code to a secret library.... Like the DaVinci Code.... But with genetics....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shame that it's subject to all sorts of random mutations, insertions from retroviruses and other distortions that it's probably a bunch of gobbly gook now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the author doesn't seem to realize this and &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; thinks that this magical library of knowledge has a plan. And it's tailored explicitly to you....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess the author doesn't realize how heredity works and that the collection of genes and chromosomes we get is &lt;i&gt;random&lt;/i&gt;, making this "plan" as accurate as a horoscope. Again, the author apparently didn't master high school science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the end of "Part 1".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 1 of the second section is a rant against religion that I skimmed over. In chapter 2, the author claims that we're subconsciously in touch with this library of knowledge, but some people more than others. Those that are more in touch are the successful Bill Gates' of the world. Those that aren't are the masses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Chapter 3, the author discusses failures and success. Of failures he blames everyone else, saying that with all your friends and families pulling you in their own directions, you can't go anywhere. Of success, he simply states that if at first you don't succeed, "[a]ll you have to do is to try, and try, and try, and try again."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don't worry about it. Once you've tapped into the cosmic knowledge fountain, you'll be riding the gravy train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 4 is all about "Goals". Basically, it's asking what do we do with our lives when we aren't busy procreating to make more humans (which is apparently the meaning of life). The author says, "Our creators knew perfectly well that nobody would go far on pure altruism." (Where altruism is being defined as making more human spawn to fill the rest of the cosmos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not sure why our creators would know this given it's not a necessary condition. If they created us, they could have made us 100% altruistic. But they didn't. Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strike&gt;God&lt;/strike&gt; The Creator works in mysterious ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, there's some more touchy feel good crap along the lines of the "Aim for the stars and even if you miss, you'll still get the moon" junk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 5 is all about maintaining a positive attitude all the time. Yay rainbows coming out of your ass nonsense! And how do you do this? More self help book nonsense about positive visualization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 6 is a review of all the metaphysics rubbish: If you want to succeed, get in touch with your magic data center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 7 is about the value of thinking. I'd agree with this. However, sometimes before one does too much thinking, it's helpful to actually do some learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next chapter is two pages long. It's basically more self-help nonsense: You have to be &lt;i&gt;obsessed&lt;/i&gt; with what you want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 9 covers faith. The author lambastes blind faith yet, ironically, it's exactly what he uses to build up the entire argument so far. It's blind faith that drives him to claim that, just because he can't imagine something, reality must be what he &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; imagine. Fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the author praises informed faith which he calls "real faith". This I can get behind. I appreciate the distinction that so many theists miss so they can hide behind equivocations of the term.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the author dips right back into bizarro land in chapter 10 in which he claims that people hearing voices aren't really crazy. They're just getting an overload of information by being &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; in touch with the super information repository. His evidence for this? A guy in a mental institution who was good at math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently all you have to do to tap into this information storehouse is to do a lot of visualization. Just picture it, and become completely OCD about making it happen, and it will!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 11 again summarizes all the faulty logic before moving on to chapter 12 which tries to illustrate the whole process in action. In specific, the author discusses Einstein:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was very educated in physics and mathematics (&lt;u&gt;understanding&lt;/u&gt;.) Space, energy, mass, and time questions - that is all he thought about (&lt;u&gt;real thinking&lt;/u&gt;). He did not care about his job in the patent bureau and he had even neglected his family in favor of those questions (&lt;u&gt;obsession&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;persistence&lt;/u&gt;. Instead of going home after work, he was pacing the streets and his mind was filled with imaginary pictures of possible answers (&lt;u&gt;visualization&lt;/u&gt;.) He did not have any doubts that one day he will [sic] solve these problems (&lt;u&gt;faith&lt;/u&gt;) and he finally did.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Does this whole thing reek of confirmation bias to anyone else? The author takes a success story and shoe horns it into his paradigm without bothering to assess counter examples of people who went through the same steps (those underlined) and failed utterly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 13 goes through how using this magic system will produce good habits and lead to good health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapter 14 is the summary of the entire book and not even worth mentioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking stock of the book as a whole: It's a bunch of metaphysical gibberish based on false premises born out of logical fallacies. It's nonsense on par with Creationists. The logical flaws are so astoundingly blatant, I'd be amazed that anyone engaging in a bit of critical thinking, or with any background knowledge to the topics would be taken in. Yet, the two other reviews of this book I could find online both found it compelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://exfundy.wordpress.com/2010/04/27/book-review-you-will-be-forced-to-become-wealthy/"&gt;One review&lt;/a&gt; said, "the book’s strongest point is the writer’s eagerness to help readers understand that there is no god". As I pointed out before, the argument against god(s) laid out in this book is simply because the author finds no need for them given his (erroneous) understanding of the history of the universe. Knowledge through misinformation is not something I can encourage. Especially for something that is such a minor part of the overall narrative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenewbookreview.blogspot.com/2009/12/forced-to-become-wealthy.html"&gt;The other&lt;/a&gt; review I found says, "the book is dedicated to discussing those questions we all always wonder about, especially today, in a day when there are so many more people questioning religion and faith." This claim is outright frightening to me. Sure, it asks the questions, but the answers are pure rubbish. Yet the reviewer says this book has her "convinced".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really? I mean &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asking questions is good. But at least put some thought into the response you get!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Sigh*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only other thing I want to say about this book is that the whole publishing and promoting seems highly suspicious. The author simply refers to himself by the pseudonym FINIFID which stands for "Friend In Need Is a Friend In Deed". Cute and in and of itself, I wouldn't find it suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's something else that seemed odd. &lt;a href="http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/blog/?page_id=2"&gt;Comment 235, by Mark Ofshtein at this blog&lt;/a&gt; claims that Mark is the publisher and he was "presented with a manuscript by an unknown author." In his Email to me, asking if I'd like a copy, Mark again identifies himself as the publisher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, in his Email to me asking for my thoughts recently, Mark identifies the book as his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On that same link to the "Why Won't God Heal Amputees" blog, Mark asks that criticisms be given in private. In the book, FINIFID repeatedly claims these revelations are meant only for the person given the book. In both cases, there's a creepy sense of cultish secrecy. However, I've maintained a policy of addressing things without shying away from them. Good work I'll praise publicly, but if one wants that, they must also risk public humiliation. That's how fair exchange of information works. I appreciate the amount of work it takes to write a 300 page book, but effort isn't everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I were to take anything out of that, it would be a final confirmation of the intellectual vacuity of the entire premise of the book. If the magical source of knowledge were truly available, and the author were so in tune with it, this book should be an intellectual masterpiece topping the best seller list. But it's not. It's being peddled to bloggers who &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jennifurret/status/11948994466"&gt;think it's crazy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hemantmehta/status/11952990901"&gt;toss it aside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Mark really FINIFID; Hiding behind the mask of a publisher promoting his own work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't say, but everything about this book, from the content, to the publishing, to the random bolding and underlining (often seen by religious nuts) both in the book and on the &lt;a href="http://www.ageoflogic.com/"&gt;publisher's website&lt;/a&gt; points to the person behind it being more than a little off their rocker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's great to keep an open mind, but that doesn't mean that you should let your brain get soggy when it rains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;UPDATE: The author has responded in the comments. My response to him is &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2010/05/response-to-finifid.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8767175669629115910?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274771968858"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5285">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/180cdb1da7c0fc85</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="Nutrition"/><category term="cardiovascular disease"/><category term="diabetes"/><category term="mortality"/><category term="processed meats"/><category term="red meat"/><category term="vegetarians"/><title type="html">Red Meat: Is It Hazardous to Health?</title><published>2010-05-25T07:00:39Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T07:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5285" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Red meat consumption has been linked to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer (breast, colorectal, stomach, bladder, prostate, and lymphoma). There are plausible mechanisms: meat is a source of carcinogens, iron that may increase oxidative damage, and saturated fat. But correlation and plausibility are not enough to establish causation. Is red meat really dangerous? If so, how great is the risk? A couple of recent studies have tried to shed light on these questions, but they have raised more questions than they have answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;cite&gt;Circulation&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977v1"&gt;“Red and Processed Meat Consumption and Risk of Incident Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke, and Diabetes Mellitus. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,”&lt;/a&gt; by Micha, Wallace and Mozaffarian, is a systematic review of the literature. It analyzed 17 prospective cohort studies and 3 case-control studies, with a total of 1.2 million subjects. As far as I can judge, it appears to be a well-done systematic review with excellent methodology and multiple precautions. They even looked for things like publication bias (which they did not find).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the &lt;strong&gt;consumption of processed meats, but not red meats, is associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt; (Processed meats include bacon, sausage, ham, hot dogs, salami, luncheon meat and other cured meats.) The increased risk per 50 gram serving of processed meats per day was 42% for heart disease and 19% for diabetes. Unprocessed red meats were not associated with CHD and were associated with a nonsignificant trend towards higher risk of diabetes. They found no association with stroke, but this was based only on 3 studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They commented that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…each of these individual studies has potential limitations, and our findings should be interpreted in that context. On the other hand, this represents the most complete worldwide evidence to date of the potential effects of red and processed meat consumption on incidence of CHD, stroke, and diabetes mellitus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Large Study of Meat and Mortality&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2009 study in the &lt;cite&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803089/?tool=pubmed"&gt;“Meat intake and mortality: a prospective study of over half a million people,”&lt;/a&gt; by Sinha et al., was more comprehensive in that it looked at many different conditions like cancer and cardiovascular disease, and it measured various causes of mortality as well as all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The half a million subjects were 51-70 years old and were from various geographic locations in the US. They filled out a questionnaire that asked about their usual consumption of foods and drinks and portion sizes over the previous twelve months. Their diets were classified as high, medium or low risk meat diets based on the amount of red meat and white meat adjusted for energy, and they were split into two groups using median consumption as cutpoints. The study was prospective: it assessed diet first and then followed subjects for 10 years and recorded deaths and causes of death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It concluded that &lt;strong&gt;red and processed meat intakes were associated with modest increases in total mortality, cancer mortality and CVD mortality.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, those in the highest quintile of red meat intake tended to consume a slightly lower amount of white meat, but a higher amount of processed meat than those in the lowest quintile. Subjects who consumed more red meat tended to be married, more likely to be of non-Hispanic white ethnicity, more likely to be a current smoker, have a higher body mass index, and a higher daily intake of energy, total fat and saturated fat; whereas they tended to have a lower education level, were less physically active and consumed less fruits, vegetables, fiber and vitamin supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found an increased risk associated with accidental deaths with higher consumption of red meat in men but not in women. It’s hard to know how to interpret that. They found an inverse association for white meat intake: it appeared protective against total mortality, but there was a small increase in risk for CVD mortality in men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall hazard ratios for men ranged from 1.06 to 1.31 for red meat (increasing steadily by quintile of meat intake), .90 to.92 for white meat, and 1.01 to 1.16 for processed meats. The effect of red meat was greater than the effect of processed meats, which was opposite to the findings of the review in &lt;cite&gt;Circulation.&lt;/cite&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tried to correct for confounders. In the process, they found an increased risk with white meat consumption among never-smokers and commented that the reason was not readily apparent. I suspect that the reason was that if you look at a large enough number of subgroups you can always find an occasional chance correlation that is meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their data also showed that increased red meat consumption was correlated to smoking, lack of exercise, higher total calorie intake, higher body weight, higher total fat and saturated fat intake, lower intake of fruits, vegetables and fiber, and lower use of vitamin supplements. Could it be this constellation of factors, rather than red meat itself, that leads to higher mortality? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They estimated that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For overall mortality … 11% of deaths in men and 16% of deaths in women could be prevented if people decreased their red meat consumption to the level of intake in the first quintile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this can be determined from the data. They haven’t reliably ruled out all possible confounding factors and they don’t have any direct evidence that taking people with a high red meat intake and reducing their intake improves their longevity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about Vegetarians?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/70/3/516S"&gt;A recent study comparing vegetarians to non-vegetarians&lt;/a&gt; found that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 20% lower in occasional meat eaters, 34% lower in people who ate fish but not meat, 34% lower in lactoovovegetarians, and 26% lower in vegans. There were no significant differences between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, or all other causes combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19166134"&gt;Meta-analysis of several prospective studies&lt;/a&gt; showed no significant differences in the mortality caused by colorectal, stomach, lung, prostate or breast cancers and stroke between vegetarians and “health-conscious” nonvegetarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vegetarians, a decrease of ischemic heart disease mortality was observed probably due to lower total serum cholesterol levels, lower prevalence of obesity and higher consumption of antioxidants. Very probably, an ample consumption of fruits and vegetables and not the exclusion of meat make vegetarians healthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologic studies based on self-reporting and recall are not the most reliable form of evidence. What are we to make of all the confusing data?  The evidence is far from conclusive, but it suggests that it would be wise to limit our consumption of red meat. The evidence is not strong enough to support recommendations that we give up red meat entirely or become vegetarians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aristotle said “Moderation in all things.” Mom said “Eat your vegetables.” They were both right.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, it's true. Every so often I get really, really tired of the bad science, pseudoscience, magical thinking, misinformation, and even outright lies that emanate from various anti-vaccine websites and blogs. This week, I promised myself I would try not to do it. There are times when duty calls, and this is one of those times. For better or for worse, as hard as I still find it to believe, somehow I've become one of the top bloggers defending vaccines, and there are times when I have to stop whining and just embrace this role. Given the one-two-three triple whammy of the start of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5122"&gt;anti-vaccine autism quackfest Autism One&lt;/a&gt;, Andrew Wakefield having &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php"&gt;had his license to practice medicine in the U.K. yanked&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_refusers_proving_oracs_corollary_to.php"&gt;hilariously insane anti-vaccine rally&lt;/a&gt; to take place in Grant Park in Chicago tomorrow, it's time just to go with the flow and do what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today this is something I'm more than happy to do, at least today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing about the anti-vaccine movement that I've learned over the last several years, it's that it's nothing if not, for lack of a better word, nearly infinitely pliable. To put it more simply, anti-vaccine activists are experts at throwing out as much stuff as they can and seeing if anything sticks, adjusting their stories, and moving the goalposts every time each of their successive demands for more evidence are met by scientists. Although there has always been an anti-vaccine movement, its most recent incarnation is built primarily around the idea that vaccines cause autism somehow. First it was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/the_story_of_anti-vaccine_icon_andrew_wa.php"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; presenting dubious, trial lawyer-funded "research" purporting to show that the MMR vaccine causes "autistic enterocolitis" and even autism itself. Then, not long after that, the U.S. version of this manufactrovery showed up in the form of the concept that mercury in the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccines cause autism, promoted initially by &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/06/saloncom-flushes-its-credibility-down.html"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; Fortunately, more than a decade's worth of research consisting of large epidemiological studies has utterly failed to find even a whiff of a hint of a link between either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccine movement simply moved the goalposts to the "toxins" gambit, in which it is claimed that vaccines are laced with "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we.php"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;" such as formaldehyde, antifreeze, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/when_right_wing_nuts_try_to_do_science.php"&gt;tissue from aborted fetuses&lt;/a&gt;. Never mind that there are no parts from aborted fetuses or antifreeze in vaccines, and scary-sounding chemicals like formaldehyde are present in concentrations far too low to be a problem. Even so, "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/green_our_vaccines_celebrity_antivaccina.php"&gt;Green our Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;" sure sounds like a slogan that means something, even though it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest gambit, and arguably one of the most successful because it's the most vague and difficult to falsify, is the "Too Many Too Soon" slogan. Under this idea, anti-vaccine propagandists claim that infants are getting too many vaccines too soon (hence the slogan) and that all those nasty vaccines being given to such young infants is somehow messing up their immune system, attacking their brains, and giving them autism. This is a tough one to combat because the only definitive way to refute it would involve studying unvaccinated versus vaccinated children (which, not surprisingly, is the latest demand of the anti-vaccine movement). Doing such a study in a rigorous prospective randomized fashion would be completely unethical because it would leave the control group unprotected, while retrospective studies would be prone to a lot of confounders, given that there are likely to be other factors besides vaccination status that make populations who aren't vaccinated different from those who are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why a study hot off the presses yesterday (well, hot off the web, as it were, given that it's an E-pub ahead of print) is so well timed. Released right as Autism One starts and Andrew Wakefield tanks, what better time for a study to look right at the very question that anti-vaccinationists seem to want answered? The title of the article is even an arrow aimed right at the heart of the "too many too soon" mantra, namely &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-2489v1"&gt;On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/no_difference_between_too_many_too_soon.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/no_difference_between_too_many_too_soon.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/e79durzP7lg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274768466373"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5760">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe4044766ff3066a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Religion and Public Policy"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="homophobia"/><category term="Mississippi"/><category term="lesbians"/><category term="Constance McMillen"/><category term="Itawamba Agricultural High School"/><title type="html">Brief update on Constance McMillen</title><published>2010-05-25T06:20:57Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T06:20:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/brief-update-on-constance-mcmillen/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://d.yimg.com/a/p/ap/20100520/capt.32b505f7dbde4b988344d5839079745d-32b505f7dbde4b988344d5839079745d-0.jpg?x=213&amp;amp;y=347&amp;amp;xc=1&amp;amp;yc=1&amp;amp;wc=252&amp;amp;hc=410&amp;amp;q=85&amp;amp;sig=rlHK0z7WJFYjfLEihiM0xQ--"&gt;&lt;img src="http://d.yimg.com/a/p/ap/20100520/capt.32b505f7dbde4b988344d5839079745d-32b505f7dbde4b988344d5839079745d-0.jpg?x=213&amp;amp;y=347&amp;amp;xc=1&amp;amp;yc=1&amp;amp;wc=252&amp;amp;hc=410&amp;amp;q=85&amp;amp;sig=rlHK0z7WJFYjfLEihiM0xQ--" alt="" width="213" height="347"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You may remember Constance McMillen , the lesbian teen whose Mississippi high school sued her school district for discrimination when they wouldn’t allow her to wear a tuxedo and bring her girlfriend to the prom. The school then childishly announced that they wouldn’t even have a prom thanks to her until they invited her to a sham prom with fewer than ten other students in attendance while they held the real prom elsewhere so that they could humiliate her for the crime of being different, I guess. This led to an enormous amount of support for Constance from all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now there are two news stories about Constance. First, &lt;a href="http://www.365gay.com/news/lesbian-who-sued-over-prom-date-transfers-schools/"&gt;she’s transferred out of the  bigoted Itawamba Agricultural High School&lt;/a&gt; in Fulton and into a high school in Jackson. She’ll be graduating from the new high school on June 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, her old school district is &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100524/ap_on_re_us/us_lesbian_prom_date"&gt;denying they had anything to do with the ruse&lt;/a&gt;. Classy folks they have there in Fulton, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you will most likely have &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/05/24/martin-gardner-1914-2010/"&gt;heard the sad news&lt;/a&gt; of the death of Martin Gardner — the father of modern skepticism — at age 95. He was, as his friend James Randi &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/995-my-world-is-a-little-darker.html"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “a very bright spot in my firmament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people feel the same way, and for good reason. Gardner’s impact cannot be overstated. It is fair to argue that Martin Gardner created the modern skeptical literature from whole cloth. His 1952 book &lt;em&gt;In the Name of Science &lt;/em&gt;(retitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486203948?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;%20linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486203948"&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies in the Name of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for the second and subsequent editions; hereafter referred to as &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt;) set the standard that later led to the creation of CSICOP — and to all that has followed since. Through his books and his &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/archive/category/notes_of_a_fringe-watcher"&gt;“Notes of a Fringe-Watcher”&lt;/a&gt; column in the &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;, Martin Gardner was a meticulous skeptical scholar for &lt;em&gt;six decades.&lt;/em&gt; (Amazingly, his most recent &lt;em&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/em&gt; articles appeared earlier &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; year.)&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this essay about this &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/472686-martin-gardner-rest-in-peace-good-old-man"&gt;“good old man”&lt;/a&gt; in long-hand, sitting at the side of a neighbourhood swimming pool. I’m watching my own young son laughing and splashing, and thinking about life: its brevity, its preciousness, its cycles of wisdom and forgetfulness and rediscovery. How fleeting it can be — not only life, but memory and understanding as well. What will my son remember of the lessons I try to teach him? What will I remember of the things my own father taught me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/04/27/ode-to-joy/"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt; about the dawn of the organized skeptical movement with the formation of CSICOP in 1976. Today I’m looking back further — a whopping &lt;em&gt;24 years&lt;/em&gt; before the founding of CSICOP or any other skeptical organization. Gardner stepped onto the stage with &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies &lt;/em&gt;the year after Carl Sagan graduated &lt;em&gt;high school&lt;/em&gt;. James Randi was, at age 24, making a name for himself as a bright young magician. It was the year that Paul Kurtz, a U.S. Army veteran of the liberation of Dachau, finished his PhD in philosophy. Legendary investigator Joe Nickell, whose historical overview essay style follows the Gardner model, was an eight-year old boy. Many of our most respected science advocates, like Michael Shermer and Steven Novella, had not yet even been born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my part, my own father was three years old when Gardner invented the modern skeptical literature — with the book I dug into again this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486203948?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;%20linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486203948"&gt;&lt;img title="Fads_and_fallacies" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Fads_and_fallacies.jpg" alt="Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies cover art" width="250" height="368"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A True Classic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never met Martin Gardner, and it’s been years since I last re-read his books. Still, returning to &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt; is like speaking to a close old friend I haven’t seen in years. (When we were shepherds, my brother Jason and I used to carry battered copies of skeptical masterpieces in our backpacks. Sagan’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b045PB"&gt;Demon-Haunted World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Randi’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b001PB"&gt;Flim-Flam!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b001PB"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and Gardner’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486203948?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;%20linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486203948"&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were among the most important of them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t read &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt;, you should. (I mean, really, head down to your local library today. What better way to honor Gardner’s life in skepticism?) &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt; is a revered classic, of course, and yet completely modern in style as well as substance. Its crisp chapters each review the history and arguments of a specific pseudoscientific topic (such as creationist flood geology, Atlantis, or “orgone” energy), placing the development of that topic in context with its closest pseudoscientific relatives, and contrasting it with the relevant science. Gardner’s model is followed today by Joe Nickell, by Brian Dunning’s &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast, and of course by my own &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/"&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholarship of these articles is extremely impressive, and very certainly worth our effort to study. For years I’ve aggressively pursued primary sources for skeptical research, building a very respectable library on these obscure topics; and yet, a few minutes flipping through &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt; just now informed me about a half dozen obviously important volumes I didn’t know anything about. And I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; know about those books. Skeptics should know as much as we can of what Martin Gardner knew, because we’re the only people who can continue and build on his research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great lessons of skepticism is that weird ideas never go away. One of the functions of skeptics is the study of the history of claims and hoaxes, so that experts are available when those claims inevitably mutate or resurge. Readers of &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt; will learn, for example, not only what is wrong with the concept of dowsing (relevant all over again, and lethal, in the wake of the Iraq &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/middleeast/04sensors.html"&gt;bomb-detector scandal&lt;/a&gt;); about the key volumes and thinkers to develop the dowsing idea through the early 20th century (and before); and also about the related idea of radiesthesia (pendulum divining, which incidentally &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/junior_skeptic/issue23/translation_Bovis.html"&gt;gave birth to pyramid power&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gardner’s Blueprint&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its many virtues, &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt; stands out for its clarity as a blueprint for later skeptical research, organization, and activism. I’m somewhat known for a &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhereDoWeGoFromHere.pdf"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;-type essay advocating for traditional skepticism. I could have saved myself 5000 words if I’d just written, “What Martin Gardner said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first page, &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies &lt;/em&gt;is explicit about the problem it wants to address: the influence and dangers of pseudoscience. Gardner was concerned about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the rise of the promoter of new and strange “scientific” theories. He is riding into prominence, so to speak, on the coat-tails of reputable investigators. The scientists themselves, of course, pay very little attention to him. They are too busy with more important matters. But the less informed general public, hungry for sensational discoveries and quick panaceas, often provides him with a noisy and enthusiastic following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner saw this volatile combination — poor public science literacy; the existence of cranks and con men; and, the fact that pseudoscientific claims are typically left unexamined by serious scientists — as a call to action. It is a call others took up in the decades that followed. Today we call that project “scientific skepticism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why should anyone care about pseudoscience? Why is pseudoscience worth fighting? In every generation, skeptics ask themselves this question — a question Gardner anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we are making a mountain out of a molehill. It is all very amusing, one might say, to titillate public fancy with books about bee people from Mars. The scientists are not fooled, nor are readers who are scientifically informed. If the public wants to shell out cash for such flummery, what difference does it make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner offered several answers to this question. To begin with, he noted, there is a human cost “when people are misled by scientific claptrap.” He offered the sad example of mentally ill people “desperately in need of trained psychiatric care” whose treatment is delayed by “dalliance in crank cults.” (Lest you doubt Gardner’s relevance today, he was talking about Dianetics, the basis of Scientology. &lt;em&gt;Fads &amp;amp; Fallacies&lt;/em&gt; includes an in-depth chapter about Scientology’s history and claims.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that rock bottom truth — &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/"&gt;people get hurt&lt;/a&gt; — is ample reason for people of conscience to care about pseudoscience (especially medical pseudoscience). Nonetheless, Gardner provided other answers as well. One is that unchallenged pseudoscientific beliefs (even when apparently harmless) can reenforce other (perhaps more dangerous) unfounded beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the long-run effects of non-medical books like Velikovsky’s, and the treatises on flying saucers? It is hard to see how the effects can be anything but harmful. Who can say how many orthodox Christians and Jews read &lt;em&gt;Worlds in Collision&lt;/em&gt; and drifted back into a cruder Biblicism because they were told that science had reaffirmed the Old Testament miracles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To appreciate the prescience of this comment, consider that Answers In Genesis still finds it necessary to include on its list of “&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/get-answers/topic/arguments-we-dont-use"&gt;Arguments That Should Never Be Used”&lt;/a&gt; the Velikovskian notion that the Earth stopped rotating for a day during the life of the Old Testament figure Joshua. Check out their surprisingly good &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/1117.asp"&gt;debunking article&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of Joshua’s missing day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, Gardner argued, pseudoscience erodes scientific literacy in general — a process as unpredictable as it is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An even more regrettable effect produced by the publication of scientific rubbish is the confusion they sow in the minds of gullible readers about what is and what isn’t scientific knowledge. And the more the public is confused, the easier it falls prey to doctrines of pseudo-science which may at some future date receive the backing of politically powerful groups. As we shall see in later chapters, a renaissance of German quasi-science paralleled the rise of Hitler. If the German people had been better trained to distinguish good from bad science, would they have swallowed so easily the insane racial theories of the Nazi anthropologists?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gardner’s Solution, and Legacy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was Martin Gardner’s solution to the problem of pseudoscience? The first step is implicit in his decades of painstaking work: scholarship. To tackle pseudoscience knowledgeably, skeptics take on (to greater or lesser extents) the task of becoming scholars of pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a colossal project. Skepticism’s traditional subject matter includes hundreds of pseudoscientific and paranormal topics — each with its own literature, history of development, major figures and major works, and collection of critical responses. Sometimes, as with homeopathy or astrology or dowsing, the history of a single topic stretches back &lt;em&gt;centuries&lt;/em&gt;. Martin Gardner researched that vast field for decades, acquiring a depth of knowledge and understanding that is unparalleled among living skeptics. It is left to each of us to fill some small, specialized part of the gap he has left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1952, Gardner showed us what skeptical scholarship looks like, setting the standard that skeptical researchers follow today. At the same time, he called for the now-traditional other half of the skeptical coin: working to advance scientific literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need better science education in our schools. We need more and better popularizers of science. We need better channels of communication between working scientists and the public. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on. The road always continues — and eventually, the travelers do not. Martin Gardner lived to see his personal call to arms grow into a lively research field, an activism movement, and even (through skepticism’s digital renaissance) a flourishing global subculture. It’s a wonderful legacy. For a time, it is ours to preserve. And so, tonight I’ll be raising a glass to the memory of Martin Gardner — and thinking hard about the things he had to teach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Loxton</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274763183769"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=5754">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81bfacca4bc596a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="Andrew Wakefield"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Matt Lauer"/><category term="MMR"/><category term="Today Show"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">Wakefield gets a wake up call</title><published>2010-05-25T04:52:51Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T04:52:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/wakefield-gets-a-wake-up-call/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.canpages.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dr-evil.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.canpages.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dr-evil.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="238"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s done. Andrew Wakefield &lt;a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/Wakefield_SPM_and_SANCTION.pdf_32595267.pdf"&gt;has been officially stuck off the UK’s medical registry&lt;/a&gt;. The General Medical Council &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off"&gt;has stripped him of the medical license&lt;/a&gt;, which he used as a license to kill. The GMC has called Wakefield “dishonest”, “misleading” and  “irresponsible” in his research into the MMR vaccine and its purported  links to autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Wakefield was proud to tell Matt Lauer&lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/vp/37312715#37312715"&gt; on The Today Show this morning&lt;/a&gt; that he can still  technically be called “doctor” because the GMC can’t take away his degree. So in that case, from now on I’m to be called “Master” because that’s what my degree says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of The Today Show, I’m damned proud of Lauer for coming through. Sure, he’s no Anderson Cooper or Mike Wallace, but he really laid into Wakefield. It wasn’t as good as the infamous Tom Cruise segment but it was still pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one big criticism was that I’d wished Matt had responded to Wakefield’s baseless claims that the government has conceded that vaccines cause autism. I assume this is Wakefield’s spin on the the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/the_hannah_poling_case_and_the_rebrandin.php"&gt;Hannah   Poling&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;Bailey   Banks&lt;/a&gt; cases. I wish Matt has explained that court settlements do not mean that one party has conceded fault. If it did, then why would the opposing party accept the settlement? In other words, if the other party is losing, wouldn’t you rather win the whole case than accept some compromise? And given that a settlement is a compromise, couldn’t you just as easily argue that it’s the other side that conceded? No, settling a case does not mean one party has admitted fault. It’s usually just a mutually agreed upon compromise to avoid a lengthy trial, which nobody wants. It just shows that Wakefield is about as ignorant or delusional of the legal system as he is about medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it isn’t likely to change many people’s minds. The vaccine denial community has already gone overdrive into spin mode to inexplicably portray the GMC hearings as a “kangaroo court” and a “witch hunt” even though Wakefield never backed up his claims with substantive evidence during the whole two years the hearings were going on. So he’ll still somehow continue to be a leader in their movement despite the fact that at least publicly, he’s in favor of most vaccines. Some people will simply never been convinced that vaccines are safe and effective no matter what the evidence says. And sadly, I fear we haven’t heard the last of Mr. Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;

about &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/08/running-in-rain.html"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/a_tale_of_two_diets.php"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt;?  Remember??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, me neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's because over the last 16 months my life has completely spun out of control.  Science is exploding, Little Isis is a little boy now with activities and even more needs, and I am trying to keep my marriage some reasonable degree of healthy.  In the time it took me to write the above nonsense, my phone has rung 4 times.  The only way I have been able to get through every day has been to cut back on the things I was doing for myself.  Mostly blogging and running.  This hasn't been good.  In the last 16 months I have gained about 20 pounds.  Mama's not proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve really needed a kick in the ass to get back to business.  I had been prepared to do something drastic.  I even considered changing my little muffins to my little celerys to cut calories, but it seems cruel to punish you all for my bad behavior.  Instead, I went out for a run yesterday on one of my favorite 5 mile routes.  It hurt Mama bad, but I needed to do it.  I wore my running clothes in to work today to try to coerce myself to do it again. I keep telling myself that eventually this won&amp;#39;t hurt so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tired runner.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/tired%20runner.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="298" height="167"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://couch2marathon.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/tired_runner.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;b&gt;But we all know that&amp;#39;s crap, right?  As soon as this stops hurting I&amp;#39;ll do something to make it hurt again.  That&amp;#39;s the point of running, right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve known that I&amp;#39;ve needed a kick in the pants to get my life back in order.  That&amp;#39;s why it was so timely to receive this question from one of you lovely people...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Isis, &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
HOW did you pick yourself up after the hit on your work from having a child? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I feel so much like the weak link in my lab--partly that's because there are really amazing people in this lab and they're doing super-cool stuff, but in large part it's because I've been dealing with [the arrival of my baby]. I'm working far fewer hours than I did during graduate school (~40 vs ~55). My brain is only just now beginning to come back on board, in some regards--and even now I struggle for common words and phrases, let alone major scientific concepts. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know I should cut myself some slack, and I do. But sometimes the slack-cutting has the wrong effect--I end up not getting as much done at work as I should, or I give up on small projects really quickly because it's hard. I see myself falling behind my (all male) colleagues, and though I knew intellectually that would be one result of having a child--man, it's really hard to take in reality. Even though I have a nice project wrapping up right now, I can see things that if I'd pushed harder on, I might have kicked this project up a rung. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basically, I feel like I'm doing worse at work than I expected, even given the reduction in hours. Any thoughts on this experience? Or if now is the time when you point and laugh and say Didn't you even READ blogs? that's ok too. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Friday I realized that on our entire floor, consisting of three major labs, I am one of two female postdocs. The isolation IRL is undoubtedly relevant. I'm so grateful to have the bloggysphere.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Coming back to work after having a baby is really, really hard. If you&amp;#39;re nursing, your day is interrupted by routine milkings.  I had a really time returning to focus after a bout of pumping nourishment out via my nipples. Add on top of this sleep deprivation and the impact on your productivity can be massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="milking cows.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/milking%20cows.jpg" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0pt auto 20px" width="375" height="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.caes.uga.edu/extension/anr/gaagres/images/dairy.jpg"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;: An artist's rendition of Dr. Isis, returning to work after Little Isis's birth.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, none the less, here are some of my ideas for returning to work post-baby...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fix Your Sleep First.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; If you are not getting regular, productive sleep, it is really difficult to be able to honestly and rationally assess your progress.  It is also almost impossible to motivate yourself to take on a challenging task.  To this day, when Little Isis has a rough night, it leaves me a total mess the next day. When Little Isis was a baby Mr. Isis and I took turns getting up with him.  I frequently co-slept with Little Isis because it was less disturbing to my sleep to let him nurse than it was to get up and get him in the middle of the night. I tried to use my pumping time to catch a bit of sleep. But, mostly, once I was able to get 6 uninterrupted hours, my life improved immensely. Even the &lt;a title="Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education" href="http://scienceblogs.com/wiki/Accreditation_Council_for_Graduate_Medical_Education"&gt;Accreditation 
Council for Graduate Medical Education&lt;/a&gt; has had the good sense to limit medical residents to one on call night every three days because working in a high stress job with lack of sleep increases the number of errors they make and decreases response time.  I don&amp;#39;t see new mothers as being any different, and yet there are no advocacy groups for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again I say, fix your sleep first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Set Realistic Goals and Find a Sounding Board.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Sometimes I have a really hard time evaluating my own progress.  That&amp;#39;s why I have developed some relationships with trusted people to give me honest feedback on my productivity.  One of the challenges while still nursing is to design experiments that allow you to walk away from the bench for periods on end, which is why it is important to set realistic goals in advance.  Sometimes I feel like I am failing at life, science, and motherhood, but a consultation with one of these trusted colleagues can highlight how much I have actually accomplished.  It can also give me a kick in the pants when I need it.  I also think its important to establish relationships with other mothers, especially when the numbers of mothers in academia can be small.  The mothers in my life are fantastic listeners with an uncanny ability to put my life in perspective and tell me when I am taking myself too seriously.  They are also people who would take care of Little Isis in a pinch - like when science is going awry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn When to Say No.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;  This is something I am not always good at, but scientist mothers frequently have to perform similarly to their childless colleagues in fewer hours. For me, that has meant cutting the bullshit out of my life in order to focus on what&amp;#39;s important.    Recently though, the professional bullshit has started to creep in and I have had to be reminded to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; more often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week I was having trouble with science.  On top of it, my car was being repaired and I needed someone to drive some things for one of our experiments.  Normally Dr. Triple Threat cycles 10 miles to and from work, but I called to ask if he would be willing to drive.  He said, in no uncertain terms, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; because it would prevent his ability to exercise that day.  At first I was pretty cheesed that he wouldn&amp;#39;t help me, but after a day or two I began to appreciate why he said &amp;quot;no,&amp;quot; and even admire his ability to do it.  Dr. Triple Threat placed value a goal and was willing to achieve it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, most important is to fix your sleep.  Everything else in the world will improve when you&amp;#39;re well rested again,  And best of luck with the little one!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/05/ask_dr_isis_-_picking_it_up_af.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/X69o-YvJudY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274761560049"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75242d3ca1ebc11f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Charley's Browned</title><published>2010-05-25T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/charleys.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did a Charley's Grilled Subs outlet in Stockton, California, refuse service to two U.S. Marines?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274759210657"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/jennifer_ouellette_matchmaker.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/705d059f81bb7659</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Education"/><title type="html">Jennifer Ouellette: Matchmaker for Hollywood and science (video)</title><published>2010-05-25T01:38:11Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T01:38:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/GoVi5745QVA/jennifer_ouellette_matchmaker.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/jennifer_ouellette_matchmaker.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/o1SA7xXs8no%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=360" width="580" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010797" title=""&gt;Torpor on Demand: Heterothermy in the Non-Lemur Primate Galago moholi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hibernation and daily torpor are energy- and water-saving adaptations employed to survive unfavourable periods mostly in temperate and arctic environments, but also in tropical and arid climates. Heterothermy has been found in a number of mammalian orders, but within the primates so far it seems to be restricted to one family of Malagasy lemurs. As currently there is no evidence of heterothermy of a primate outside of Madagascar, the aim of our study was to investigate whether small primates from mainland Africa are indeed always homeothermic despite pronounced seasonal changes in weather and food availability. One of the nearest relatives of Malagasy lemurs, the African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, which inhabits a highly seasonal habitat with a hot wet-season and a cold dry-season with lower food abundance, was investigated to determine whether it is capable of heterothermy. We measured skin temperature of free-ranging individuals throughout the cool dry season using temperature-sensitive collars as well as metabolic rate in captured individuals. Torpor was employed by 15% of 20 animals. Only one of these animals displayed heterothermy in response to natural availability of food and water, whereas the other animals became torpid without access to food and water. Our results show that G. moholi are physiologically capable of employing torpor. However they do not use it as a routine behaviour, but only under adverse conditions. This reluctance is presumably a result of conflicting selective pressures for energy savings versus other ecological and evolutionary forces, such as reproduction or territory defence. Our results support the view that heterothermy in primates evolved before the division of African and Malagasy Strepsirhini, with the possible implication that more primate species than previously thought might still have the potential to call upon this possibility, if the situation necessitates it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010798" title=""&gt;Marginal Eyespots on Butterfly Wings Deflect Bird Attacks Under Low Light Intensities with UV Wavelengths&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function. Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions--in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010806" title=""&gt;Targeted Manipulation of Serotonergic Neurotransmission Affects the Escalation of Aggression in Adult Male Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) are reported to serve important roles in aggression in a wide variety of animals. Previous investigations of 5HT function in adult Drosophila behavior have relied on pharmacological manipulations, or on combinations of genetic tools that simultaneously target both DA and 5HT neurons. Here, we generated a transgenic line that allows selective, direct manipulation of serotonergic neurons and asked whether DA and 5HT have separable effects on aggression. Quantitative morphological examination demonstrated that our newly generated tryptophan hydroxylase (TRH)-Gal4 driver line was highly selective for 5HT-containing neurons. This line was used in conjunction with already available Gal4 driver lines that target DA or both DA and 5HT neurons to acutely alter the function of aminergic systems. First, we showed that acute impairment of DA and 5HT neurotransmission using expression of a temperature sensitive form of dynamin completely abolished mid- and high-level aggression. These flies did not escalate fights beyond brief low-intensity interactions and therefore did not yield dominance relationships. We showed next that manipulation of either 5HT or DA neurotransmission failed to duplicate this phenotype. Selective disruption of 5HT neurotransmission yielded flies that fought, but with reduced ability to escalate fights, leading to fewer dominance relationships. Acute activation of 5HT neurons using temperature sensitive dTrpA1 channel expression, in contrast, resulted in flies that escalated fights faster and that fought at higher intensities. Finally, acute disruption of DA neurotransmission produced hyperactive flies that moved faster than controls, and rarely engaged in any social interactions. By separately manipulating 5HT- and DA- neuron systems, we collected evidence demonstrating a direct role for 5HT in the escalation of aggression in Drosophila.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010791" title=""&gt;Loss and Recovery Potential of Marine Habitats: An Experimental Study of Factors Maintaining Resilience in Subtidal Algal Forests at the Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Predicting and abating the loss of natural habitats present a huge challenge in science, conservation and management. Algal forests are globally threatened by loss and severe recruitment failure, but our understanding of resilience in these systems and its potential disruption by anthropogenic factors lags well behind other habitats. We tested hypotheses regarding triggers for decline and recovery potential in subtidal forests of canopy-forming algae of the genus Cystoseira. By using a combination of historical data, and quantitative in situ observations of natural recruitment patterns we suggest that recent declines of forests along the coasts of the north Adriatic Sea were triggered by increasing cumulative impacts of natural- and human-induced habitat instability along with several extreme storm events. Clearing and transplantation experiments subsequently demonstrated that at such advanced stages of ecosystem degradation, increased substratum stability would be essential but not sufficient to reverse the loss, and that for recovery to occur removal of the new dominant space occupiers (i.e., opportunistic species including turf algae and mussels) would be required. Lack of surrounding adult canopies did not seem to impair the potential for assisted recovery, suggesting that in these systems recovery could be actively enhanced even following severe depletions. We demonstrate that sudden habitat loss can be facilitated by long term changes in the biotic and abiotic conditions in the system, that erode the ability of natural ecosystems to absorb and recover from multiple stressors of natural and human origin. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mere restoration of environmental conditions preceding a loss, if possible, may be insufficient for ecosystem restoration, and is scarcely cost-effective. We conclude that the loss of complex marine habitats in human-dominated landscapes could be mitigated with appropriate consideration and management of incremental habitat changes and of attributes facilitating system recovery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010785" title=""&gt;Phylogenetic Evidence for Lateral Gene Transfer in the Intestine of Marine Iguanas&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lateral gene transfer (LGT) appears to promote genotypic and phenotypic variation in microbial communities in a range of environments, including the mammalian intestine. However, the extent and mechanisms of LGT in intestinal microbial communities of non-mammalian hosts remains poorly understood. We sequenced two fosmid inserts obtained from a genomic DNA library derived from an agar-degrading enrichment culture of marine iguana fecal material. The inserts harbored 16S rRNA genes that place the organism from which they originated within Clostridium cluster IV, a well documented group that habitats the mammalian intestinal tract. However, sequence analysis indicates that 52% of the protein-coding genes on the fosmids have top BLASTX hits to bacterial species that are not members of Clostridium cluster IV, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least 10 of 44 coding genes on the fosmids may have been transferred from Clostridium cluster XIVa to cluster IV. The fosmids encoded four transposase-encoding genes and an integrase-encoding gene, suggesting their involvement in LGT. In addition, several coding genes likely involved in sugar transport were probably acquired through LGT. Our phylogenetic evidence suggests that LGT may be common among phylogenetically distinct members of the phylum Firmicutes inhabiting the intestinal tract of marine iguanas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010783" title=""&gt;Morphological and Molecular Characterizations of Psychrophilic Fungus Geomyces destructans from New York Bats with White Nose Syndrome (WNS)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Massive die-offs of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) have been occurring since 2006 in hibernation sites around Albany, New York, and this problem has spread to other States in the Northeastern United States. White cottony fungal growth is seen on the snouts of affected animals, a prominent sign of White Nose Syndrome (WNS). A previous report described the involvement of the fungus Geomyces destructans  in WNS, but an identical fungus was recently isolated in France from a bat that was evidently healthy. The fungus has been recovered sparsely despite plentiful availability of afflicted animals. We have investigated 100 bat and environmental samples from eight affected sites in 2008. Our findings provide strong evidence for an etiologic role of G. destructans in bat WNS. (i) Direct smears from bat snouts, Periodic Acid Schiff-stained tissue sections from infected tissues, and scanning electron micrographs of bat tissues all showed fungal structures similar to those of G. destructans. (ii) G. destructans DNA was directly amplified from infected bat tissues, (iii) Isolations of G. destructans in cultures from infected bat tissues showed 100% DNA match with the fungus present in positive tissue samples. (iv) RAPD patterns for all G. destructans cultures isolated from two sites were indistinguishable. (v) The fungal isolates showed psychrophilic growth. (vi) We identified in vitro proteolytic activities suggestive of known fungal pathogenic traits in G. destructans. Further studies are needed to understand whether G. destructans WNS is a symptom or a trigger for bat mass mortality. The availability of well-characterized G. destructans strains should promote an understanding of bat-fungus relationships, and should aid in the screening of biological and chemical control agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010771" title=""&gt;A Three-Dimensional Atlas of the Honeybee Neck&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three-dimensional digital atlases are rapidly becoming indispensible in modern biology. We used serial sectioning combined with manual registration and segmentation of images to develop a comprehensive and detailed three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee head-neck system. This interactive atlas includes skeletal structures of the head and prothorax, the neck musculature, and the nervous system. The scope and resolution of the model exceeds atlases previously developed on similar sized animals, and the interactive nature of the model provides a far more accessible means of interpreting and comprehending insect anatomy and neuroanatomy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010773" title=""&gt;The Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS), a New Set of 480 Normative Photos of Objects to Be Used as Visual Stimuli in Cognitive Research&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are currently stimuli with published norms available to study several psychological aspects of language and visual cognitions. Norms represent valuable information that can be used as experimental variables or systematically controlled to limit their potential influence on another experimental manipulation. The present work proposes 480 photo stimuli that have been normalized for name, category, familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. Stimuli are also available in grayscale, blurred, scrambled, and line-drawn version. This set of objects, the Bank Of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS), was created specifically to meet the needs of scientists in cognition, vision and psycholinguistics who work with photo stimuli.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010780" title=""&gt;Genomic Diversity and Introgression in O. sativa Reveal the Impact of Domestication and Breeding on the Rice Genome&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The domestication of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) was a complex process punctuated by episodes of introgressive hybridization among and between subpopulations. Deep genetic divergence between the two main varietal groups (Indica and Japonica) suggests domestication from at least two distinct wild populations. However, genetic uniformity surrounding key domestication genes across divergent subpopulations suggests cultural exchange of genetic material among ancient farmers. In this study, we utilize a novel 1,536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice. Our population structure analyses support the existence of five major subpopulations (indica, aus, tropical japonica, temperate japonica and GroupV) consistent with previous analyses. Our introgression analysis shows that most accessions exhibit some degree of admixture, with many individuals within a population sharing the same introgressed segment due to artificial selection. Admixture mapping and association analysis of amylose content and grain length illustrate the potential for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in domesticated plant populations. Genes in these regions control a myriad of traits including plant stature, blast resistance, and amylose content.

As this argument has unraveled, they have called for &amp;quot;vaccinated vs. unvaccinated&amp;quot; studies, prospective studies which follow children who are and are not vaccinated and look at different rates of autism.  Epidemiologists have been all over the question of causation, but not surprisingly, the antivax crowd hasn&amp;#39;t been satisfied with them to date.  The new study adds another layer of evidence to what we already know: vaccines do not cause autism.  But this study goes one step further and asks the question, &amp;quot;is it really &amp;#39;too many too soon?&amp;#39;&amp;quot; The study&amp;#39;s conclusion is in its title: &amp;quot;On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes.&amp;quot;  The authors used vaccine data from several thousand children.  They compared children who followed the recommended vaccination schedule in the first year of life vs. those who did not, and compared neurological outcomes 7-10 years later.  The data were unequivocal: there were no significant neurologic problems present in the &amp;quot;off-schedule&amp;quot; group compared to the on-time group.  This very strongly argues against &amp;quot;too many too soon&amp;quot;.  There are two rational complaints likely to be raised by the antivaccination crowd.  One is potential conflicts of interests in the authors.  Both authors have disclosed various types of financial support from drug companies in either research funding or speaking fees.  This does not mean the data are tainted, but it does mean the data require close scrutiny.  Neither the data nor conclusions in this study seem to suffer from undue influence, as far as I can tell from my reading. There is always the possibility of outright fraud, something that would be hard to detect in reading a study, but I see no reason to suspect this.  Also, their data and conclusions track very closely with what we know from previous studies on vaccination and neurologic problems.The second question likely to be raised is whether this study captured the correct populations.  The data make clear that when the recommended vaccination schedule is followed in the first year of life, there are no significant neurological sequelae in later childhood.  But the study did not specifically look at &amp;quot;alternative vaccine schedules&amp;quot; such as those proposed by alternative doctors.  It also did not specifically look at vaccination outside the first year of life.  It did however divide the children into &amp;quot;most timely&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;least timely&amp;quot; groups too look for effects that might be missed in aggregate.This is a strong study.  It seems likely that if vaccines given according to the recommended schedule during infancy were to lead to autism or other severe neurologic disorders, this study would have found an effect.  Since autism usually manifests by age 2, it is unlikely that an exposure in the second or third year of life would contribute significantly to the development of autism.  There is no such thing as &amp;quot;too many too soon&amp;quot;; it is simply another evidence-free attack on one of our safest and most effective public health measures.

have forced the medical and scientific community to waste valuable resources studying the same questions again and again.  And when the question is answered, the infectious disease promoters yank up the goalposts and start running.  There is no data set that will ever convince Jay Gordon, Jenny McCarthy, or Bob Sears that current vaccine recommendations are safe and effective.  There is also no external evidence that will cause them to alter their own recommendations for &amp;quot;alternative schedules&amp;quot;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But given the public health importance of vaccination, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; forced to counter the propaganda.  &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-2489v1"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Pediatrics &lt;/i&gt;does just that.  This study appears to have been designed to answer the questions frequently raised by antivaccine activists.  When thimerosal was proved to be innocuous they moved on to &amp;quot;toxins&amp;quot;.  When this gambit failed, they moved on to &lt;a href="http://www.talkaboutcuringautism.org/jenny/dc-rally/green-our-vaccines-rally.htm"&gt;"too many too soon".&lt;/a&gt; As this argument has unraveled, they have called for &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=939"&gt;"vaccinated vs. unvaccinated"&lt;/a&gt; studies, prospective studies which follow children who are and are not vaccinated and look at different rates of autism.  Epidemiologists have been all over the question of causation, but not surprisingly, the antivax crowd hasn&amp;#39;t been satisfied with them to date.  The new study adds another layer of evidence to what we already know: vaccines do not cause autism.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this study goes one step further and asks the question, &amp;quot;is it really &amp;#39;too many too soon?&amp;#39;&amp;quot; The study&amp;#39;s conclusion is in its title: &amp;quot;On-time Vaccine Receipt in the First Year Does Not Adversely Affect Neuropsychological Outcomes.&amp;quot;  The authors used vaccine data from several thousand children.  They compared children who followed the recommended vaccination schedule in the first year of life vs. those who did not, and compared neurological outcomes 7-10 years later.  The data were unequivocal: there were no significant neurologic problems present in the &amp;quot;off-schedule&amp;quot; group compared to the on-time group.  This very strongly argues against &amp;quot;too many too soon&amp;quot;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two rational complaints likely to be raised by the antivaccination crowd.  One is potential conflicts of interests in the authors.  Both authors have disclosed various types of financial support from drug companies in either research funding or speaking fees.  This does not mean the data are tainted, but it does mean the data require close scrutiny.  Neither the data nor conclusions in this study seem to suffer from undue influence, as far as I can tell from my reading. There is always the possibility of outright fraud, something that would be hard to detect in reading a study, but I see no reason to suspect this.  Also, their data and conclusions track very closely with what we know from previous studies on vaccination and neurologic problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second question likely to be raised is whether this study captured the correct populations.  The data make clear that when the recommended vaccination schedule is followed in the first year of life, there are no significant neurological sequelae in later childhood.  But the study did not specifically look at &amp;quot;alternative vaccine schedules&amp;quot; such as those proposed by alternative doctors.  It also did not specifically look at vaccination outside the first year of life.  It did however divide the children into &amp;quot;most timely&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;least timely&amp;quot; groups too look for effects that might be missed in aggregate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a strong study.  It seems likely that if vaccines given according to the recommended schedule during infancy were to lead to autism or other severe neurologic disorders, this study would have found an effect.  Since autism usually manifests by age 2, it is unlikely that an exposure in the second or third year of life would contribute significantly to the development of autism.  There is no such thing as &amp;quot;too many too soon&amp;quot;; it is simply another evidence-free attack on one of our safest and most effective public health measures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Pediatrics&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3A%2F10.1542%2Fpeds.2009-2489&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=On-time+Vaccine+Receipt+in+the+First+Year+Does+Not+Adversely+Affect+Neuropsychological+Outcomes&amp;amp;rft.issn=0031-4005&amp;amp;rft.date=2010&amp;amp;rft.volume=125&amp;amp;rft.issue=6&amp;amp;rft.spage=1134&amp;amp;rft.epage=1141&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Michael+J.+Smith&amp;amp;rft.au=Charles+R.+Woods&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Health"&gt;Michael J.

Here are the listed ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornea (pair): $30,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney: $62,000-$65,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver: $98,000-$130,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart: $130,000-$160,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreas: $150,000-$170,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete Cadaver: $200,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your reaction to that may be “gross”. Or it may be shock at the price tags, or the fact that there even is a black market for organs. But if you’re an entrepreneur, your first thought, like mine, was “hey there’s an arbitrage opportunity there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole cadaver costs $200k. At the low end of the range, split up into the pieces Wired lists you’re looking at $470k. That’s a pretty big ROI for what can’t be more than a couple hours of work for a skilled butcher. Not to mention whatever the unlisted organs fetch. Throw in the extra 100 pounds of bologna you’re left with after that, and you might be talking 3x your money.&lt;/p&gt;

As both a customer and shareholder of Palm, I’m happy with this.  It was, quite probably, Palm’s least bad option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a Pre for almost a year now, and while I love it, and truly think WebOS is by far the best mobile OS on the market, I can see why Palm has had trouble with it. Their advertising strategy has been pretty awful, to put it mildly. They’ve taken some steps to change that recently, and I think their newer ads will work out much better, but it’s unclear if they could sustain themselves long enough for that to happen if they had remained independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve also got to make some more appealing hardware. The Pre looks cheap and plasticy, and to some small extent feels that way too. HP might not be Apple, but they’re much better at building attractive hardware (when they try, which they often don’t) than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm made a seemingly enormous mistake in launching with Sprint. Their hardware had a pretty long technological lead on everyone else when it launched, but was about average by the time it got to the bigger carriers. Whatever Sprint gave them (in excess of what Verizon would have) it wasn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP is getting a lot in this deal. They’re getting the most user- and developer-friendly mobile OS on the market. They’re getting the carrier relationships (biz-dev is the name of the game in the mobile space) and clearly some engineering talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I’m afraid they may be developing the “man with a hammer syndrome” if all of the stories about &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/hp-slate/"&gt;killing off the Windows 7 Slate&lt;/a&gt; are true.  While I love my Pre, I have no desire for a bigger, faster one. There’s just too much it can’t do, even at 3x the size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d probably preorder a Windows 7 one. There’s just so much I can do on Windows 7, even on a device designed solely for casual use, that I cannot on an iPad or a comparable WebOS device. I can watch Hulu or play games. I can use Roboform to log into my zillions of web services without having to type passwords (and typing is the Achilles heel of virtual keypad devices, so anything that reduces it is going to be a big usability boon). I can use full-fledged Outlook or Trillian. I can use Dropbox and Windows Live Writer and VLC and uTorrent and play Chess on Yahoo. I can play Starcraft 2… ok maybe not. But you get the point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of things I can do on a full Windows machine dwarfs even the iTunes App Store, which itself makes the WebOS one look flabby and weak. I don’t want an app store, I want good old fashioned programs. Apps suck, they just suck a little less than websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want or need a bigger, less convenient version of my phone, I want a smaller, more convenient version of my laptop.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dot Net? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did that happen?  Presumably because &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.com"&gt;richarddawkins.com&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2010/05/24/atheist-richard-dawkins-wins-domain-name-case/"&gt;taken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The owner of RichardDawkins.com claimed that he was using the domain name merely as a fan site for Dawkins. There were affiliate links on the web site that linked to various products related to Dawkins, but the owner claimed that those links were there in exchange for free web hosting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit for the owner was that links to Dawkins’ books went to Amazon and he would get a cut of the profits, basically benefitting off of Dawkins’ name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, however, it was announced that &lt;a href="http://www.udrpsearch.com/naf/1317157"&gt;Dawkins would get that URL transferred to him&lt;/a&gt;, where it belongs.  A three-judge panel at the National Arbitration Forum said he was the &lt;a href="http://domainnamewire.com/2010/05/24/atheist-richard-dawkins-wins-domain-name-case/"&gt;rightful owner&lt;/a&gt; of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Panel unanimously finds that Richard Dawkins has established a common law trademark in his name. The three Panel members agree that &lt;strong&gt;Mr. Dawkins has perhaps done the most thorough job in establishing the existence of the common law trademark in a personal name that any of the three panelists have seen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put as simply as possible, when any one of the three panelists hears the name “Richard Dawkins”, each thinks automatically of the books and articles written by Mr. Dawkins supporting evolution, opposing creationism, and defending or asserting atheism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for Dawkins and for his fans?  Probably not much.  My guess is that the Dot Com URL will soon direct people right back to the Dot Net website.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, good for Dawkins for getting that URL back.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For a galaxy, though, it's really not fair to ask which one's the fairest.  It's simply too subjective of a question.  But &lt;b&gt;size&lt;/b&gt;, now that's something we can measure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I ask you -- galaxies of the Universe -- to step forward and show yourselves!  Galaxy, galaxy on the wall, who's the &lt;i&gt;largest&lt;/i&gt; one of all?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/Andromeda.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/Andromeda-thumb-500x362-49738.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="Andromeda.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice try, Andromeda.  Our biggest sister, Andromeda, has about &lt;b&gt;400 billion stars&lt;/b&gt; that make her up.  That's about 50% more than our Milky Way has, and it makes Andromeda the largest galaxy in our local group.  Andromeda is about 2 million light years away from us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those are some small potatoes.  If we want to find a bigger galaxy, we need to look at a bigger group of galaxies.  Let's try out the closest cluster to us...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/virgo_dss_big.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/virgo_dss_big-thumb-500x500-49740.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="virgo_dss_big.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virgo cluster!  If we want the biggest one, we go straight to the heart of the cluster, which is where the giant elliptical galaxy -- M87 -- lives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let's take a look at M87!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/M87_jet.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/M87_jet-thumb-500x522-49742.jpg" width="500" height="522" alt="M87_jet.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55 million light years distant, M87 is the largest and brightest galaxy in the Virgo cluster, and is notable for the huge, 5000-light-year-long jet coming from the supermassive black hole living at its core!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This galaxy is tremendous in its physical size: about 500,000 light-years in radius.  As far as its massiveness, it's about 200 times as massive as the Milky Way, or about &lt;b&gt;50 trillion times&lt;/b&gt; as massive as our Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if we go to even bigger clusters than Virgo?  Some of them are like the Coma Cluster, below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/comaatlas.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/comaatlas-thumb-500x533-49744.jpg" width="500" height="533" alt="comaatlas.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cluster is larger than Virgo, but what about its largest galaxy?  Well, there are two giant elliptical galaxies close to its center, NGC 4889 and NGC 4874, easily visible in the above image.  But even combined, they only add up to &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994ApJ...435..162V"&gt;20 to 30 trillion times&lt;/a&gt; the mass of our Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are spectacular galaxy clusters like the Perseus Cluster, which I'll show you below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/PerseusCluster_041008_041214_2000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/PerseusCluster_041008_041214_2000-thumb-500x332-49746.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="PerseusCluster_041008_041214_2000.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if we look at the heart of the Perseus cluster, we find the galaxy Perseus A, also known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_A"&gt;NGC 1275&lt;/a&gt;.  This is one spectacular galaxy:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/774px-NGC_1275_Hubble.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/774px-NGC_1275_Hubble-thumb-500x387-49748.jpg" width="500" height="387" alt="774px-NGC_1275_Hubble.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There's a &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt; version of this, from Hubble, of course, available &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/NGC_1275_Hubble.jpg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a distance of 237 million light years, it's really quite far!  And while it is hugely bright in its X-ray emissions, it's only about 100,000 light years in radius; only about 3 times the size of our Milky Way!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So some of these galaxies at the hearts of clusters are supermassive, loaded up with the matter from trillions of Suns in them, but others are much more modest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/ngc1399-FornaxGalaxyCluster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/ngc1399-FornaxGalaxyCluster-thumb-500x500-49750.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="ngc1399-FornaxGalaxyCluster.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we go around, finding galaxy clusters, and look for giant, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-cD_galaxy"&gt;centrally-dominant&lt;/a&gt; elliptical galaxies in them.  (Fornax, dominated by NGC 1399, is shown above.)  And we measure their angular size, their light, and try to infer their masses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So enough with the suspense, already!  &lt;b&gt;Who wins?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/Abell2029.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/Abell2029-thumb-500x375-49752.gif" width="500" height="375" alt="Abell2029.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say hello to cluster Abell 2029, a supercluster of galaxies just over a &lt;b&gt;billion light years&lt;/b&gt; away.  If we look at the heart of Abell 2029, we find the largest, most monstrous galaxy ever observed, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_1101"&gt;IC 1101&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/IC_1101_dss2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall/IC_1101_dss2-thumb-500x500-49754.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="IC_1101_dss2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IC 1101 is &lt;b&gt;5 to 6 million light years across&lt;/b&gt;, or about 5 times larger &lt;i&gt;in radius&lt;/i&gt; (and hence about 125 times larger in volume) than the huge M87!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates of its mass are close to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000,000,000"&gt;a quadrillion&lt;/a&gt; solar masses, with an estimated &lt;b&gt;100 trillion stars&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And -- as of right now -- it's the largest galaxy we know of in the entire Universe.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/galaxy_galaxy_on_the_wall.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274747454538"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/id_watch_it.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/39a4aa24cd365cb0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">I'd watch it</title><published>2010-05-25T01:07:47Z</published><updated>2010-05-25T01:07:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/1xLaSvqR9kQ/id_watch_it.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/id_watch_it.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's how I've always imagined Darwin's life, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s just disgorged two articles that criticize me for incivility and for not properly understanding the ways of God.  The first, &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-05-24-column24_ST_N.htm"&gt;“Atheists, it’s time to play well with others”&lt;/a&gt; (oy, what a title!), is at &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;.  The second, “&lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/jerry-coynes-insufferable-argument/"&gt;Jerry Coyne’s insufferable argument,”&lt;/a&gt; is at his own venue, &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt;.  I’ll take up the first one here, as I’m not sure I have the stomach for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s really nothing new in the &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; piece—it’s the wearying argument that even if the New Atheists are right, and there is no God, our tone is simply off-putting.  We’re shrill, obstreperous, and intolerant. &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; intolerant, in fact, than fundamentalists themselves, since a religously conservative seminary was open-minded enough to hire Bruce Waltke after Reformed Theological Seminary &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-04-09-IHE-evangelical-endorsing-evolution-forced-out09_ST_N.htm"&gt;forced him to resign&lt;/a&gt; for being soft on evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Giberson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science and faith are compatible because there are lots of religious scientists.  Some of them have even won Nobel Prizes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Hello? Anybody listening out there?  Earth to Giberson:  no New Atheist has ever denied that faith and science can be “compatible” in the sense that both can be simultaneously embraced by one human mind.  The argument is, and always has been, about whether science and faith are &lt;em&gt;philosophically&lt;/em&gt; compatible.  Do they clash because they deal with “data” in disparate ways? Do they have completely different standards for judging “truth”?  I say “yes,” and assert that religious scientists exist in a state of cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stated this perfectly clearly in an earlier &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/coyne09/coyne09_index.html"&gt;New Republic&lt;/a&gt; article that, apparently, helped inspire Giberson’s &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; piece. But this simple logic still eludes him.  Well, let me inform Dr. Giberson one last time what his argument implies: Catholicism is compatible with pedophilia because many Catholics are pedophiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atheist-scientists claim “that a fellow scientist doing world-class science must abandon his or her religion to be a good scientist.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; You know, Giberson is really starting to tick me off.  I have never said this, nor, to my knowledge, have any New Atheists.  All of us agree, for instance, that evangelical Christian Francis Collins is a good scientist.  What we say is that anybody doing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of science should abandon his or her faith if they wish become a &lt;em&gt;philosophically consistent&lt;/em&gt; scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to see Giberson as disingenuous when he continues to accuse New Atheists of things that they don’t believe, and which he &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; that they don’t believe.  That’s how creationists behave, for crying out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I attacked Giberson in an unseemly manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennett’s brother-in-arms, atheist Jerry Coyne, raked Brown University cell biologist Ken Miller and me over the coals in &lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt; for our claims that Christians can unapologetically embrace science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raked them over the coals?&lt;/em&gt; I defy anybody to read &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/3574"&gt;that article&lt;/a&gt; and say that it’s uncivil. In fact, it says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Giberson and Miller are thoughtful men of good will. Reading them, you get a sense of conviction and sincerity absent from the writings of many creationists, who blatantly deny the most obvious facts about nature in the cause of their faith. Both of their books are worth reading: Giberson for the history of the creation/ evolution debate, and Miller for his lucid arguments against intelligent design. Yet in the end they fail to achieve their longed-for union between faith and evolution. And they fail for the same reason that people always fail: a true harmony between science and religion requires either doing away with most people’s religion and replacing it with a watered-down deism, or polluting science with unnecessary, untestable, and unreasonable spiritual claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, that’s &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; harsh, dudes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t rake Miller and Giberson over the coals, I raked &lt;em&gt;their ideas&lt;/em&gt; over the coals.  Giberson, like Michael Ruse, can’t see the difference between attacking ideas and attacking persons. Which brings us to Giberson’s last complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticizing faith is “un-American.” &lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn’t have believe this McCarthy-esque accusation if I hadn’t seen it myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something profoundly un-American about demanding that people give up cherished, or even uncherished, beliefs just because they don’t comport with science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait. Isn’t  that &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what Giberson is doing when he tells people, as he did in his latest book, that they should stop espousing creationism because science disproves it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giberson is, &lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Archie Bunker, telling vociferous atheists to stifle themselves.  Criticizing religion is off limits because it clashes with people’s cherished—or uncherished!—beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;‘s what’s un-American: demanding special privileges for religion, and immunity from criticism, that other bodies of thought, like political views, don’t enjoy.  Giberson would never tell Democrats to stop criticizing Republicans’ cherished ideas of offshore drilling and racial profiling. Political ideas must survive the rough-and-tumble market of free thought.   Giving a pass to religious ideas, simply because they are religious, makes about as much sense as giving tax breaks to churches.  The First Amendment is there because free expression allows the best ideas to rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of speech is &lt;em&gt;profoundly&lt;/em&gt; American.   Like Dorothy, we atheists have looked behind the curtain of religious thought and found nothing there.  And we talk about that.  Is a little criticism, and, at times, ridicule, too much for Giberson to bear? Are he and his comrades in faith such wilting flowers that they must at all cost be protected from criticism of their supernaturalism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, Giberson condescendingly admonishes us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Atheists need to learn how to play in the sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, Dr. Giberson, no can do—not if “playing” means pretending to eat the invisible sandwiches that our playmates offer us. And besides, you know what happens when you put a kitteh in the sandbox:&lt;/p&gt;

Hanson&lt;/strong&gt; is an ex-Mormon and the author of the excellent blog &lt;a href="http://lfab-uvm.blogspot.com/2010/05/exmormons-real-launch.html"&gt;Letters From a Broad…&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her new book about growing up Mormon, &lt;em&gt;ExMormon&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439256403?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1439256403"&gt;finally available on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you’re raised Mormon, you have a plan all laid out for you: baptism at age eight, meetings every week, scouting and the priesthood (if you’re a boy), perhaps a mission and/or BYU, then temple marriage, kids of your own, and finally exaltation. But not everybody sticks to the script. Exmormon is a series of eight-and-a-half novellas about the kids of three Mormon families as they try to follow the straight-and-narrow path but occasionally strike out on their own. Their stories neither praise Mormonism nor condemn it. Growing up Mormon may or may not be a tragedy; losing your childhood belief may or may not be a failure — but either way, it’s an adventure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanson adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I’m planning to donate the proceeds to &lt;a href="http://solar-aid.org/"&gt;Solar Aid&lt;/a&gt; and/or to the local conservation partnership with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoala_National_Park"&gt;Masoala National Park&lt;/a&gt; in Madagascar.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re a couple great causes and it’s a fantastic story.  Congratulations to her for getting &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439256403?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1439256403"&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt; out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the sites you can visit to find out how many sex offenders live or work near you. It’s seen as a measure of public safety to keep the community informed of their whereabouts. It also may be another form of punishment for the offender; a reminder that they’ve lost all privacy. In England and Wales, there’s a movement to keep the identities of rapists anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition thinks the fact that the victim is unnamed, but the accused is identified, creates a double standard. Great Britain tried not naming accused sex offenders once before for 12 years, but the policy was eventually repealed because it was impeding police investigations; authorities wanted other victims who had been attacked by the accused to come forward, which victims can’t do unless the accused is named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that this may be different in cases where defendants are falsely accused, but it seems to us that while rape victims deserve to be protected from the resulting emotional trauma and potential stigma, rapists don’t deserve that same protection. The names of those who are accused of everything from petty crimes to murder are released to the public – rape shouldn’t be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think – should the names of accused sex offenders be public record? Let us know in the comments section, below.&lt;/p&gt;

They had landed on the edge of Antarctica five months earlier, hoping to be the first people in history to reach the South Pole. They succeeded in reaching the Pole, but it was a bitter success. They discovered that another team, led by Roald Amundsen, had gotten there first. So Scott and his team turned back and began the 800-mile journey back to the sea. They hauled sledges themselves, without the help of dogs. The plunging temperatures increased the friction of the snow, so that they had to put in as much effort as they would to haul the sledges through sand. On February 4, Edgar Evans dropped dead. On March 16, Laurence Oates, barely able to walk, simply left the camp and never came back. A blizzard on March 20 left them unable to leave their tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not think we can hope for any better things now,” Scott wrote in his diary nine days later. “We shall stick it out to the end, but we are getting weaker, of course, and the end cannot be far.” And indeed he likely died that day. Scott and his crew were finally discovered eight months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott may not have been the first person to reach the South Pole, but he did earn a different kind of distinction: “the greatest human performances of sustained physical endurance of all time,” &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/p7177367878330n1/"&gt;in the words&lt;/a&gt; of University of Cape Town sports scientist Timothy Noakes. All told, Scott probably burned about million calories. Each day he and his fellow explorers burned around 7,000 calories, about four times the rate of a man at rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott’s accomplishment was exceptional not just for a human, but for any animal. Animals rarely push their metabolism beyond about four times their resting rate for any length of time. A cheetah may explode into a sixty-mile-an-hour sprint, but for only a few seconds. Most animals that push themselves hard–birds racing around to find food for their chicks for days on end, for example–only push themselves about four times above their resting metabolic rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="godwit440" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/05/godwit440.jpg" alt="godwit440" width="440" height="235"&gt;In 2007, however, a small bird left Scott in the dust. Scientists discovered that bar-tailed godwits could fly from Alaska to New Zealand, non-stop. Their metabolism, scientists found, rose to about eight times their resting rate. And it stayed there, 24 hours a day, for nine days. And while Scott could refuel on his journey by eating horse meat and pemmican, the bar-tailed godwits fasted for their entire  7,000 miles journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I report in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25migrate.html"&gt;the lead story of the Science Times in tomorrow’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25migrate.html"&gt; New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, research now shows that the bar-tailed godwit has some company. Using sophisticated new location-tracking devices, scientists have discovered other species several travel several thousand miles without a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also write about the deeper significance of these new results. How do these birds achieve these awesome treks. And why? In &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000362"&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt;, the Swedish biologist Anders Hederstrom argues that birds like bar-tailed godwits aren’t all that unusual. Lots of birds that go on much shorter migrations have many of the same adaptations as the champions–the ability to store up fat, an ability to navigate long distances, an efficient body shape, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nioz.nl/nioz_nl/e031f05da0bdac4074029c08a0c2b649.php"&gt;Theunis Piersma&lt;/a&gt;, a Dutch biologist, offered up a provocative idea for the evolution of ultramarathoning birds. Their migrations may be able to shift quickly from short to long. Birds have a huge potential to work hard, without the need for long-term physical evolutionary changes coming first. All they need is a change in behavior, and their bodies will meet the challenge. Once they shift their behavior, natural selection may well favor physical changes that help them go long distances. (Piersma will write about this at length in his upcoming book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199233721?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199233721"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flexible Phenotype&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Piersma, what’s really interesting is why godwits and some other birds push so hard, while most other animals don’t. Piersma thinks that laziness is, for the most part, adaptive. If animals push themselves beyond about four times their resting metabolic rate, they usually have to pay dearly. They become vulnerable to predators and disease, for example. When scientists have added extra chicks to the nests of kestrel hawks, for example, the parents have to work harder to feed them. As a result, the scientists found, the parents became more likely to die. When scientists add little weights to bees that are buzzing around gathering nectar, the bees are also more likely to die. And Scott himself is a grisly illustration of Piersma’s tradeoff.  His foot became infected so badly, he wrote, that “amputation is the best I can hope for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying over open seas, however, may allow some birds to escape this trade-off. Predators and parasites can’t catch them when they’re hundreds of miles from the nearest land. When bar-tailed godwits land after flying 7,000 miles, they can just take a long nap without worrying about being eaten. The very things that might make exhaustion more dangerous are missing from their migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Question:&lt;/strong&gt; It is more dangerous to carry weight on your body in certain places than others? A build-up of fat in one particular part of your body will make you more likely to develop health problems. Which part of your body is the riskiest place to have a build-up of fat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer to our &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/smoking-and-birth-control-daily-health-quiz/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last health quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: We’ve heard that those who take birth control aren’t supposed to smoke, but is there actually a risk? According to &lt;em&gt;Our Bodies, Ourselves&lt;/em&gt;, women who take birth control and smoke have a significantly higher risk of having a heart attack and a stroke than women who do not do either activity. If you need more motivation to quit, check out all the &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/feel/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-stop-smoking-right-now/"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; you’ll enjoy by not being a smoker.&lt;/p&gt;

A study by Canada’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) has confirmed earlier findings that chronic users of ecstasy (MDMA) have abnormally low levels of serotonin transporter molecules in the cerebral cortex. 

While a decade of research on the effects of ecstasy on brain serotonin has been controversial and largely inconclusive, the latest study used drug hair analysis to confirm levels of MDMA in 49 users and 50 controls. An additional division was made between chronic X users who also tested positive for methamphetamine, and those who did not. Regular usage of MDMA was defined as two tablets twice a month. 

The Canadian study, funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and published in the journal Brain, suggests that the serotonin surge responsible for ecstasy’s effects results in a net depletion in regular X users. That is not a new finding--but the Canadian study goes further, suggesting that the serotonin depletion is localized in one area of the brain.

“We were surprised to discover that SERT was decreased only in the cerebral cortex and not throughout the brain,” said study leader Stephen Kish in a press release, “perhaps because serotonin nerves to the cortex are longer and more susceptible to changes.”

Low SERT levels in the cerebral cortex were found in all X users, with or without amphetamine. Dr. Kish noted that the CAMH findings replicate what Kish referred to as “newer data” from Johns Hopkins University.  In 1999, a controversial serotonin study of ecstasy users at Johns Hopkins laboratory was criticized for overestimating the level of danger posed by ecstasy-induced serotonin impairments. 

Okay, the finding is becoming more robust. But what does it mean? According to co-author Isabelle Boileau, a low SERT level does “not necessarily” indicate structural brain damage. “There is no way to prove whether low SERT is explained by physical loss of the entire serotonin nerve cell, or by a loss of SERT protein within an intact nerve cell.” 

For his part, Dr. Kish indicated that his concerns centered on the connection between lower serotonin measurements and MDMA tolerance levels. “Most of the ecstasy users of our study complained that the first dose is always the best, but then the effects begin to decline and higher doses are needed,” he said. “The need for higher doses, possibly caused by low SERT, could well increase the risk of harm caused by this stimulant drug.”  The published study concluded that “behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions.”

However, in addition to the confounding variable of methamphetamine (see my post, “How Pure is Ecstasy?”), it remains unclear whether the SERT alterations detected in the study are transient or permanent. Moreover, the nature of the link that “might” exist between lower SERT levels and cognitive impairment in the brains of regular ecstasy users remains a subject of dispute in the drug research community, as in this earlier post.  (And just to emphasize that drugs are complicated things, a spate of promising recent research has suggested that ecstasy might be an effective option for treating people with post-traumatic stress disorder).

The CAMH, affiliated with the University of Toronto, is Canada’s largest mental health and addiction teaching hospital.

Our mutual Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™ introduced us, of all things. He runs a site called &lt;a href="http://www.asitecalledfred.com/2010/05/23/phil-plait-ken-plume-chat/"&gt;ASiteCalledFred&lt;/a&gt; and has lots of podcast interviews with interesting people, and he decided to break that streak and talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His chats are pretty free-form; he asks questions but lets things go where they may. He learned a lesson with me, no doubt. He let me ramble about The Monkees, my daughter’s first word, NASA, constellations, NASA, and I think NASA. We really did bop around from topic to topic, making it a Faulkneresque rapids ride of skepticism and science and some mild stabs at humor (on my part).

Here's an excerpt from the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April and May of 2010 I visited nine sacrificial sites in Uppland and Södermanland provinces, selecting them by the criteria that I had to be able to ascertain their locations closely, the finds should preferably be rather rich, and I favoured sites located within walking distance of each other. The winter had been long and cold, and so vegetation was still sparse and much plough soil remained open to field walking. This ensured the best possible conditions for observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people under study here primarily sought out wet sites for their sacrifices. The hilltop deposits in Vårdinge are particularly eloquent: they were put in high places, but in &lt;i&gt;bogs&lt;/i&gt; up there. Yet as the title of this paper suggests [Gods of High Places and Deep Romantic Chasms], it also emerges that Bronze Age people had a strong predilection for landscape locations that a modern visitor would find dramatic or even sublime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their-pre-regulation states, the river-gorge sites of Hyndevadsfallet and Täckhammarsbro would have called to mind Coleridge's deep romantic chasm [An excerpt from "Kubla Khan" is the paper's motto]. Each is at the narrowest point downstream from a major lake system. And they were deep as measured in time as well. Sacrifices had begun there in the Middle or Late Neolithic, and at Hyndevadsfallet they continued up into the 17th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pukberget cave deposit is to my knowledge unique, being inside a jumble of enormous stone blocks from a collapsed cliff side. A more sublime location is hard to come by: the site's name means "Devil's Hill", and it has probably born it since the Middle Ages. A similar association between spearheads and the innards of mountains can be seen in a find from a crevice on Oxeberget Hill near Frändesta in Helgesta, Södermanland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there is also a major find from a dry apparently domestic site: Lilla Härnevi. When interpreting the Härnevi deposit's landscape location, however, we must keep in mind that it is extremely late in the Bronze Age and may even have been buried in the first century of the Iron Age. If the many settlement-indicating burnt mounds of Lilla Härnevi hamlet were heaped while the area was shore-bound, then they are about a thousand years older than the deposit. The burnt mounds are still visually prominent today, the plough soil around the hamlet full of fire-cracked stone and quartz. It looks as if people returned to the ruins of a storied ancient settlement site and buried their last multi-period collection of mixed bronzes there, right about the time when society left the Bronze Age behind and moved on. The Hjortsberga torque deposit, while also quite near burnt mounds, has a different relationship to the settlement site, being above and beyond the shore zone where the burnt mounds and graves are. I discovered a cupmark boulder among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sites discussed above demonstrate the attractiveness of wet, high, topographically dramatic and ancestral locations to Bronze Age sacrifices. Let me finally point out another class of sacrificial site that, like the wet locations, is also well known from other periods than the Bronze Age. To my knowledge, at least five dry deposits from Uppland and Södermanland were found under or in contact with eye-catching boulders. Four of them are multi-object deposits, including the great hoard from near Spelvik church in Södermanland, and these are rare. It has been argued, irrefutably, that such a location with a prominent and durable marker would make it easy to retrieve the objects. Yet the fact remains that these deposits were never retrieved. This leads us to the perennial question of whether we need to distinguish between rationally motivated temporary and cultic permanent metalwork deposition.&lt;/p&gt;

Lambertz et al. at the National Food Administration in Finland describe a sensitive and specific real-time PCR assay to detect the food-borne pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Traditional culture-based methods are limited by the low isolation rate of this Gram-negative bacterium in naturally contaminated samples.  Using the MasterPure™ Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit, the researchers isolated DNA from 25 food samples including mixed salad, minced meat, nonpasteurized milk, carrots, turnips, cabbage, lettuce, onion, pumpkin, and tomatoes. They developed TaqMan® qPCR assays using gene-specific probes to detect the Y. pseudotuberculosis ail gene, and distinguish it from related Y. enterocolitica serotypes. Whereas 6 of the analyzed food samples were positive for Y. pseudotuberculosis as indicated by PCR, all 25 were negative when analyzed by the traditional culture method.Lambertz, S. et al. (2008).

			&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a very bad day for Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced UK gastroenterologist famous for birthing the latest wave of vaccine rejectionism. First, the General Medical Council stripped Wakefield of his license to practice medicine. Then, in an ill-advised effort to salvage his public image, Wakefield sat down for an interview with an irritable Matt Lauer on &lt;em&gt;The Today Show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this the final blow to your credibility?” asked Lauer, checking off a partial list of blows: the multiple studies that disprove Wakefield’s fraudulent 1998 study, &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; retraction, and the twin losses of job and medical license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is that it?” asked Lauer again, like he needed permission to stop booking this guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield was ready with two old, discredited talking points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings that we made originally have been replicated in five different countries of the world, so the bowel disease in these children exists,” said Wakefield. &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/04/does-autistic-enterocolitis-exist/"&gt;He’s talking about&lt;/a&gt; an unpublished abstract of a five-year-old meeting; two case studies of GI disease in one and two autistic adults, respectively; a Venezuelan study that specifically failed to support Wakefield’s hypothesis; and a “study” in a journal that Wakefield himself edits. Lauer, still unclear whether it’s OK to ignore Wakefield, tried to move one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield, speaking over Lauer as he tried to ask another question, said that the US government has been “secretly” conceding a link between vaccines and autism since 1991. As Sullivan at LBRB &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/andrew-wakefield-on-the-today-show/"&gt;points out today,&lt;/a&gt; this “bombshell” was first dropped by anti-vaccine publicist David Kirby last summer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, more than 1,300 vaccine court cases were already paid out for  encephalopathy and seizure disorders. We will soon learn how many of  those children also have an ASD, though I can  confirm now that it appears to be far, far higher than the1-in-150 rate  reported by CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Kirby never followed up, and for good reason. In March, 2008, Kathleen Seidel performed a simple search of Vaccine Injury Compensation Program court records &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/148/"&gt;and found nine such cases&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Published VICP decisions include at least  nine instances in which compensation was awarded for the lifelong care  of children and young adults who were diagnosed with autism or related  conditions after they sustained documented, verifiable vaccine injuries.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That’s nine cases out of 2,100 where compensation was awarded, for a rate of 1:233. Even if we double the number of cases of autism, the overall rate is still less than the latest CDC prevalence of 1:100. In other words, the rate of autism among compensable VICP cases is no higher than what is expected in the population at large.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So to recap:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it OK for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the news and entertainment media to ignore Wakefield?&lt;/em&gt; No, according to Wakefield. Lauer is still on the fence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is Wakefield still credible?&lt;/em&gt; Because five studies that aren’t really studies, including one that disagrees with Wakefield, and one unpublished meeting abstract, support what Wakefield says, even though every bona fide researcher in the world disagrees.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anything else?&lt;/em&gt; An anti-vaccine publicist wrote one year ago that the US government has been conceding a causal relationship between vaccines and autism, but there is no evidence for such a claim, and the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm"&gt;vaccine court’s own website&lt;/a&gt; says that no instance of vaccine-induced autism has ever been compensated.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is that it?&lt;/em&gt; Not if you ignore the internationally-publicized &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/us-court-of-appeals-denies-vaccine-court-case/"&gt;decision by US vaccine court&lt;/a&gt; where three judges found no association between vaccines and autism.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield was right on one important point: we haven’t heard the last of him. As long as news outlets &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/93209399.html"&gt;book first and ask questions later&lt;/a&gt;, the public will be exposed to all manner of pseudoscience and medical quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

It was designed to investigate the history of water on Mars, digging into the surface soil and examining the chemistry there. It had a limited design lifetime of only a few months, since the onset of Martian winter in the north made weather conditions too severe to continue operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope was that NASA would be able to revive the lander once spring had sprung. Many such attempts have failed, and we may now know why: &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-175"&gt;new images show the lander may be damaged&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA13158.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/phoenix_damage.jpg" alt="phoenix_damage" title="phoenix_damage" width="610" height="334"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image on the left was taken in July 2008 with the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and shows the lander in blue. The image on the right was taken just a few days ago, on May 7, 2010. The illumination is similar in the two shots — note the landscapes are very similar looking — but the shadow cast by the lander looks different now. My first thought was that dust built up on the lander, making it look different, but scientists have shown this not to be the case.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
More likely, carbon dioxide buildup on the solar panels bent or even broke one of the panels. There were predictions that this might happen, so while this isn’t a total surprise, it’s disappointing. This means that Phoenix will not be able to soak up enough solar energy to restart its operations, which in turn, sadly, means it really is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is it did a tremendous job in its mission, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html"&gt;returning important data about the properties of the Martian surface&lt;/a&gt;. Although it appears the mission is now over, it was a raging success and I’m happy for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funny: Mars missions tend to fail catastrophically before they even get there, or they get to Mars and seem to last forever. Spirit and Opportunity have long outlasted their warranties, and we have several orbiters still going strong. And even though Phoenix made it down to the surface and exceeded its planned lifetime, it’s still a little weird to find out it’s dead. It shows me that we get used to ESA, NASA, and JPL’s superhuman efforts when it comes to their missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space exploration is hard, damn hard. But we continue to do it, &lt;em&gt;and we continue to get better at it&lt;/em&gt;. So while this specific news is disappointing, it’s also a reminder that we can’t take anything for granted. My hat’s off to the scientists and engineers who made Phoenix work, and work beyond expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

Andrew Wakefield, who touched off an international controversy by claiming a possible link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism, has lost his medical license, but says he will continue to fight to prove his case. Do you think vaccines are related to autism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;39.4%
Yes. So many more cases, so many more vaccinations - it can't just be coincidence.
&lt;br&gt;
55.4%
No. There is no scientific evidence the two things are related.
&lt;br&gt;
5.2%
I'm not sure. There needs to be more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/autism-vaccination_poll_needs.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pD9dn8R8EO8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274731276036"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebd426864f3286e3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">For Those Who Have Inquired...</title><published>2010-05-24T18:16:12Z</published><updated>2010-05-24T18:16:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/3-newsflash/996-for-those-who-have-inquired.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Martin Gardner’s wishes – clearly expressed in his will – called for his immediate cremation and for no funeral service, a request to which his son James has of course acceded.

When we wed and for most of our married life, we were both atheists. Open, honest communication and shared beliefs were the cornerstone of our relationship. Last year he told me he had decided to become a Catholic. It turns out he started believing in a god about three years ago, and hid it from me till he determined that he really wanted to pursue religion. I found stashes of Christian books hidden in our home and he finally came clean that he’d even been lying to me about where he was so he could go to church without my knowledge. Please do not delete my email because as ridiculous as it sounds, this is pathetically true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was raised in a Christian family by a man who used religion as justification for physical, emotional and sexual abuse. I cannot abide the thought of being married to or raising my daughters with a Christian. Following my husband’s disclosure to me, I sank into a deep depression and started having nightmares and flashbacks. We separated for several months and went to couples therapy. I am on meds for depression and he has decided not to become anything specific, but still wants to pursue spirituality, whatever that means. It’s been almost a year and we are doing alright but I find I respect and trust him so much less. I would love to know your thoughts.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you!&lt;br&gt;
one sad mama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. His mother is a recent Jewish convert and is thrilled that he is “exploring the spiritual side of himself.”  His father is Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. Since my husband is very well read and was atheist for decades, he knows all the arguments against religion I might make. Our book shelves are full of scientific and rational thinkers but he has turned away from reason saying he needs something more. He thinks C.S. Lewis and others have made the case for god. I’m really desperate here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear one sad mama,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hold a very precious thing in your hands. Don’t let pain from your past cause you pain in the future by tossing away that treasure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first paragraph is simply a role reversal of many letters I get where a couple is in crisis because they married as believers and some time later one of them became an atheist.  The theist spouse feels betrayed and suddenly begins treating the atheist as if he has become a dangerous intruder, even though he has done nothing to deserve it.  He feels unfairly judged and condemned despite his continued love and loyalty. It makes no sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it makes no sense to throw away a loving relationship only because your partner stops believing in gods, then it makes no sense to throw it away only because he starts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are what we do, not what we think.  We think thousands of thoughts per hour, but we are defined by our persistent behaviors, by our conduct. What makes us real is how we live. Your husband secretly read some books and attended church. But consider the sum total of your husband’s behaviors. Has he radically changed his behaviors as a husband and father? Have his &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; suddenly become unloving and unsupportive? Or is he, by the broad scope of  how he lives, still the man you married?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If his general conduct has not changed, then you are upset only about some thoughts going on in his head. Out of the 100 billion neurons in his brain, at the most only a few million neurons are involved with his religious thoughts.  Those cells weigh but a few grams. Such a trifle should not ruin so strong and well established a marriage as the one you have described. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the second paragraph of your letter complicates things.  Where there is old pain there can be fresh fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad that you both went to couples therapy, and that you’re “doing alright,” but you both deserve better than alright. I hope that you went long enough to learn how to improve the impaired areas of your communications, and how to work out agreements.  If not, go back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You said “Open, honest communication and shared beliefs were the cornerstone of our relationship.” Open, honest communication is definitely essential for a marriage, but shared beliefs are not necessarily as important, if by “shared” you mean they must &lt;em&gt;match.&lt;/em&gt; It looks like the expectation that the two of you would always have matching beliefs interfered with the ability to be open and honest. Apparently your husband did not feel safe to “share,” meaning to tell you about his changing beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where it is very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important to avoid seeking who is to “blame” for that lack of openness and that lack of feeling safe. Blaming will solve nothing and will only deepen the rift.  Don’t fix the blame, fix the problem. Rather than one or both taking blame, both of you can take responsibility. That word means &lt;em&gt;ability to respond.&lt;/em&gt; Both of you can respond to the problem of a constricted part of your communication, and together you can make it safe and open, even about beliefs that don’t match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also glad that you sought help for your depression, and I hope that the medication helps. However, depressed or not, the childhood trauma that you suffered at the hands of the man who raised you is intruding into your present relationship and is poisoning it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You said, “I cannot abide the thought of being married to or raising my daughters with a Christian.” I think you cannot abide the thought of being with the man who raised and abused you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your husband is not that man.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That man is defined by his actions, and so is your husband. By their actions they are utterly different men. The only similarity between them is the small part of their Christian beliefs that might overlap.  If your husband was anything like that man &lt;em&gt;in how he lives,&lt;/em&gt; you would have left him years ago, long before he became interested in Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that you can recognize the unfairness and irrationality of punishing someone through guilt by association just because the name of his beliefs reminds you of an abusive parent.  But recognizing where you are being unfair and irrational will not automatically make you become fair and rational if you are being driven by unhealed injury and unsoothed pain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You did not mention getting any counseling therapy for yourself to resolve and recover from the physical, emotional and sexual abuse. The medication may help with your depression, but until you are free from the ghosts of your past, you will react with fear and loathing to anyone who inadvertently triggers memories and associations by any similarity at all to the abuser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your husband has stayed with you for many years through your mutual joys and sorrows, your easy times and tough times. These last three years cannot have been easy for him either, yet he is still there with you.  Together, you have built a treasure. If you let the sick, twisted man who abused you as a child reach out from the past to destroy this precious thing you hold in your hands, then you’re letting him abuse you once again.  Don’t let him win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get expert help about your childhood abuse, work on it diligently, gradually put it to rest, and finally be free of the past.  Work positively and blamelessly with your husband to make sure that both of you feel safe to be fully open and honest, and nobody has to keep any secrets. Clearly, you are both very intelligent people.  You can work out mutually acceptable agreements as he explores this part of himself. Wherever your not-so-perfectly matching beliefs might cause you to pull in different directions, for instance things involving your children, you can  find creative solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this. It is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, it has some issues, but in general we can make some broad statements about it: the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction,  for one thing, and they also orbit pretty much in the same plane. If you look at the system from the side, the orbits would all look flat, like a DVD seen from the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s left over from the formation of the solar system itself, which happened when a cloud of dust and gas collapsed into a disk. The planets formed from that disk, so they all orbit in roughly the same plane. We see other systems forming in the same way, so we assume that when we look at those planets, they’ll also have all their planets in a plane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops. Maybe not so much. &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/17"&gt;Astronomers have just announced&lt;/a&gt; that they’ve confirmed a system where the planets are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; all aligned this way, and in fact the planets are titled relative to each other by as much as 30°!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2010/17/image/a/format/web_print/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/hst_upsand.jpg" alt="hst_upsand" title="hst_upsand" width="610" height="558"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the parent star is Upsilon Andromedae — that made me chuckle, because &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon_Andromedae"&gt;it was one of the very first stars found to have planets orbiting it&lt;/a&gt;, back in 1996. It’s actually a binary star, two stars orbiting each other; one is a star slightly more massive and hotter than the Sun, and the other a dinky red dwarf orbiting pretty far out (well outside the frame of that illustration of the system above). Three planets (called Upsilon Andromedae b, c, and d) at least are known to orbit the primary star. The planets were initially detected by their gravitational pull on the star; as they orbit they move the star in a mutual tug-of-war. We can’t (usually) see that motion directly, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/29/a-tiny-wobble-reveals-a-massive-planet/"&gt;but it can be detected as a Doppler shift in the star’s light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the physics of the situation, that method only gives us a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; mass for a planet. The actual mass might be much higher. It also doesn’t tell us the tilt of the orbit of the planet, or of any of the other planets in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2010-17-b-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/hst_upsand2.jpg" alt="hst_upsand2" title="hst_upsand2" width="300" height="293"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/news/releases/2010/0524.html"&gt;What’s new here&lt;/a&gt; is that astronomers used telescopes on Hubble called the Fine Guidance Sensors, which are incredibly accurate and highly precise. The FGSs are so accurate that they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; see the physical motion of the star on the sky, the wobbling as the planets tugged on it this way and that. Think of it like a harried parent at a mall with two little kids holding her hand. As the kids see one store or another they want to visit, they pull on her in different directions as she walks with them, so her path down the mall corridor shifts left and right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the new Hubble data with the older Doppler data has revealed a wealth of information about the planets in that system. For one thing, it nailed the masses. Instead of lower limits, we now have accurate masses for planets: Ups And c is 14 times the mass of Jupiter, and Ups And d is 10 times Jupiter’s mass&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Mind you, Jupiter is a bit of a bruiser, so these are hefty planets. These masses are far larger than thought before, so the new observations really changed our thinking here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the amazing thing is that it looks like Ups And c and d are in &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; different orbits: instead of being almost exactly in the same plane as expected, they are tilted relative to one another by 30°! The illustration on the right compared those orbits with those of planets in our own solar system, and you can see how weird this is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does this mean astronomers are wrong about how planets form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. We’re pretty sure we understand how planets form, at least in general terms. What this &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; mean is that something happened to the planets &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they formed, something that tossed one or both of these planets into different orbits than the ones they were born in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; surprise. Pluto may or may not be a planet by your definition, but it orbits the Sun at an angle of 17° with respect to the Earth. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna"&gt;Sedna&lt;/a&gt;, an object about the same size as Pluto in the outer solar system, also has a large tilt. We know there is some mechanism that can change the orbits of big objects in the solar system, so why not in other systems, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Upsilon Andromedae, we have some culprits. The data hint that there may be a fourth planet orbiting the star. It’s not clear if it’s there or not, but if it has an elliptical orbit it could gravitationally affect the inner planets. There’s also the red dwarf star orbiting farther out. Far more massive than a planet, its gravity may have some effect on the system as well. It’s also certainly possible that there are other influences we haven’t seen or thought of yet. &lt;em&gt;[Update: I just got off the phone with the team who did this research, and Rory Barnes told me that a strong possibility as well is that there were more planets in the system initially. They would have interacted via gravity, and affected each others' orbits. A likely scenario is that a planet with about ten times the mass of Jupiter could have messed up the orbits of the other two, then been ejected out of the system. This is a common outcome when you have lots of massive objects in one system.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that in general, our theories of how planets form is pretty good. As we study more of these systems, we’ll get more and more data under our belts that will help us catalog and understand where these systems follow our theories, and where they seem to diverge. That’s all good news! Theories only go so far in explaining everything, and as we observe more we modify those ideas, add to them, so they better represent the Universe around us. That’s how science works, and that’s how we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Unfortunately, Ups And b orbits too close to its parent star to get an accurate mass for it. That’ll have to wait for the future, with new techniques and better instruments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/Andrew_Wakefield.jpg" alt="Andrew_Wakefield" title="Andrew_Wakefield" width="144" height="180"&gt;Andrew Wakefield, the man who more than anyone started the modern antivaccination movement that has led to the rise of measles, pertussis, and other preventable diseases, &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/05/24/statement-from-gmc-regarding-wakefield/"&gt;has been struck off the UK General Medical Council’s register&lt;/a&gt;. The GMC registers doctors in the UK, and oversees their conduct. To be struck off is essentially the same as being disbarred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is indeed good news, but forgive me if I don’t dance in the streets. It hardly makes any difference, and is years too late.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/wakefield.html"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; published a paper which led to people thinking vaccines caused autism. His research was shoddy, poorly done, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/28/antivaxxer-movement-leader-found-to-have-acted-unethically/"&gt;unethical&lt;/a&gt;, and, frankly, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/01/06/abc-news-embraces-the-nonsense/"&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/02/and-now-the-antivax-failure-is-complete-the-lancet-withdraws-wakefields-paper/"&gt;the original paper was withdrawn&lt;/a&gt; by the medical journal in which it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/syringe.jpg" alt="Syringe, from http://www.flickr.com/photos/8499561@N02/2756332192/" title="Syringe, from http://www.flickr.com/photos/8499561@N02/2756332192/" width="250" height="188"&gt;That’s all great, in that eventually truth won out. But has it, really? Sure, he’s disbarred, and reality-based people understand he’s totally wrong. But &lt;a href="http://www.antivaxxers.com/"&gt;the antivax movement&lt;/a&gt; still rolls on. Wakefield &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5728998.ece"&gt;moved to Texas&lt;/a&gt; where he still spreads his antivax propaganda; he was on NBC’s TODAY show just this morning — what a coincidence! — &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37313063/ns/today-today_health/"&gt;still proclaiming his innocence&lt;/a&gt;, and still spreading falsehoods about vaccines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And falsehoods they are. From the NBC page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When [host Matt] Lauer asked Wakefield whether it’s dangerous to continue promoting an MMR-autism link when it causes many families to shy away from vaccinating their children, Wakefield answered, &amp;quot;Matt, you’re missing the point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The point is that despite denying it, in the public relations campaign they’ve used against me and against the parents, they are conceding these in vaccine court.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, that’s completely wrong, and he should know better. For one thing, courts have ruled &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/15/vaccines-win-their-day-in-court-again/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/03/13/vaccine-court-finds-no-link-to-autism/"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; that there is no evidence to link vaccines and autism. What Wakefield is most likely referring to is the Hannah Poling case, which can be twisted and spun into making it sound like it connects vaccines and autism, but it doesn’t. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=203"&gt;Read Steve Novella’s entry on that case&lt;/a&gt; to see how once again the truth eludes Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another, Lauer was not missing the point at all. &lt;em&gt;Wakefield was &lt;strong&gt;dodging&lt;/strong&gt; the point&lt;/em&gt;. Lauer was precisely correct; it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dangerous to promote a link that doesn’t exist between autism and vaccines, for exactly the reason Lauer stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would’ve been interesting indeed to see Matt Lauer following up that question with asking Wakefield about his huge financial conflict of interest in all this, since Wakefield &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/28/antivaxxers-and-their-trouble-with-truth/"&gt;was developing an alternative to vaccines&lt;/a&gt; when he wrote that paper. Or if he had anything to say about investigative journalist Brian Deer — a man who has been at the forefront of exposing Wakefield all along — and &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-deal.htm"&gt;the evidence he found&lt;/a&gt; that alleges Wakefield &lt;em&gt;was paid by lawyers to start a vaccine scare?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for years Wakefield has been claiming he’s the victim here. This news won’t change that, and will in fact make him a martyr to his reality-impaired followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not the victim here. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; victims are people who get measles, people who get rubella, people who get pertussis. Most of the time these folks recover and are fine, though miserable. But sometimes &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/04/dana-mccaffery/"&gt;it’s not such a happy ending&lt;/a&gt;. Dana McCaffery, a four week old girl in Australia, died last year because the herd immunity was too low where she lived. Because people chose not to vaccinate — and the antivax movement was strong there —  that little girl died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases all over the world, and in many of those regions the voices of Wakefield and the antivaxxers are strong. I’m glad the GMC finally took action and did the right thing, but this does not mean we must rest &lt;a href="http://vaccinecentral.wordpress.com/"&gt;in our fight&lt;/a&gt; against those zealots who believe — without any evidence, and plenty of evidence against them — that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They don’t&lt;/em&gt;. But how many kids will get sick before everyone finally realizes that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wakefield, who touched off an international controversy by claiming a possible link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism, has lost his medical license, but says he will continue to fight to prove his case. Do you think vaccines are related to autism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes.&lt;/strong&gt; So many more cases, so many more vaccinations - it can't just be coincidence.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt; There is no scientific evidence the two things are related.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm not sure&lt;/strong&gt;. There needs to be more research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as of right now, the "yes" votes are at 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a response to the doomsday fears I keep seeing expressed in response to the success of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to address one narrow point that is being discussed in the popular press and here on Edge: is Venter's technological tour de force a threat to humanity, another atom bomb in the hands of children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a threat, but this isn't it. If you want to worry, think about the teeming swarms of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites that all want to eat you, that are aided (as we are defended) by the powers of natural selection--we are a delectable feast, and nature will inevitably lead to opportunistic dining. That is a far, far bigger threat to &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, since they are the product of a few billion years of evolutionary refinement, not a brief tinkering probe into creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature's constant attempts to kill us are often neglected in these kinds of discussions as a kind of omnipresent background noise. Technology sometimes seems more dangerous because it moves fast and creates novelty at an amazing pace, but again, Venter's technology isn't the big worry. It's much easier and much cheaper to take an existing, ecologically successful bug and splice in a few new genes than to create a whole new creature from scratch...and unlike the de novo synthesis of life, that's a technology that's almost within the reach of garage-bound bio-hackers, and is definitely within the capacity of many foreign and domestic institutions. Frankenstein bacteria are harmless compared to the possibilities of hijacking &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; or a flu virus to nefarious ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promise and the long-term peril of the ability to synthesize new life is that it will lead to deeper understanding of basic biology. That, to me, is the real potential here: the ability to experimentally reduce the chemistry of life to a minimum, and use it as a reductionist platform to tease apart the poorly understood substrates of life. It's a poor strategy for building a bioweapon, but a great one for understanding how biochemistry and biology work.  That is the grand hope that we believe will give humanity an edge in its ongoing struggle with a dangerous nature: that we can bring forethought and deliberate, directed opposition to our fellow organisms that bring harm to us, and assistance to those that benefit us. And we need greater knowledge to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course more knowledge brings more power, and more possibility of catastrophe. But to worry over a development that is far less immediately dangerous than, say, site-directed mutagenesis, is to have misplaced priorities and to be basically recoiling from the progress of science. We either embrace the forward rush to greater knowledge, or we stand still and die. &lt;i&gt;Alea iacta est&lt;/i&gt;; I look forward to decades of revolutionary new ideas and discoveries and technologies. May we have many more refinements of Venter's innovation, a flowering of novel life forms, and deeper analyses of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/creation/creation_index.html"&gt;more at the link&lt;/a&gt;, with contributions from  Richard Dawkins, George Church, Nassim N. Taleb, Daniel C. Dennett, Dimitar Sasselov, Antony Hegarty, George Dyson, Kevin Kelly, and Freeman Dyson so far. I have to say I like Church's response best so far, since he tries to put it into an appropriate perspective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/i_aint_afraid_of_no_frankenste.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/M55XWTtvPi4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274726378775"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/junk_is_what_junk_does.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81950442d32ad841</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Molecular Biology"/><title type="html">Junk is what junk does</title><published>2010-05-24T17:57:40Z</published><updated>2010-05-24T17:57:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/YS-8FlWzhzU/junk_is_what_junk_does.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/junk_is_what_junk_does.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Randy Stimpson is someone a few may recall here: he was a particularly repetitious and dishonest creationist who earned himself a spot in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/plonk.php"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. One of the hallmarks of his obtuse way of 'thinking' is that he is a computer programmer, and so he was constantly making the category error of assuming the genome was a computer program, and therefore the product of intelligent design (never noticing that he himself is an example of how programming a computer requires relatively little intelligence). He &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/05/junk-dna-is-sti.html#comment-217735"&gt;objects to the notion of junk DNA on the Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt;, and I just have to tear apart his nonsensical assertions there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think we should rush to conclude that highly repetitive DNA is junk. I know it would be a mistake to think that about software. If you look at software executables (like .exe and .dll files on Windows computers) they are full of repeated sequences. You may have written a program yourself. If so, you would certainly be familiar with the concept of a subroutine or a method. At the assembly level, whenever a subroutine is called registers are pushed on the stack, when one returns they are popped of the stack. The code to push and pop registers is automatically generated by the complier and is therefore not apparent at the source code level. This translates into a massive amount of simplistic repetition at the binary level. These kinds of repetitive sequences would probably be classified as SINES by geneticists trying to understand the binary code. While this kind of code doesn't map to any kind of a program function it is essential.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You may also know that most software developers these days work with object oriented languages where inheritance and polymorphism are used to develop hierarchies of classes. At the source code level inheritance enables developers to reuse source code without retyping it. However, when source code is compiled into binary form the result is a massive amount of repetition, but of a more sophisticated nature than that of just pushing and popping registers. These kinds of repetitive sequences would probably be classified as LINES. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am familiar with software on far more intimate terms than most: I used to write code in assembly language, and could even read simple machine code on old 8-bit processors. I hacked together a p-code disassembler once upon a time. So yeah, I know what raw code looks like, as I'll assume Stimpson does, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know what DNA sequences look like. I can tell that Stimpson doesn&amp;#39;t have the slightest clue. No, the code to push and pop registers in a routine looks nothing like SINES, not in its distribution or in its pattern. No, standard library link codes look nothing like LINES in distribution or pattern, either. Since he mentions them, I can also explain that we know exactly what LINES and SINES do — he seems to assume that biologists must be idiots who haven&amp;#39;t bothered to look at the function of sequences. It&amp;#39;s a lovely example of projection, since it is obvious that Stimpson has never bothered to look at what these sequences are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A LINE is a Long Interspersed Nuclear Element. Some LINEs are actually a sort of functional gene that can be transcribed and translated; they are about 6500 base pairs long and encode a couple of proteins that do something very specific: they assemble into a complex that includes a strand of their own RNA (usually), migrate into the nucleus, where they nick the DNA and insert a copy of the RNA sequence into the genome. That's all they do, over and over. They're a kind of self-contained Xerox machine that spews more copies of themselves, which can make more copies of themselves, which can make more copies of themselves. They are not typically associated with any of your useful genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many copies do they make? Your genome contains approximately 868,000 copies of various LINE genes. Over 20% of your genome is nothing but this parasitic self-copier — it&amp;#39;s like spam all over the place. Don&amp;#39;t panic, though: this is another indicator of its status as useless junk, in that almost all of the copies are nonfunctional, either because they were sloppily inserted and are broken, or because they&amp;#39;ve accumulated destructive mutations (there is no harm to the reproductive capacity of the organism bearing them if a LINE acquires a stop codon), and because cells actively repress these parasites by, for instance, methylation and inactivation of stretches of DNA saturated with LINEs. Out of that huge number of copies, only 20-50 are estimated to retain any activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Mr Stimpson wants to consider computer analogies, I ask: what do we call a code sequence that has only one function, the repeated duplication of copies of itself in the operating system? Do we consider that a functional and useful part of the computer, or do we try to get rid of them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINEs, or Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements, are even more common — your genome contains 1.6 &lt;i&gt;million&lt;/i&gt; copies of various SINEs, taking up 13% of the genome (a lower percentage because even though there are more of them, they are shorter than LINEs). And remember, you only contain about 20,000 genes total,  or about 1% of the number of SINEs. A SINE is basically a truncated LINE, or any short sequence that contains regions preferentially recognized by the LINE transcriptase, so that it is carried into the nucleus and repeatedly inserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. A SINE is a parasite of a parasite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other repetitive elements are, for example, endogenous retroviruses: relics of past viral infections. These viruses make copies of themselves into the host DNA, and in ERVs we don&amp;#39;t just find transcriptase enzymes — we find viral coat proteins. These are sequences that also have a known function, as sites for the synthesis of infectious disease particles. So, sure, you could say they do &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; — it&amp;#39;s just not for our benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could these repetitive sequences do anything useful? Yes, to a small degree, and we even have examples of it…unfortunately, every time someone finds a rare example of a functional piece of repetitive DNA, the ignoramuses rhapsodize about how this demonstrates it could all be useful. No, it doesn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one role of some junk could be in position effects. We know that if a useful gene is located next to a chunk of inactivated DNA, its expression may be downregulated to some degree — it&amp;#39;s a kind of spillover of a passive effect of living next to a junkyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some of these junk DNA sequences are retrotransposons that insert themselves arbitrarily into the genome, they can also be a source of mutations; some may even find portions of their sequence incorporated into the product of a functional gene. An evolutionary biologist can see this as a possibly, rarely fruitful contribute to genetic diversity, but it should give no comfort to creationists, who don't much care for chance insertions and random variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other uses for some junk. There are structural regions of the chromosome, such as the area around the centromere, that are devoid of genes but just contain many repeats of short, untranscribed sequences. These are a kind of generic handle for proteins to glom onto, and contribute in a general way to how the chromosome works in the cell. There is also a general property of cell growth, that one of the triggers for cell division is the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic volume, so puffing up the genome with lots of extraneous nucleotides can lead to larger cells. Both of these functions, though, are not very sequence dependent — so sure, you could say they have a rough, general role: they are the plastic boxes and styrofoam packing peanuts of the functional elements of the genome. They may do something, but it&amp;#39;s not specific, and it&amp;#39;s not particularly dependent on the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junk DNA isn't merely stuff that we don't understand. It's stuff that we know something about, and know how it fits into the ecosystem of the cell, and that we call junk because we &lt;i&gt;know what it does&lt;/i&gt; — it mainly sits up in the attic, garage, and basement, gathering dust and taking up space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Stimpson: go read a decent molecular biology and genetics book, and stop relying on your irrelevant software manuals and the dishonest and ignorant pratings of your fellow creationists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/junk_is_what_junk_does.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YS-8FlWzhzU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274725684813"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=179274">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d7780ea41cbbb4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="Anna Paquin"/><category term="arm exercises"/><category term="Arms"/><category term="Best Celebrity Arms"/><category term="biceps"/><category term="Demi Moore"/><category term="dumbells"/><category term="Evangeline Lilly"/><category term="exercise"/><category term="First Lady Michelle Obama"/><category term="fitness"/><category term="Gwen Stefani"/><category term="Hilary Swank"/><category term="Jada Pinkett Smith"/><category term="Jessica Alba"/><category term="Kate Hudson"/><category term="Kelly Ripa"/><category term="Live with Regis and Kelly"/><category term="lost"/><category term="michelle obama"/><category term="summer"/><category term="triceps"/><category term="True Blood"/><category term="working out"/><title type="html">10 Best Celebrity Arms: Kate Hudson, Evangeline Lilly, and Anna Paquin</title><published>2010-05-24T17:36:45Z</published><updated>2010-05-24T17:36:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/10-best-celebrity-arms-kate-hudson-evangeline-lily-and-anna-paquin/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="width:143px"&gt;&lt;img title="stones in exile 110510" src="http://blisstree.com/files/2010/05/wenn54769611-133x200.jpg" alt="" width="133" height="200"&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo: WENN.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Charlie Brown always received pithy advice for his worries and anxiety.  Now a study of anxiety disorder treatment in primary supports a new cost-effective intervention model.Peter Roy-Byrne and colleagues summarized the result of randomized study of 1004 patients with anxiety disorder in primary care.  The subjects had at least one of four anxiety disorders: panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.  The study provided patients with the opportunity to receive cognitive behavior therapy, medication or a combination.  The treatment intervention showed superiority with a 51% remission rate compared to 33% for usual care.The structure of the intervention is informative for understanding use of technology in a multidisciplinary format to increase effectiveness and control costs.  After assessment, the intervention was guided by anxiety clinical specialists (ACS) who in the study included social workers, nurses and psychologists. The intervention was a program called Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM).  Key elements of this model included:Web-based monitoring systemModeled after Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT)Personnel received six 1/2 days of didactic trainingFive generic computer modules formed the core intervention (education, self-monitoring, hierarchy development, breathing training, and relapse prevention3 disorder specific modules (cognitive restructuring and exposure to internal and external stimuli)In addition to the intervention, a monitoring and outcome system provided ongoing assessment and targeted additional treatment.  Key elements of the monitoring protocol:Web-based tracking systemOASIS (Overall anxiety severity and impairment scale) and 3-item PHQ-9 scoresGoal is clinical remissionAdditional treatment available for non-response including stepped up CBT, medication adjustment or crossover to other modalityAfter treatment entered into continued careMonthly follow-up telephone callsRegular interaction with primary care physicianIf I were in charge of the Obamacare mental health program, I would encourage dissemination of this type of model.  The model maximizes anxiety treatment access within primary care.  Physicians coordinate the program but use a team and technology-based program to extend evidence-based treatment.The model also provides patients a choice between medication, therapy or both.  This flexibility is likely to improve compliance and increase patient satisfaction.  Many primary care practices in the U.S. offer medication treatment, but few have significant options for therapy.  Patients would benefit for extended access to both modes of treatment for anxiety and depression.This study also emphasizes the commonalities of treatment for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Common elements of treatment assist clinicians in addressing the specific types of anxiety disorders found in clinical practice.Photo of Dog Obedience Class Courtesy of Yates PhotographyRoy-Byrne, P., Craske, M., Sullivan, G., Rose, R., Edlund, M., Lang, A., Bystritsky, A., Welch, S., Chavira, D., Golinelli, D., Campbell-Sills, L., Sherbourne, C., &amp;amp; Stein, M.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Sonia Stephens to answer a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure. I'm originally from Minnesota, but moved to Hawaii when I was young. Now I'm living in Florida. So geographically, I've been all over the place, but I probably consider Hawaii "home". I was always interested in science and nature while growing up - while I was in Hawaii, that interest focused a bit on evolution and extinction. Hawaii is one of the evolution hotspots of the world, and now it's unfortunately one of the extinction hotspots as well. There are many, many biological, political, social, and economic factors that have combined to create this situation in the Hawaiian Islands. Invasive species, climate change, and dwindling supplies of fossil fuels are some specific problems that make it really obvious that "culture" and "nature" are not, and can never be, separate. This idea made a big impression on me in college, so my interest in ecology now is in this interface of the human and natural worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your (scientific) background? Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sonia Stephens pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Sonia%20Stephens%20pic.jpg" width="287" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;At the University of Hawaii, I studied the ecology of stream algae for my Master's. After graduating, I worked for the National Park Service on a program to inventory and set up a long-term monitoring plan for Pacific Island park natural resources. I started out working on streams and other freshwater ecosystems, some of which are pretty funky, like anchialine pools. These are brackish systems found in rocky coastal areas in Hawaii, connected to both fresh and salty groundwater through crevices in the basalt substrate. They harbor a unique flora and fauna that can cope with tidal changes in salinity. They're also culturally hugely important, as the only surface-level freshwater on these incredibly hot, dry coastal lava plains. Unfortunately, they're also hugely threatened by groundwater pollution, coastal development, and invasive species. So these were some of the key resources that the NPS wanted to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point at which I started to get interested in science communication was when I began working more in-depth on the actual writing of the monitoring plan, as well as coming up with conceptual models and diagrams to illustrate ecosystems and processes (like anchialine pools). I found it really interesting and challenging to translate some of the complicated ideas into pictures as tools to communicate with the public. A whole different question, though, is how to actually get those explanations and illustrations out to people. Traditionally, the NPS creates park displays, which can only be visited in person, and reports and newsletters, which are now downloadable. But these aren't necessarily the most far-reaching communication methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m interested in doing is exploring how scientific organizations can use online tools to communicate with the public. Right now, I&amp;#39;m a PhD student at the University of Central Florida, in the Texts &amp;amp; Technology program. This is a humanities-based program that emphasizes study of digital media, so it&amp;#39;s pretty interdisciplinary in both methodology and subject matter. What I&amp;#39;d like to do is shed some light on what online tools work best for what purposes, and why some tools work better for some types of communication than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as a grad student, classes and teaching are definitely taking up most of my time. Since my program is based in an English department, I'm teaching college composition this academic year as part of my financial support, which has been quite a learning experience for me.  This summer and next semester, I'll be going into taking my candidacy exams and planning research (assuming the exams go well), so that will take up the majority of my time. In my research, I'm planning to use both visual and science communication theories to look at online science communication. I'm definitely interested in doing some empirical research, but those ideas are still taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a blog, but I've been slowly dipping my toes into the social network aspect of the Internet. Facebook is a great way to keep track of what people are doing, but it does add to the occasional multitasking frenzy, so I'm not sure whether it's a net positive yet... My main interest in these tools is more along the lines of asking what they're good for, in terms of working on public understanding of science. I know a lot of writers like to use blogging as sort of a journaling tool, or a place to play with ideas. I've never really enjoyed journaling, but I'm starting to see how it might be useful in preparing for my exams (an idea I got from reading Christina Pikas's blog), so that might be a good way to get started blogging. Right now, &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/terpsinoe/home" title=""&gt;I have a fairly basic website online&lt;/a&gt; but I'm hoping to upgrade that soon...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool science blogs by the participants at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do read several of the blogs on the Science Blogs site, but honestly I usually just go to the 24-hour feed and look at what posts seem interesting. I do read a couple of nature blogs pretty regularly- one is by &lt;a href="http://juliezickefoose.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Julie Zickefoose&lt;/a&gt;, a nature writer &amp;amp; illustrator. and the other is by a birder, &lt;a href="http://www.birdchick.com/wp/" title=""&gt;Sharon Stiteler&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the blogs I read are generally politically oriented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, one of the questions that seemed to keep coming up at the meeting was: we have all these online tools to communicate with the public, but what tools work best in what situations? There's a need for research on how well efforts at online science communication work in what situations. Which, obviously, is where I'm trying to go with my studies. I won't promise to give a complete answer :-) but maybe I'll be able to shed some light on this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also saw a huge diversity of opinion about what science communication is, what blogging is for, whether we should be striving for science literacy vs. public understanding of science, etc. For these more philosophical questions, the answers really depend on the person doing the communicating. I think listening to the talks at the meeting and participating in some conversations helped me clarify some of those answers for myself and think about where I'd like to focus in my work. Personally, I'm involved in environmental activism, and I think that simply educating people about the science behind environmental issues is a huge step in creating sustainable social change. So my focus is on the public understanding of science, with the underlying goal of making the connections between "culture" and "nature" more obvious. Maybe in a few years, if I keep banging my head on a wall of public miseducation about statistics, for example, I'll shift my focus to science literacy. But for now, I'll try to start at least a little smaller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/05/scienceonline2010_-_interview_49.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/NQ9JqHz1GjI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274717143837"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a263fb86548681e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Andrew Wakefield: Struck off!</title><published>2010-05-24T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-05-24T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/_bnO1KGYSzw/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;It's been a long time comin'&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, happy day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's finally happened, more than six years after investigative reporter Brian Deer first reported Wakefield's massive conflicts of interest and dubious activities related to his "research" suggesting a link between the measles strain in the MMR vaccine and inflammation of the gut in autistic children, nearly three years after the start of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/andrew_wakefield_the_galileo_gambit_writ.php"&gt;British General Medical Council's hearings&lt;/a&gt; into anti-vaccine hero Andrew Wakefield's fitness to practice, nearly a year and a half after solid evidence that Andrew Wakefield had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/04/how_andrew_wakefield_invented_autistic_e.php"&gt;committed research fraud&lt;/a&gt; for this "study," and less than four months after the GMC ruled that Andrew Wakefield had acted with "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/02/the_martyrdom_of_st_andy.php"&gt;callous disregard for the distress and pain the children [who were his research subjects] might suffer&lt;/a&gt;." This morning in the U.K. the GMC ruled that, because of his unethical and dishonest behavior in conducting his research, Andrew Wakefield &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8695267.stm"&gt;should be "struck off" the medical register&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that he will no longer be licensed to practice medicine in the U.K.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The doctor who first suggested a link between MMR vaccinations and autism is to be struck off the medical register.

&lt;p&gt;The General Medical Council found Dr Andrew Wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct over the way he carried out his controversial research.&lt;br&gt;
It follows a GMC ruling earlier this year that he had acted unethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Wakefield, who is now based in the US, has consistently claimed the allegations are unfair. He now says he will appeal against the verdict.&lt;br&gt;
His 1998 Lancet study caused vaccination rates to plummet, resulting in a rise in measles - but the findings were later discredited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GMC ruled in January Dr Wakefield had acted "dishonestly and irresponsibly" in conducting his research, but under its procedures the sanctions are made at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All anyone who supports science-based medicine can say is: It's about time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, none of this prevents Wakefield from, as Sullivan put it so well, &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/dr-andrew-wakefield-turning-disgrace-into-publicity/"&gt;turning public disgrace into publicity&lt;/a&gt;. For example, there was this &lt;a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/26184891/vp/37312715"&gt;interview with Matt Lauer&lt;/a&gt; on NBC's The Today Show this morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 34, Piper Kerman went to  federal prison for a ten-year-old  drug smuggling and money laundering offense.  She spent 13 months in a  minimum-security correctional facility for  women in Danbury, CT, which  isn’t necessarily what you’d expect from a  blonde-haired, blue-eyed  Smith graduate and Red Sox fan from a nice, New  England family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper’s excellent memoir about her prison experience, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385523386?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=randohouseinc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0385523386target="&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange Is the New Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was just  published  by Random House – with back cover blurbs by Dave Eggers and  Elizabeth  Gilbert (not bad for a first-time writer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper sat down with Blisstree for the afternoon to discuss all   aspects of her time in the clink, from prison beauty products, physical activity, and  friendships to the torturous six years she and her  now-husband spent in  limbo between her  conviction and the day she  self-surrendered in Danbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the third segment of our exclusive video interview with   Piper, where we ask about her fitness routine in prison, discovering yoga behind bars, and the  challenge of maintaining her physical and mental health while locked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keep it here for Piper’s next video, coming soon – we even got   Piper’s husband, Larry Smith of &lt;a href="http://www.smithmag.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smith&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;, to talk on camera about his  side of the story&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But every now and again a picture comes along that’s so wonderful I just have to share it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one such piece of wonderfulness: &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/227-Hole-in-One!.html"&gt;a lunar hole in one&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/uploads/LROCiotw/M1225970LE_thumb.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/lro_holeinone.jpg" alt="lro_holeinone" title="lro_holeinone" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you thought the windmill at the end of putt putt golf was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture — click to enlunanate — is from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and shows a region of the Moon inside the crater Henry Frères. Taken on March 7, 2010, the image shows an area just 500 meters (550 yards) across — if it were Earth, you could easily walk across it in less than ten minutes — and shows objects down to less than a meter in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/lro_holeinone_zoom.jpg" alt="lro_holeinone_zoom" title="lro_holeinone_zoom" width="202" height="204"&gt;And it’s just so cool! Look at the dashed trail going from left to right. See how it ends at the little crater, and even — if you look closely — can be seen to turn downwards? It suspiciously points right to the 10-meter (30+ foot) boulder sitting just inside the crater wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspicious indeed. In fact, what you’re seeing is the trail left by that boulder as it rolled and bounced downhill and stopped inside the crater! Look at the big picture. From the debris (small rocks) running up and down, you can tell that the terrain on the left side of the picture slopes down to the middle (in other words, if you started on the left side and walked to the center of the picture you’d be going downhill). The middle of the picture is relatively level ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind’s eye, what happened here is clear. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The boulder starts off at the left, and something — perhaps a minor moonquake, or a nearby impact — shakes the ground. The house-sized rock gets dislodged, and in the gentle gravity begins to roll downhill. It hits something and bounces, coming back down, skidding and rolling, only to be launched into the sky again and again. It slows a bit each time — the ruts it digs get shorter as it moves left-to-right — and by the time it gets to the end of the track it’s barely moving, just enough to feel the change of slope due to the crater wall. It even rolled past the crater a bit (you can see the last groove is actually along the path a little beyond the crater), and &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; slows to a stop… but then slowwwwwwly teeters backwards, back along the path it came. Just as it’s about to come to a rest, it goes over the lip of the crater, slides into it, and lumbers to a halt halfway down the 60-meter (200 foot) crater’s wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would give a lot to be able to see video of something like this happening on the Moon in real time. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that boulder’s flight is just one of many scenes depicted here, which you can see if you let yourself explore. Just above the bouncing boulder’s path is a trail of what looks like a dustslide, a bit more brightly colored than the moonscape around it. It slid downhill to the right as well, and partially buried some of the bigger debris. Obviously, this happened &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the bigger rocks already slid down, since it buried some of them. And above that in the picture you can see fainter trails from other rocks sliding down. Those trails are harder to see, meaning they’re older (millions of years of micrometeorite impacts and thermal flexing from the Moon’s day/night cycle gradually erase features like that), which again is consistent with the picture I’m painting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/sloped_plume.jpg" alt="sloped_plume" title="sloped_plume" width="350" height="207"&gt;Take a look at the crater at the bottom left. It’s surrounded by a light-colored apron of ejected material. See how there’s more of that ejecta to the right than to the left? That’s what you’d expect if the slope goes downhill to the right; the material spreads out more as it falls downslope (the diagram here will help). And hmmm, there’s a small crater about 10 meters across just to the right and below the big crater with the boulder in it. That crater is fresher; it still has a light apron as well. But what’s that dark spot in the center? Beats me. Cool though, ain’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s so much to see and investigate, and &lt;em&gt;this image is only about the size of a city block!&lt;/em&gt; It’s a slice of a much longer 2.5 x 15 km strip, &lt;a href="http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc_browse/view/M122597190LE"&gt;which you can interactively browse, too&lt;/a&gt;. WARNING: be prepared to lose a lot of your day if you click that link, but it’s worth it, just like exploring &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/images/"&gt;the thousands of other pictures LRO has sent back&lt;/a&gt; is worth it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LRO mission cost roughly $600 million. There are 300 million people living in the US right now… so play with those images for a few minutes, and then let me know &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;if you got your two bucks’ worth out of this mission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;width:250px;float:right" src="http://www.secularstudents.org/files/muham.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m usually so proud of the way atheists are willing to stand up for their views.  But watching the drama unfold around Everybody Draw Muhammad Day, I’m left wondering what changed… and I’m a little disappointed.  It’s strange to see atheists arguing and criticizing each other for promoting an important message for fear that the message might offend people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; affiliates had an important idea to express: “No religious figure should be so revered as to be off limits to  criticism or even portrayal.  We do not believe Muhammad is holy and we  should be free to draw him.”  After &lt;strong&gt;Matt Stone&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Trey Parker&lt;/strong&gt; had their lives threatened, it became more apparent than ever that this message needed to be said.   And there is no better way to say it than with images of Muhammad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/10/whos-drawing-muhammad-now/"&gt;So they decided to draw Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;.  They bent over backward to provide accompanying messages, blog posts, and op-eds giving the context of their free-speech message.  But they were met with social uproar from their  Muslim peers, from the Interfaith Youth Core, and even from members of the  atheist community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the most puzzling objection came from &lt;strong&gt;Greg Epstein&lt;/strong&gt;, who at least seems to understand the students’ motivation.  In &lt;a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/20/my-take-everyone-chalk-mohammed/"&gt;a piece on CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between making fun of religious or  other ideas on a TV show that you can turn off, and doing it out in a  public square where those likely to take offense simply can’t avoid it.  These chalk drawings are not a seminar on free speech; they are the  atheist equivalent of the campus sidewalk preachers who used to irk me  back in college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s put this in perspective of the atheist movement’s past efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half ago, the American Humanist Association bought advertisements in major newspapers and in buses asking “Why believe in a god?  Just be good for goodness’ sake!”  Since then, the &lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/"&gt;United Coalition of  Reason&lt;/a&gt; organized local groups in  two dozen regions to band together  and buy large billboards proudly  bearing slogans like “Don’t believe in God?  You are not alone” and “Are  you good without God?  Millions  are.”  The campaigns were met with outrage, repeated  vandalism, and people taking offense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billboards and bus ads were not statements that could be turned off.   They were unavoidable for people driving down the   street or riding the bus: the messages were shoved in their faces.  But Epstein had no problem with the billboards and bus ads – the  book  tour for his New York Times bestseller &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGood-Without-God-Billion-Nonreligious%2Fdp%2F0061670111%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1268072066%26sr%3D1-1&amp;amp;tag=secularstuden-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Good Without God&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; rode the campaign’s coattails, gaining attention from the excitement they stirred  up.  And while there was the occasional atheist who asked why we bothered to “evangelize,” there was nowhere near as much worry over hurting people’s feelings.  Epstein and the rest of the atheist community paid no mind to the people who shouted that they were offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s no question that people were offended by the ad campaigns.  Even high-ranking politicians were willing to condemn them.  &lt;strong&gt;Iowa Governor Chet Culver&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2009/08/06/gov-culver-atheist-bus-ad-is-offensive/"&gt;bashed the local bus ads&lt;/a&gt; which read “Don’t believe in God?  You are not alone” and insisted that – you  guessed it – he was offended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was disturbed, personally, by the advertisement and I can  understand why other Iowans were also disturbed by the message that it  sent,” Culver said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question will likely become a legal battle, Culver said. He  deferred questions of whether the group deserves the same free speech  rights as Christian organizations to advertise on the buses to the Iowa  Attorney General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culver also declined to answer if he would also have gotten off the  bus had he been a rider, but noted that he would have been offended by  the ad’s message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="width:250px;margin:10px 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;text-align:center;font-size:smaller;border:1px dotted black"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/images/S1051621-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="CinciCoRSmall" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/CinciCoRSmall.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="250"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p style="padding:0 5px"&gt;The Cincinnati CoR billboard was taken down and moved after the site’s owner received “multiple, significant threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive the comparison home, look no further than what happened in Cincinnati: the billboard had to be taken down and moved because the landowner of the site &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/11/12/cincinnati-coalition-of-reason-billboard-taken-down-and-put-back-up-after-threat/"&gt;received &lt;strong&gt;multiple threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Did we ask ourselves whether we should have kept quiet or found another way to make our point?  No, we realized that our statement was more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone takes offense, we need to use it as a wake-up call that we’ve crossed a line in their eyes and ask ourselves whether to step back.  Sometimes we should – people get offended by swastikas, blackface, and slurs &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/13/muhammad-is-not-a-swastika/"&gt;because they promote deplorable ideas&lt;/a&gt;.  But what lines are being crossed by the two campaigns before us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some religious people got offended because we were disputing a cherished belief: that religion is necessary in society.  In their eyes it crossed a line for us to question such a sacred belief.  But the entire purpose of our ad campaign was to challenge that belief, so we ignored the offense and pressed onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Muslims got offended by drawings of Muhammad because the images didn’t give their prophet as much respect as they feel he deserves.  In their eyes it crossed a line for us to give him less than that level of respect.  But again, that is exactly the line we are intending to challenge.  We want to challenge the claim that Muhammad is so holy that he’s off-limits to critique or portrayal.  So we ignored the offense and pressed onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see remarkable parallels between the two campaigns.  Not all offense is worth altering course for.  We understood that when it came to our billboards and bus ads.  We need to wake up and apply the same thinking to Draw Muhammad Day.&lt;/p&gt;

There's lots to see and to digest. The problem is that Christianity has been disproved in every generation, especially since the Enlightenment. Christian apologists simply reinvent their faith in every generation to save it from refutation. What we have in subsequent generations is a slightly different form of the inherited branches of Christianity. As generation piles upon generation what we have are different forms of Christianity such that the Christianities of today would have suffered under the &lt;i&gt;Office of the Inquisition&lt;/i&gt; they are so far removed. And the Christianities of the future will be just as different as today's forms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-627618893094435541?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/X-37_upright.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/X-37_upright.jpg" alt="X-37_upright" title="X-37_upright" width="350" height="525"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Air Force has long been in the vanguard of space based operations, but of course much of that is secret (and rightly so). I had heard of the X-37 B — aka &lt;a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/us-air-force-launches-secret-flying-twinkie"&gt;the Flying Twinkie&lt;/a&gt; — for some time, but since there was so little info on it I didn’t write anything. But interestingly, through &lt;a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/05/23/125203/X-37B-Found-By-Amateur-Sky-Watchers"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; I learned that amateur satellite spotters &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/23/science/space/23secret.html?ref=global-home&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;have seen the X-37 B from the ground&lt;/a&gt;. Not many people know you can spot all sorts of satellites from your front yard; all you need in most cases is knowledge of your latitude and longitude and &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;a website with satellite listings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Info about the X-37 B is relatively tight, so it’s unclear what it’s being tested for. Surveillance is assured, since any satellite can be used for that. The Air Force says it has no offensive capabilities — I wonder if they mean the test shot launched last month, or the X-37 B itself — but it does have a payload capability for small satellites, and can be operated in orbit for at least 9 months. Its orbit takes it from -40° to +40° latitude. Go look at a globe and see what countries lie in that range that might be of interest to the military…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/05/airforce_scramjet.jpg" alt="airforce_scramjet" title="airforce_scramjet" width="300" height="252"&gt;Also of interest is that &lt;a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/05/23/0140242/Air-Force-Sets-Date-To-Fly-Mach-6-Scramjet"&gt;the Air Force is planning a test launch&lt;/a&gt; of a hypersonic scramjet called the X-51A, an aircraft capable of flight at speeds of  at least Mach 6 — &lt;em&gt;about 7000 kph!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/air-force-set-fly-mach-6-scramjet"&gt;That launch may happen as soon as May 25&lt;/a&gt;. Scramjets are fiercely complex technologically; while technically rockets, they use oxygen from the air instead of carrying it on board. This saves a lot of mass, and has a huge range of uses; military of course, but also civilian uses for aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw an early version of a scramjet a few years ago, and was awed by it; Mach 6 is &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;, and these things have an upper speed that may exceed that by quite a bit. When this tech tests out, it may revolutionize the whole world. Imagine getting from the US to Japan in an hour, or basically &lt;em&gt;from any point in the world to any other point in just a few of hours!&lt;/em&gt; In a hundred years, statements like that may seem quaint, but for now, it’s the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may knee-jerk and think the military will abuse this tech, but I understand that developing and using this sort of thing can help &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; conflicts… and may lead to a revolution as profound as the invention of the car, the airplane, and the spaceship.

The findings that are getting reported out of this paper didn't make sense to me, but I wondered if this was an issue with accuracy in reporting. So I went and found the paper. Turns out that the reporting is accurate, its the actual findings from the paper that confuse me. I really wanted to make sense of this paper, so I've been waiting a while to blog about it. But I can't make sense of one key finding.

Figure 1: An artist's rendition of me, being confused. If, you know, I were an otter.

But before we get to the confused, let's just review the paper, shall we?

The basic finding is that personality, energy expenditure, and longevity are correlated in domestic dogs. Dogs are a really good species to study the potential relationships between psychological attributes (like obedience), physical attributes (like body mass), physiological attributes (such as energy expenditure or metabolism), and average length of life.

I just read a nice little article on speech production from Cognition and while I enjoyed it, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but wonder how it got published because it was rather light weight. To be fair, Cognition published it as a &amp;quot;Brief article&amp;quot; so it was meant to be short*; nonetheless, it had the feel of a grad student poster, not a publication. You might argue that this is the point of a &amp;quot;Brief article&amp;quot;,  but I will argue that similar content would likely not have been published had it not been recognizably associated with a well known scholar. Despite the precautions of blind reviews, it is not uncommon for a linguistics reviewer to have a pretty good idea of who authored or co-authored a paper, simply because linguistics is a small field, and the sub-fields even smaller. Most scholars have easy-to-recognize methodologies, content areas, or style that acts almost as a scholarly fingerprint. I don&amp;#39;t mean to be mean-spirited, I hope this doesn&amp;#39;t come across that way, but minus the second author&amp;#39;s fingerprint, I don&amp;#39;t see this paper getting accepted.But first, let&amp;#39;s look at the paper itself: A purple giraffe is faster than a purple elephant: Inconsistent phonology affects determiner selection in English (full citation below).From the abstract: &amp;quot;during the production of a determiner–noun phrase, nouns automatically activate the phonological forms of their determiners, which can compete with the phonological forms that are generated by an assimilation rule.&amp;quot; As I understand it, this means that nouns activate default articles when we&amp;#39;re about to say them. Show me a picture of an orange giraffe, and I think a orange giraffe before I say an orange giraffe. because I haven&amp;#39;t yet applied the phonological process that says the indefinite article a becomes an when followed by a vowel. This leads to competition between a and an to see which one will actually be said out loud. What the researchers found was that the phrase an orange giraffe was produced more slowly than a purple giraffe and they argue that this slowness (aka, naming latency) is the result of the extra time it takes to apply the phonological process to the indefinite article (aka determiner competition).  By putting the adjective orange in between the article and the noun, they were able to show that it was the noun driving this effect, not the adjective (because the indefinite article agreed with the noun originally, thus the slowness).Like I said, a nice little article. Cute little paradigm, good results, nice work. But here&amp;#39;s the thing: more than a dozen previously published articles say the same thing. There&amp;#39;s nothing new here. What this research does is drill down to test a detail of a well known phenomenon (determiner competition), namely that phonology alone can invoke this competition. In the authors&amp;#39; own words: &amp;quot;the lexical-syntactic level may not be necessarily involved.&amp;quot;  Let me repeat: X may not be necessarily involved in Y. Wow, that&amp;#39;s hardly a bold statement worthy of a journal publication. There was really only one experiment reported (a second experiment was included, but imho, it was so similar to the first, it hardly counts as a second). I have no problem with this as an experiment and it would be a good poster at a psycholinguistics conference or the LSA. but I can&amp;#39;t image being able to publish something like this myself, nor anyone I went to grad school with because we simply didn&amp;#39;t have the institutional ooomph to guide something as light as this through the review process.Yes yes, again I know the process is &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot;, but this article does have Kathryn Bock&amp;#39;s fingerprint. She&amp;#39;s well known for publishing on sentence production in general as well as number agreement in sentence production, a similar if not exact match to determiner agreement. And she&amp;#39;s a well respected psycholinguist by any measure. I&amp;#39;d have to re-read a bunch of her papers to see how closely the methods and presentation match her work, but I&amp;#39;d guess that a &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; reviewer, who would by necessity be familiar with sentence production literature, would not have a hard time guessing that this work was done in conjunction with Bock. The blind process actually allows such unintentional and intentional biases to fester because it&amp;#39;s hidden and hard to prove. If the process were transparent, I suspect this sort of thing wouldn&amp;#39;t happen as much. I&amp;#39;m all for open reviewing. I&amp;#39;d prefer all open, transparent reviewing.

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for not blogging this properly. I have just written an article for someone else, and can’t post the same text here. I will endeavour to do so in the next few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here are the findings on Wakefield from the GMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPOILER ALERT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly the Panel has determined that Dr Wakefield’s name should be erased from the medical register.  The Panel concluded that it is the only sanction that is appropriate to protect patients and is in the wider public interest, including the maintenance of public trust and confidence in the profession and is proportionate to the serious and wide-ranging findings made against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the foregoing direction is that, unless Dr Wakefield exercises his right of appeal, his name will be erased from the Medical Register 28 days from when formal notice has been deemed to be served upon him by letter to his registered address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date: 24 May 2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Andrew Jeremy WAKEFIELD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determination on Serious Professional Misconduct (SPM) and sanction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel has already given its findings on the facts and its reasons for determining that the facts as found proved could amount to serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then went on to consider and determine whether, under Rule 29(1) of the General Medical Council Preliminary Proceedings Committee and Professional Conduct Committee (Procedure) Rules Order of Council 1988, the facts as admitted or found proved do amount to serious professional misconduct and if so, what, if any sanction it should impose. It has accepted the Legal Assessor’s advice in full as to the approach to be taken in this case, and has looked at each doctors’ case separately but, when considering whether Dr Wakefield is guilty of serious professional misconduct, has looked at the heads of charge found proved against him as a whole. It has not confined its consideration to the heads of charge; it has also had regard to the evidence that has been adduced and the submissions made by Ms Smith on behalf of the General Medical Council. On behalf of Dr Wakefield, no evidence has been adduced and no arguments or pleas in mitigation have been addressed to the Panel at this stage of the proceedings. In fact Mr Coonan specifically submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      “……we call no evidence and we make no substantive submissions on behalf of Dr Wakefield at this stage.” “…I am instructed to make no further observations in this case”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, the Panel considered the totality of the evidence in Dr Wakefield’s case including the reference dated 27 October 1995, from Professor Leon Fine, the then Head of the Department of Medicine at the Royal Free Hospital, when reaching its decision at this stage, having been asked to consider that as part of Mr Coonan’s submissions at Stage 1.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious professional misconduct has no specific definition but in Roylance v General Medical Council [1999]  Lloyd’s Rep. Med. 139 at 149 Lord Clyde, in giving the reasons of the Privy Council, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      “Misconduct is a word of general effect, involving some act or omission which falls short of what would be proper in the circumstances. The standard of propriety may often be found by reference to the rules and standards ordinarily required by a medical practitioner in the particular circumstances…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Clyde went on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      “The misconduct is qualified in two respects. First, it is qualified by the word ‘professional’ which links the misconduct to the profession of medicine. Secondly, the misconduct is qualified by the word ‘serious’. It is not any professional misconduct which will qualify. The professional misconduct must be serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel has acted as an independent and impartial tribunal and exercised its own judgement on these matters. It has borne in mind the relevant GMC guidance at the time, namely the 1995 Good Medical Practice and, in so far as the findings relate to events after 1998, the 1998 Good Medical Practice. It has considered what has been adduced and submitted on behalf of the doctors about the standards and procedures which were prevalent at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In considering Dr Wakefield’s case, the Panel has also taken into account the passage of time before these matters were brought before it and the length of time this case has taken. It noted that the multiple sittings were for a variety of reasons including professional commitments of the Panel and requests from Counsel for reasons such as illnesses, accidents, unavailability of witnesses and preparation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel has noted Dr Wakefield’s previous good character and taken into account everything it has heard including his qualifications, experience and standing within the profession, with patients and the parents of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel considered the conduct of Dr Wakefield whilst he was registered as a medical practitioner and employed by the Royal Free Hospital Medical School in 1996 and 1997, initially as a Senior Lecturer in the Departments of Medicine and Histopathology.  Later, from 1 May 1997 he was a Reader in Experimental Gastroenterology and an Honorary Consultant in Experimental Gastroenterology at the Royal Free Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel has already found proved that Dr Wakefield’s Honorary Consultant appointment was subject to a stipulation that he would not have any involvement in the clinical management of patients. On five occasions (child 2, 4, 5, 12 and 7) he ordered investigations on children, when he had no paediatric qualifications, and in contravention of the limitations on his appointment.   The Panel considered this alone constituted a breach of trust of patients and employers alike.            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 1996 Dr Wakefield agreed to act as an expert in respect of MMR litigation. In relation to the Legal Aid Board (LAB), the Panel found that Dr Wakefield accepted monies totalling £50,000 procured through Mr Barr, the Claimants’ solicitor to pursue research.  A costing proposal had been submitted by Mr Barr to the LAB containing detailed information provided by Dr Wakefield, and Dr Wakefield ought to have realised that Mr Barr would submit it to the LAB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The costing proposal set out costs in respect of the investigation of five children. It covered each child’s four-night stay in hospital with colonoscopy, MRI and evoked potential studies.  Dr Wakefield admitted that the funding subsequently provided by the Legal Aid Board had not been needed for these items because these costs were borne by the National Health Service as the patients were being admitted as NHS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel found that Dr Wakefield had a duty to disclose this information to the Legal Aid Board via Mr Barr. It was dishonest and misleading of him not to have done so.  The Panel concluded that his intention to mislead the Legal Aid Board was sufficient on its own to amount to serious professional misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel also found that in respect of £25,000 of LAB monies, Dr Wakefield caused or permitted it to be used for purposes other than those for which he said it was needed and for which it had been granted. In doing so he was in breach of his duties in relation to the managing of, and accounting for, funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1996 Dr Wakefield made an application to the Ethical Practices Sub-Committee of the Royal Free Hospital (Ethics Committee) seeking approval for a research project involving 25 children. This was approved by the sub-Committee as Project 172-96. He named himself as one of the three Responsible Consultants, thereby taking on the shared responsibility for the information given in support of his application; for ensuring that only children meeting the inclusion criteria would be admitted to the study; that conditions attached to the Ethics Committee approval would be complied with; and that children would be treated in accordance with the terms of the approval given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In respect of Research and Ethics Committee approval, the Panel had regard to the particular ethical guiding principles with regard to conducting research on children. It rejected Dr Wakefield’s overall contention that Project 172-96 was never undertaken; that all the investigations carried out on the children were clinically indicated and that the research elements of the project were covered by another Ethics Committee approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel concluded that the programme of investigations that these children were subjected to was part of Project 172-96. It further determined that the conditions for approval and the inclusion criteria for that project were not complied with.  The Ethics Committee’s reliance on the probity of Dr Wakefield as a Responsible Consultant was not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to nine of the eleven children (2,1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 5,12 and &lt;img src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)"&gt; considered by the Panel, it  determined that Dr Wakefield caused research to be undertaken on them without Ethics Committee approval and thus without the ethical constraints that safeguard research. Ethical constraints are there for the protection both of research subjects and for the reassurance of the public and are crucial to public trust in research medicine.  It was in the context of this research project that the Panel found that Dr Wakefield caused three of these young and vulnerable children, (nos. 3, 9 and 12) to undergo the invasive procedure of lumbar puncture when such investigation was for research purposes and was not clinically indicated. This action was contrary to his representation to the Ethics Committee that all the procedures were clinically indicated. In nine of the eleven children (2,1, 3, 4, 9, 5,12, 8 and 7) the Panel has found that Dr Wakefield acted contrary to the clinical interests of each child. The Panel is profoundly concerned that Dr Wakefield repeatedly breached fundamental principles of research medicine. It concluded that his actions in this area alone were sufficient to amount to serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the research project were written up as an early report in the Lancet in February 1998. Dr Wakefield as a senior author undertook the drafting of the Lancet paper and wrote its final version. The reporting in that paper of a temporal link between gastrointestinal disease, developmental regression and the MMR vaccination had major public health implications and Dr Wakefield admitted that he knew it would attract intense public and media interest.  The potential implications were therefore clear to him, as demonstrated in his correspondence with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and reports which had already appeared in the medical press. In the circumstances, Dr Wakefield had a clear and compelling duty to ensure that the factual information contained in the paper was true and accurate and he failed in this duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children described in the Lancet paper were admitted for research purposes under a programme of investigations for Project 172-96 and the purpose of the project was to investigate the postulated new syndrome following vaccination.  In the paper, Dr Wakefield failed to state that this was the case and the Panel concluded that this was dishonest, in that his failure was intentional and that it was irresponsible. His conduct resulted in a misleading description of the patient population. This was a matter which was fundamental to the understanding of the study and the terms under which it was conducted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the failure to state that the children were part of a project to investigate the new syndrome, the Lancet paper also stated that the children had been consecutively referred to the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology with a history of a pervasive developmental disorder and intestinal symptoms.  This description implied that the children had been referred to the gastroenterology department with gastrointestinal symptoms and that the investigators had played no active part in that referral process.  In fact, the Panel has found that some of the children were not routine referrals to the gastroenterology department in that either they lacked a reported history of gastrointestinal symptoms and/or that Dr Wakefield had been actively involved in the process of referral. In those circumstances the Panel concluded that the description of the referral process was irresponsible, misleading and in breach of Dr Wakefield’s duty as a senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement in the Lancet paper that investigations reported in it were approved by the Royal Free Hospital Ethics Committee when they were not, was irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent to the paper’s publication, Dr Wakefield had two occasions on which he could have corrected the content of the Lancet paper yet both times he compounded his misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in a published letter in response to correspondents who had suggested that there had been biased selection of the Lancet children, Dr Wakefield stated that the children had been referred through the normal channels, a response which was dishonest and irresponsible. He provided an inaccurate statement which omitted relevant information when he knew that the description of the population in the study was being questioned by the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, at a meeting of the Medical Research Council, the Chair, Professor Sir John Pattison referred to the seriousness and importance of the implications of Dr Wakefield’s research and its major public health implications.  At that meeting and on  the issue of bias in generating the series of cases, Dr Wakefield stated that the children had come by “the standard route”, a response which was dishonest and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the issues of conflicts of interest, Dr Wakefield did not disclose matters which could legitimately give rise to a perception of a conflict of interest. He failed to disclose to the Ethics Committee and to the Editor of the Lancet his involvement in the MMR litigation and his receipt of funding from the Legal Aid Board. He also failed to disclose to the Editor of the Lancet his involvement as the inventor of a patent relating to a new vaccine for the elimination of the measles virus (Transfer Factor) which he also claimed in the patent  application, would be a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the publication of the Lancet Paper, eminent professionals had expressed concerns about the LAB funding to Dr Wakefield and potential conflicts of interest. Dr Wakefield rejected these views. With regard to non-disclosure to the Ethics Committee, Dr Wakefield did in evidence accept that the Legal Aid Board funding should have been disclosed, but said that his involvement in the litigation need not, especially because of his interpretation of the questions in the application form.  He said no question was asked which related to that matter and therefore felt no need to disclose. In evidence to the panel he stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “The form is set out expecting certain answers to specific questions and no such question exists. Therefore, since it was not asked, it was not answered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, given the importance of an Ethics Committee’s reliance on the probity of an applicant, the Panel determined that this was a failure by Dr Wakefield and his actions amounted to serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to the non-disclosure to the Lancet the Panel accepted evidence from the Editor of the Lancet, as to the importance of this issue. The Lancet published clear guidance in relation to the conflict of interest test that the applicant should apply and the need to discuss any issues arising from it with the Editor.  The Lancet test was:  “Is there anything that would embarrass you if it were to emerge after publication and you had not declared it?” Dr Wakefield chose not to declare or discuss any conflict of interest with the Editor. He stated that he was able to reconcile his position, was not embarrassed by it, and was quite proud of the position he had taken on behalf of the Lancet children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Wakefield was insistent that his involvement with the new patent had not given rise to any prior need to disclose.  Despite the clear terms of the patent, he did not accept that the invention was envisaged as an alternative vaccine to MMR. He acknowledged that he had envisaged the use of transfer factor for at least a proportion of the population and that he had a financial and career interest in its success, but he said that it did not cross his mind to disclose it, and even with hindsight he insisted that there was a reasonable argument, as he put it, for non-disclosure. The Panel considered that his actions and his persistent lack of insight as to the gravity of his conduct amounted to serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In relation to the administration of Transfer Factor to Child 10, the Panel noted the admitted background of Dr Wakefield’s involvement in a company set up with Child 10’s father as Managing Director, to produce and sell Transfer Factor. Around the same time, Dr Wakefield inappropriately caused Child 10 to be administered transfer factor. The Panel accepted that information as to its safety had been obtained and that the approval to administer Transfer Factor to one child was granted in the form of “Chairman’s approval”, “on a named patient basis” in a letter from Dr Geoffrey Lloyd, Chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee at the Royal Free Hospital. Nonetheless the Panel found that Dr Wakefield was at fault because the substance was given for experimental reasons, he did not cause the details to be recorded in the child’s records, or cause the general practitioner to be informed, and he did not have the requisite paediatric qualifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr Wakefield’s actions were contrary to the clinical interests of Child 10 and an abuse of his position of trust as a medical practitioner. The Panel considered these to be serious departures from the standards of a registered medical practitioner and concluded that these amounted individually and collectively to serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Wakefield caused blood to be taken from a group of children for research purposes at a birthday party, which the Panel found to be an inappropriate social setting.  He behaved unethically in failing to seek Ethics Committee approval; he showed callous disregard for any distress or pain the children might suffer, and he paid the children £5 reward for giving their blood.  He then described the episode in humorous terms at a public presentation and expressed an intention to repeat his conduct. When giving evidence to the Panel, Dr Wakefield expressed some regret regarding his remarks. The Panel was concerned at Dr Wakefield’s apparent lack of serious consideration to the relevant ethical issues and the abuse of his position of trust as a medical practitioner with regard to his conduct in causing the blood to be taken. The Panel concluded that his conduct brought the medical profession into disrepute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Wakefield defended the ethical basis for the taking of blood at a birthday party contrary to the experts who gave evidence to the Panel and who strongly condemned this action. The Panel determined that his conduct fell seriously short of the standards expected of a doctor and was a breach of the trust which the public is entitled to have in members of the medical profession. It concluded that this behaviour amounted to serious professional misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel has borne in mind the principles guiding a doctor as set out in the relevant paragraphs of 1995 Good Medical Practice which relate to providing a good standard of practice and care, good clinical care, keeping up-to-date, abuse of professional position, probity in professional practice, financial and commercial dealings, and the general principles of conflict of interest, followed by particular provisions as to the way in which research must be conducted.  The 1998 Good Medical Practice, relevant to Dr Wakefield’s conduct at the birthday party, lists the duties of a doctor in providing a good standard of practice and care, keeping up-to-date and the issue of research and the absolute duty to conduct all research with honesty and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the circumstances and taking into account the standard which might be expected of a doctor practising in the same field of medicine in similar circumstances in or around 1996-1998, the Panel concluded that Dr Wakefield’s misconduct not only collectively amounts to serious professional misconduct, over a timeframe from 1996 to 1999, but also, when considered individually, constitutes multiple separate instances of serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly the Panel finds Dr Wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In considering what, if any, sanction to apply, the Panel was mindful at all times of the need for proportionality and the public interest which includes not only the protection of patients and the public at large, but also setting and maintaining standards within the medical profession, as well as safeguarding its reputation and maintaining public confidence in the profession. It bore in mind that the purpose of sanctions is not punitive, although that might be their effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel noted the submissions of GMC Counsel that the appropriate and proportionate sanction would be erasure in light of his serious and wide-ranging misconduct. However the Panel accepted the Legal Assessor’s advice that this was only a submission on behalf of the GMC and it was for the Panel to make up its own mind. Dr Wakefield’s counsel did not make any substantive submissions on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel went on to consider whether it should, pursuant to Rule 30(1), postpone the case. It received no submissions in this regard and so went on to determine whether it was sufficient to conclude the case without making a direction or with an admonition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel made findings of transgressions in many aspects of Dr Wakefield’s research. It made findings of dishonesty in regard to his writing of a scientific paper that had major implications for public health, and with regard to his subsequent representations to a scientific body and to colleagues. He was dishonest in respect of the LAB funds secured for research as well as being misleading. Furthermore he was in breach of his duty to manage finances as well as to account for funds that he did not need to the donor of those funds. In causing blood samples to be taken from children at a birthday party, he callously disregarded the pain and distress young children might suffer and behaved in a way which brought the profession into disrepute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the nature, number and seriousness of the findings the Panel concluded it would be wholly inappropriate to conclude the case without making a direction or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with a reprimand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It next considered under rule 31 whether it was sufficient to direct that the registration of Dr Wakefield be conditional on his compliance during a period not exceeding three years with such requirements as the (Panel) may think fit to impose for the protection of members of the public or in his interests. Conditions have to be practicable, workable, measurable and verifiable and directed at the particular shortcomings identified. The Panel concluded that Dr Wakefield’s shortcomings and the aggravating factors in this case including in broad terms the wide-ranging transgressions relating to every aspect of his research; his disregard for the clinical interests of vulnerable patients; his failure to heed the warnings he received in relation to the potential conflicts of interest associated with his Legal Aid Board funding; his failure to disclose the patent; his dishonesty and the compounding of that dishonesty in relation to the drafting of the Lancet paper; and his subsequent representations about it, all played out against a background of research involving such major public health implications, could not be addressed by any conditions on his registration.  In addition, the Panel considered that his actions relating to the taking of blood at the party exemplifies a fundamental failure in the ethical standards expected of a medical practitioner. It concluded that conditional registration would not mark the seriousness of such fundamental failings in his duty as a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel next went on to consider whether it would be sufficient to suspend Dr Wakefield’s registration for a period not exceeding twelve months. Dr Wakefield has demonstrated a persistent lack of insight and has insisted in many instances on his ethical propriety: in the context of the referral process and the treatment of the children in the research project in which he was engaged; in the context of the funding of the project; with regard to the terminology of the Lancet paper; with regard to his non-declaration of interests; with regard to not acting in the best clinical interests of the Lancet children and with regard to obtaining blood from children at a birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panel noted that the sanction of suspension may be appropriate for conduct that falls short of being fundamentally incompatible with continued registration; where there is no evidence of harmful deep-seated or attitudinal problems; and where there is insight and no significant risk of repeating behaviour.  Although these points have been set out in the GMC’s Indicative Sanctions Guidance which was published subsequent to these events, the Panel considered that the guidance outlines the type of sanction appropriate to the gravity of misconduct and that the same principles are applicable to Dr Wakefield’s actions at the material times. The Panel considers that Dr Wakefield’s conduct in relation to the facts found falls seriously short of the relevant standards and that suspension would not be sufficient or appropriate against a background of several aggravating factors and in the absence of any mitigating submissions made on his behalf. Dr Wakefield’s continued lack of insight as to his misconduct serve only to satisfy the Panel that suspension is not sufficient and that his actions are incompatible with his continued registration as a medical practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly the Panel has determined that Dr Wakefield’s name should be erased from the medical register.  The Panel concluded that it is the only sanction that is appropriate to protect patients and is in the wider public interest, including the maintenance of public trust and confidence in the profession and is proportionate to the serious and wide-ranging findings made against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of the foregoing direction is that, unless Dr Wakefield exercises his right of appeal, his name will be erased from the Medical Register 28 days from when formal notice has been deemed to be served upon him by letter to his registered address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Wakefield is presently not subject to any interim order on his registration. The Panel will hear submissions on whether an immediate order of suspension should be imposed upon him pending the outcome of any appeal, first from Ms Smith on behalf of the General Medical Council and then from Mr Coonan on behalf of the doctor but will do that at the conclusion of the reading of all three determinations.  &lt;/p&gt;

But my departure from Facebook has co-incided with something of a global trend, so I thought I may as well explore what people thought. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In case you've been wrapped in roofing felt for the last few weeks, here's the scoop. After a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/10099178.stm"&gt;series of embarrassing security flaws&lt;/a&gt; and anger over the company's &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8681730.stm"&gt;attitude toward privacy&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook users are leaving in droves. Or at least, that's the claim - the reality is that there's no viable alternative yet, although &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/10128476.stm"&gt;some bright young things are working on a solution to that&lt;/a&gt;, playfully called Diaspora. The excommunication of oneself from Facebook is no new thing, and there are even &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.seppukoo.com/"&gt;applications&lt;/a&gt; developed exclusively to assist with your online suicide, like virtual &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_machine#Thanatron"&gt;Thanatrons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But here's the rub: although my departure has coincided with an &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt; evacuation of the social networking site, I just happened to be by the door when the alarms went off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/05/why_i_left_facebook_and_then_w.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/05/why_i_left_facebook_and_then_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274707708074"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=179212">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bb60072fd8e986ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="funny quotes"/><category term="humor"/><category term="quote of the day"/><title type="html">Harold Wilson's Optimism: Quote of the Day</title><published>2010-05-24T11:30:54Z</published><updated>2010-05-24T11:30:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/harold-wilsons-optimism-quote-of-the-day/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I am an optimist.

Every time I mention one, I know there'll be a bunch of people complaining that it is too far or too expensive, but the hope is that &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; will be in your region and in your price range. This one is in &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/"&gt;Montreal on 1-3 October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One huge relief: the Richard Dawkins award this year is going to Susan Jacoby, a wonderful choice. There will be no controversy at all this time, and it's well-deserved: if you haven't read &lt;i&gt;Freethinkers&lt;/i&gt; yet, you should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although…they couldn&amp;#39;t resist. It&amp;#39;s like a red cape to a bull. They just had to put a poll on their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/"&gt;Are you excited about going to Montreal?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes 100%&lt;br&gt;
No 0%&lt;br&gt;	
Can't make it 0%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the majority of the people in the world cannot possibly go to this event, all you have to do is answer honestly and they'll have to pull the poll as not quite good PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I wonder if a certain Nostradamus-lovin' kook will attend? Having a psycho yelling "YOU ARE FINISHED!" to signal the end of each talk might be useful, although the constant setting of goats on fire might be disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm sure he's not hurting, though: his celebrity friends will love him more, and his price for speaking engagements has no doubt just shot up as a consequence of being able to add 'martyr' after his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He'll have to stop doing children's birthday parties, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the panel hearing the case took exception with the way he gathered blood samples. Dr Wakefield paid children £5 for the samples at his son&amp;#39;s birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst. Party. Ever. Imagine going to your best friend's birthday party, and instead of a clown and balloons, there's his creepy old dad standing there with a role of banknotes and a great big syringe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/disgrace.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UR0clBnuNPI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1274707359554"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/marys_monday_metazoan_the_scar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b770002a52123d88</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary's Monday Metazoan: The scary movie date model</title><published>2010-05-24T12:48:13Z</published><updated>2010-05-24T12:48:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/0y3Wzb_6cdQ/marys_monday_metazoan_the_scar.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/05/marys_monday_metazoan_the_scar.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This story about &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100521-science-animals-antelope-topi-males-trick-females/"&gt;antelope trickery&lt;/a&gt; struck a chord with me.

&lt;p&gt;May 24, 2010--Raleigh, NC - Triangle PechaKucha is pleased to announce their third PechaKucha Night sponsored by Lonerider Beer, Relevance and Yelp!. The event will take place in Durham, NC, on June 17th, 2010, at 7:30 pm (doors open at 6:30). The event is free, but to attend you must register. Space is limited. &lt;a href="http://www.pknraleigh.com/" title=""&gt;Go here to register&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it? PechaKucha Nights are local idea-sharing events in the 20 x 20 format: speakers present 20 slides for 20 seconds per slide. Slides advance automatically to keep things moving forward at a rapid pace. Anyone can present, but meaningful PechaKucha presentations are the ones that uncover the unexpected -- unexpected talent, unexpected ideas. The key to a great presentation is to present something you feel passionate about. Many people use PechaKucha Night to present their latest creative projects or work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More about the PechaKucha Foundation  &lt;br&gt;
Devised and shared by Klein Dytham Architecture in 2003 as a place for designers, developers, and architects to meet, network, and show their work in public, PechaKucha Night now takes place in 226 Cities around the world. To learn more about the global Pecha Kucha organization visit: www.pecha-kucha.org.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I wonder if the business world will ever experiment with the Pecha Kucha form for meetings. IMAGINE PEOPLE - concise, well-rehearsed presentations in under ten minutes, with plenty of time left for questions. Think it's possible to end Death-By-PowerPoint in such a hip way?" - &lt;a href="http://digitalblueglobal.wordpress.com/2007/09/11/the-not-so-ancient-art-of-pecha-kucha/" title=""&gt;The Not-So-Ancient Art of Pecha Kucha&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of Pecha Kucha Night lies in the tension between the chaos of a full-blown party and the politeness of an art school crit, with the snappy pace holding it all together." - &lt;a href="http://www.aqworks.com/2007/07/03/pecha-kucha-nights-and-beer-a-sober-guide-to-better-presentation-skills/" title=""&gt;Pecha Kucha Nights and Beer: a Sober Guide to Better Presentations  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Gardner was a skeptic before there  was a skeptical movement, and so has always been one of our intellectual  giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of him I cannot help but think of the phrase most  famously used by Isaac Newton,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I have seen a little further it is by  standing on  the shoulders of  Giants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact another giant in  the skeptical universe, and long  time friend of Gardner, James Randi, felt the same way. He &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/995-my-world-is-a-little-darker.html"&gt;wrote  in  Swift&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That man was one of my giants, a very long-time friend of   some 50 years  or so.  He was a delight, a very bright spot in my  firmament, one to  whom I could always turn to with a question or an  idea, with any strange  notion I could invent, and with any complaint or  comment I could come  up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But to skeptics Gardner is  best known for his tireless and unapologetic opposition to  pseudoscience. His book, &lt;em&gt;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&lt;/em&gt;,  is a classic of skepticism first published in 1952. If you have not  read the book before, pick it up. I think you will find that it is just as  relevant today (which itself is an interesting commentary). He takes on  old favorites like creationism, UFOs, dowsing, Scientology, and even  organic farming. But he also takes on some names you may not recognize,  like Fletcherism (getting more from food by chewing it beyond  thoroughly) and the Bates methods (an alternative eye treatment still  around today) – but showing that while the characters and details may  change over time, pseudoscience itself is remarkably consistent in its  fallacies. He followed up with &lt;em&gt;Science: Good, Bad, and Bogus&lt;/em&gt; in  1981 – also worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprisingly Gardner was there at  the beginning of the modern skeptical movement, arguably begun with the  founding of CSICOP (The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of  Claims of the Paranormal, now renamed CSI – Committee for Skeptical Inquiry). He  was a founding fellow and wrote the &lt;em&gt;Notes of a Fringe Watcher&lt;/em&gt; column for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am sad that another of my  intellectual heroes is gone, I am glad that Martin Gardner led a full,  long, and by all accounts happy and fulfilling life. He has left behind a  tremendous legacy.

Scientists interested in the topic are accused of being part of a "geoengineering lobby" that wants to mess with the planet for fun and profit.

Alas, there's no evidence to support this idea. In fact, as recent Point of Inquiry guest Eli Kintisch reports over at CNN Money (clarification: the article is actually from Fortune, and CNN picked it up), government regulations so far have quashed those few attempts to profit off of geoengineering that have made it to the trial stage.

Kintisch's piece is called "Climate Hacking and Geoengineering: A Good Way to Go Broke."

&lt;p&gt;One of the candidates is &lt;strong&gt;Gordon Howie&lt;/strong&gt;, the Tea Party candidate.  He doesn’t have the most money, but he thinks he still has a fighting chance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of the five GOP candidates for governor, the two with all the money are Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard and Senate Majority Leader Dave Knudson. They’re the establishment candidates that Howie hopes to topple.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get support, what is Howie doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.howie2010.com/files/PR05142010.pdf"&gt;He’s telling churches to endorse him&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that would be illegal, since they are tax-exempt and are therefore not allowed to endorse one candidate over another… but Howie just ignores all that “Constitution” stuff: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“For too long, our spiritual leaders, have been neutralized in the public square,” Howie says. &lt;strong&gt;“Pastors and their congregations have been muzzled on Sunday mornings by the threat that their taxation status requires an enforced silence on who to vote for, and why. This is simply not true. Government regulation has no place behind the pulpit.“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our spiritual leaders, the men and women we trust most on matters of morality and responsible citizenry have every right to offer biblical guidance in helping their flocks align their spiritual values in choosing candidates who will return righteous rule to government,” Howie says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing the “Pulpit Initiative of 2008,” a faith-based challenge to perceived Internal Revenue Service authority to regulate politically-oriented speech from the pulpit, Howie has scheduled Sunday morning and Wednesday night appearances at church services across South Dakota, to expose the truth regarding ministerial freedom in political endorsement. Pastor Scott Craig, who participated in the original ‘Pulpit Challenge,’ publicly endorsed John McCain over Barack Obama in the 2008 election. He says a church’s tax status should not be allowed to serve as bribery in silencing their political message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The IRS basically tells churches, we will give you a financial kickback, if you give up your freedom of speech,” Craig says. “I was born an American citizen, guaranteed the right to freedom of speech. I didn’t give up my rights when I became a pastor.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Craig nor Howie understands the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches can endorse whomever they want — no one is stopping them — but in exchange, they have to pay taxes.  It’s as simple as that.  But you will never see churches jumping on that bandwagon.  Their deal right now is too sweet to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Craig can endorse whomever he wants in his capacity as a private citizen… but that changes when he steps into the pulpit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pastor has already listened to Howie and &lt;a href="http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_5b1845ec-65f5-11df-a5c6-001cc4c002e0.html"&gt;endorsed him in church&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On May 15, the Rev. H. Wayne Williams, pastor of Liberty Baptist Tabernacle in Rapid City, officially endorsed state Sen. Gordon Howie in his bid for governor during a church service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams did not return a message last week when called by the Journal, but few here expect that his church will face repercussions from the Internal Revenue Service as a result of his sermon. Federal tax code prohibits all tax-exempt organizations, including charities and churches, from endorsing any candidate for public office.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other pastors took a more responsible route:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Not from the Rev. Jeff Otterman, pastor of St. James Lutheran Church in Belle Fourche, however. He called Howie’s Pulpit Challenge irresponsible and insulting to his congregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The people at St. James are very well-read, and they don’t need their pastor telling them how to vote, or who to vote for,” Otterman said. “To back one candidate over another seems far-reaching and could alienate a congregation rather than create opportunity for growth.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Synagogue of the Hills, vice president Wayne Gilbert said its congregants hold divergent political opinions but all agree not to jeopardize the synagogue’s tax-exempt status over political activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think any responsible leader of a tax-exempt religious group would be willing to risk tax-exempt status to endorse a candidate,” Gilbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilbert said the idea “that I should be instructed by a religious leader as to which candidate has the moral or religious high ground is personally insulting to me. I expect religious leaders to offer me insight and guidance into spiritual and moral matters, not secular and political ones.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Howie’s own pastor has said he won’t endorse him from the pulpit because that’s an irresponsible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… “I have encouraged our people to be participants in the political arena and showed them the scriptures that back it up,” [Bishop Lorenzo] Kelly said. “But &lt;strong&gt;I have not from the pulpit endorsed him. I wouldn’t do that. I wouldn’t put my church in jeopardy of anything&lt;/strong&gt;.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howie is going to put every church out of business if they listen to him.  They’ll be rightfully sued by every church/state organization in the country.  The IRS will be all over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm… Maybe South Dakotans &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be voting for this guy.  He sounds like an anti-theists’ best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
