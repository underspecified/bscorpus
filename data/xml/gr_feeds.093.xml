&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader, if you are a wasp, do not attempt to nest in my house. You will only &lt;a href="http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;amp;newsitemID=8100"&gt;Release the Fucking Fury&lt;/a&gt;, said with a bad Swedish accent. I will plug your nest's entries and vacuum your workers as they return from foraging. Do not sting my chin, the only bit protruding from my raincoat. Do not nest in my house. That is all. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update next day:&lt;/b&gt; Dear Reader, if you are a mouse, do not attempt to forage for food &lt;a href="http://samarkeolog.blogspot.com/2009/07/clapton-security-measures.html"&gt;behind Samarkeolog's fridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/wasp_nest.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/pUKN5rDgvx8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248790695500"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=657">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a655c575bb84676f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Common CAM Media Myths</title><published>2009-07-28T14:08:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T14:08:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=657" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) – or what I think is best characterized as non-science-based medicine, is a common subject for the lay press. It’s counter-cultural, controversial, and can easily incorporate elements of fear and self-empowerment – all themes the media loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Articles on CAM often contain the same “facts”, whether quoted from some perceived expert or just asserted by the author, that in fact are wrong or grossly misleading. In an interview with the SGU, Christopher Hitchens commented that lazy journalists simply tell the story that is being told and then they build the “facts” around that story – rather than investigating to determine what the story actually is. This is very true in the world of CAM reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this &lt;a href="http://blog.syracuse.com/healthfitness/2009/07/more_americans_choosing_comple_1.html"&gt;recent article from syracuse.com&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, I will say right off that the author gets many things right. I am always pleasantly surprised to see reasonable comments in these pieces. Perhaps we are starting to get through. So let me start with some praise for those points I was happy to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key question shouldn’t be, ‘Is this a traditional medicine my insurance plan will pay for or it this complementary?’” said Dr. Lisa Kaufmann, a University Hospital internist. “The real question is, ‘Does it work?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is absolutely the real question – everything else is an elaborate diversion – the flourishes and exaggerated movements of a stage magician meant to distract the audience from his or her slight-of-hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, answering this question is often challenging, and proponents of treatments that do not work spend a great deal of time and effort trying to create the false impression that they do. But at least occasionally we can see the proper focus on the true question, does it work (and also, is it safe – or more accurately, do the benefits outweigh the risks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms such as “Western” medicine, “integrative” medicine, holistic, natural, etc. are all meaningless diversions from the real question that should concern a health care consumer – the safety and efficacy of the proposed intervention. (I say “real” and not “only” because questions of convenience and cost are legitimate, just separate from the question of effectiveness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also this gem from Kaufman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufmann said there’s a common misperception that all herbal medications are safe. “Herbs are quite often potent pharmaceuticals,” she said. Many of them have side effects and risks just like prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right – herbs are drugs. It’s as if Kaufmann has been &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=348"&gt;reading this blog&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, this is a reality that should be obvious to any medically trained person, so I hardly need to take credit for this realization. Kaufmann adds that patients should tell their physicians about their use of herbs and supplements. Very true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately that is where the goodness ends and the common CAM propaganda myths begin. The title of the article, in fact, is a bit of CAM propaganda – “More Americans choosing complementary or alternative medicines.” More than what? This is a mantra of the pro-CAM crowd (and reflects a social-norming strategy – basically peer-pressure), but it is not backed by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have discussed at length the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=203"&gt;National Health Interview Survey&lt;/a&gt; that shows that very few Americans are using hardcore CAM modalities – like acupuncture, homeopathy, and energy medicine – all in the single digits and not changing significantly. Like the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=95"&gt;false autism epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, that CAM usage is increasingly mainstream is an artifact of definition. If you include things like massage, prayer, taking vitamins, and exercising like yoga, then you can inflate the figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article quotes the highly inflated 40% figure for CAM use – but that figure is meaningless unless you define CAM, which has a slippery definition. By the most liberal definition anyone who has ever prayed for a sick love-one, apparently, has used CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also recommends the NCCAM as an objective source of information about CAM. It does not even mention that the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=341"&gt;NCCAM is controversial &lt;/a&gt;in scientific circles, and is actually a political creature, forced on the NIH &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=574"&gt;by senator Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt;. The NCCAM exists to promote CAM, and so far has wasted 2.5 billion dollars of taxpayer money without finding a single effective CAM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the false balance approach, the article next interviews a pro-CAM physician to balance the common sense of Dr. Kaufmann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest is growing in CAM because many people have become disillusioned with the way traditional medicine is practiced, said Dr. Scott Treatman, director of employee health services at Crouse Hospital. He teaches mindful living and stress reduction through SUNY Upstate Medical University and provides acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common assertion – but it is simply made up by CAM advocates for propaganda purposes – it is a self-serving assumption without a basis in fact. It is also a question that has been studied, although admittedly not much. But what data we do have tells the opposite story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9605899"&gt;1998 survey by Astin&lt;/a&gt; found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine did not predict use of alternative medicine. Only 4.4% of those surveyed reported relying primarily on alternative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18047447?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=3&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;more recent survey &lt;/a&gt;of CAM use in the elderly – chronic health problems, especially chronic pain, and a desire for control were correlated with CAM use. Dissatisfaction with mainstream medicine was not named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other surveys show the same thing – the profile of a CAM user is a person with disposable income who has a chronic painful condition and is ideologically aligned with a more spiritual approach to their health and desires a sense of control over their condition. Dissatisfaction with mainstream medicine does not appear to be a significant factor. But that is the answer I see reported in the media nearly 100% of the time (I cannot remember any counter examples, but I can’t rule them out by memory alone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just lazy reporting – 10 minutes on the internet reveals that what evidence there is does not support the dissatisfaction claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of CAM is completely artificial – it is a manufactured concept without a clear definition that is evolving into a modern myth propagated by a willing or just lazy media. The real story is that the public is being sold a bill of goods – a collection of treatments that are highly implausible and generally do not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach to marketing is not to market the product but to market something intangible – you’re not selling a car, you’re selling excitement or prestige, or even better – sex. CAM marketing often does not market the treatment itself – because the treatments are implausible and ineffective – they just don’t hold up to scientific scrutiny. So instead they market spirituality, control, and empowerment. And the people who want those things, buy it. They even use the common commercial ploys of the bandwagon phenomenon – everyone is doing it – and trumping up dissatisfaction with existing products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just like with that amazing new cleanser or incredibly absorbent towel, a savvy consumer should ask themselves about any specific “CAM” modality – does it really work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248790283780"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=1778">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/280b16083b240256</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="announcements"/><category term="consumer information"/><category term="BCA Libel case"/><category term="British Chiropractic Association"/><category term="chiropractic"/><category term="chiropractors"/><category term="Simon singh"/><category term="woo"/><title type="html">The Simon Singh article that caused all the fuss, reproduced here.</title><published>2009-07-28T14:03:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T14:03:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/07/29/the-simon-singh-article-that-caused-all-the-fuss-reproduced-here/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a worldwide campaign released today (29:07:09; 00:01 Aus EST ), The Guardian article originally posted by Simon Singh back in 2008, is to be republished across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edited version has the libelous sentence removed, but is reproduced to allow the public at large to understand the intentions of Simon’s original post. Given the current legal action currently in progress by the British Chiropractic Association against Simon, this provides insight into the claims for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spearheaded by Sense about Science, the intention of campaign is to alert the public to the potential implications  of libel or defamation as it pertains to free speech and journalism, not only in the UK but also across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the article produced in full, as approved by Simon and Sense about Science.&lt;br&gt;
—–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beware the spinal trap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some practitioners claim it is a cure-all, but the research suggests chiropractic therapy has mixed results – and can even be lethal, says Simon Singh&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to know that the founder of chiropractic therapy, Daniel David Palmer, wrote that “99% of all diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae”. In the 1860s, Palmer began to develop his theory that the spine was involved in almost every illness because the spinal cord connects the brain to the rest of the body. Therefore any misalignment could cause a problem in distant parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Palmer’s first chiropractic intervention supposedly cured a man who had been profoundly deaf for 17 years. His second treatment was equally strange, because he claimed that he treated a patient with heart trouble by correcting a displaced vertebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that modern chiropractors restrict themselves to treating back problems, but in fact some still possess quite wacky ideas. The fundamentalists argue that they can cure anything, including helping treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying – even though there is not a jot of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can confidently label these assertions as utter nonsense because I have co-authored a book about alternative medicine with the world’s first professor of complementary medicine, Edzard Ernst. He learned chiropractic techniques himself and used them as a doctor. This is when he began to see the need for some critical evaluation. Among other projects, he examined the evidence from 70 trials exploring the benefits of chiropractic therapy in conditions unrelated to the back. He found no evidence to suggest that chiropractors could treat any such conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about chiropractic in the context of treating back problems? Manipulating the spine can cure some problems, but results are mixed. To be fair, conventional approaches, such as physiotherapy, also struggle to treat back problems with any consistency. Nevertheless, conventional therapy is still preferable because of the serious dangers associated with chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, a systematic review of five studies revealed that roughly half of all chiropractic patients experience temporary adverse effects, such as pain, numbness, stiffness, dizziness and headaches. These are relatively minor effects, but the frequency is very high, and this has to be weighed against the limited benefit offered by chiropractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More worryingly, the hallmark technique of the chiropractor, known as high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust, carries much more significant risks. This involves pushing joints beyond their natural range of motion by applying a short, sharp force. Although this is a safe procedure for most patients, others can suffer dislocations and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still, manipulation of the neck can damage the vertebral arteries, which supply blood to the brain. So-called vertebral dissection can ultimately cut off the blood supply, which in turn can lead to a stroke and even death. Because there is usually a delay between the vertebral dissection and the blockage of blood to the brain, the link between chiropractic and strokes went unnoticed for many years. Recently, however, it has been possible to identify cases where spinal manipulation has certainly been the cause of vertebral dissection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie Mathiason was a 20-year-old Canadian waitress who visited a chiropractor 21 times between 1997 and 1998 to relieve her low-back pain. On her penultimate visit she complained of stiffness in her neck. That evening she began dropping plates at the restaurant, so she returned to the chiropractor. As the chiropractor manipulated her neck, Mathiason began to cry, her eyes started to roll, she foamed at the mouth and her body began to convulse. She was rushed to hospital, slipped into a coma and died three days later. At the inquest, the coroner declared: “Laurie died of a ruptured vertebral artery, which occurred in association with a chiropractic manipulation of the neck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is not unique. In Canada alone there have been several other women who have died after receiving chiropractic therapy, and Edzard Ernst has identified about 700 cases of serious complications among the medical literature. This should be a major concern for health officials, particularly as under-reporting will mean that the actual number of cases is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If spinal manipulation were a drug with such serious adverse effects and so little demonstrable benefit, then it would almost certainly have been taken off the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simon Singh is a science writer in London and the co-author, with Edzard Ernst, of Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial. This is an edited version of an article published in The Guardian for which Singh is being personally sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That's because Senator Harkin is undeniably the father of that misbegotten beast that has sucked down over &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/the_ap_shoots_and_scores_again.php"&gt;$2.5 billion of taxpayer money&lt;/a&gt; with nothing to show for it. It's also because NCCAM is the brainchild of Senator Harkin, who foisted it upon the National Institutes of Health not because there was a scientific need for it or because scientists and physicians cried out for it but rather because Senator Harkin, who believed that alternative medicine had healed a friend of his, wanted it, and he used his powerful position to make it happen, first as the Office of Unconventional Therapies, then as the Office of Alternative Medicine, and finally as the behemoth of woo that we know today as NCCAM. The result has included a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=554"&gt;$30 million trial of chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; in which convicted felons were listed among the investigators and a totally &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;unethical trial of the Gonzalez therapy&lt;/a&gt; for pancreatic cancer. It's not for naught that Wally Sampson called for the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;defunding of NCCAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/let_president-elect_obama_know_that_he_s.php"&gt;as have I&lt;/a&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Harkin has been most disturbed by the observation that NCCAM's trials have all been negative, going so far as to complain that NCCAM hasn't produced any positive results showing that various alternative therapies actually work. This is, of course, not a surprise, given that vast majority of the grab bag of unrelated (and sometimes theoretically mutually exclusive) therapies are based on pseudoscience. One of the only exceptions is the study of herbal remedies, which is a perfectly respectable branch of pharmacology known as pharmacognosy. Unfortunately, as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=402"&gt;David Kroll showed&lt;/a&gt;, in NCCAM the legitimate science of pharmacognosy has been hijacked for purposes of woo. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Senator Harkin hosted a hearing in which Drs. Dean Ornish, Andrew Weil, Mehment Oz, and Mark Hyman (he of "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=556"&gt;functional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=571"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;") were &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;invited to testify in front of the Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Add to that other powerful legislators, such as Representative Dan Burton (R-IN), trying to craft legislation in line with his anti-vaccine views and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/representative_dan_burton_trying_to_use.php"&gt;pressure the NIH&lt;/a&gt; to study various discredited hypotheses about vaccines and autism. Clearly, when it comes to quackery, there are powerful legislative forces promoting pseudoscience and studies driven by ideology rather than science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brought all this to mind are two very disturbing pieces of news that surfaced on Friday. They come from the opposite sides of the political spectrum. One--surprise! surprise!--involves Senator Harkin. The other involves a Republican. What they share in common is that they serve to illustrate how perilous for science-based medicine it can be when legislators try to insert their ideology into scientific studies and medical treatments funded by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkins_and_representative_d.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/senator_tom_harkins_and_representative_d.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_vtlnNxuzDw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248789487830"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/republicans_have_become_certif.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c98efd962d2a8d3f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Republicans have become certifiably insane</title><published>2009-07-28T14:17:33Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T14:17:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/4J0yozwhxFc/republicans_have_become_certif.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/republicans_have_become_certif.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, one of those routine, empty resolutions came up in congress: a Hawaiian representative brought up a nice fluffy little resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of Hawaii's statehood, which contained a collection of whereas's listing notable features of the state. Bland stuff, nothing controversial, except maybe one line, if you're a kook: one of the points of pride is that Hawaii has now contributed a native son to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a kook? Minnesota's own Michele Bachmann stood up to shoulder the honor. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/27/house-to-consider-counter_n_245741.html"&gt;She bravely blocked the vote&lt;/a&gt;. (The resolution has since been passed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could accept the occasional wacko, even if they do come from my own state, but it goes deeper than that. A huge chunk of the Republican contingent at the capitol is either buying into this 'birther' nonsense, or is so afraid of losing the far right wing vote that they won't speak out against it. This is a hilarious video of &lt;a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/07/27/mike-stark-on-capitol-hill-know-your-birthers/"&gt;Mike Stark interviewing Republican representatives&lt;/a&gt;, asking them if they believe Obama was a natural born citizen who could legitimately serve as president…and most of them dodge the question.&lt;/p&gt;

I love Mars pictures taken using the phenomenal HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and I love 3D images, so I — and therefore you — get a twofer today: a totally cool 3D view of a mesa on Mars, looking straight down on it from orbit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/media/images/PSP_008690_2075_PSP_007688_2075_RED.cutout.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3484/3729911271_e2baf060bd_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to embiggen.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you need red/blue glasses to make this work. If you don’t have any, I suggest you find some (lots of places sell them online), and then search this blog for the word &amp;quot;anaglyph&amp;quot;, which will make you very happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How cool is this? You can see that the top of the mesa is substantially above the rest of the surface, and the shallow depressions in the top are obvious… and, of course, provide us with a whimsical example of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/category/pareidolia/"&gt;pareidolia&lt;/a&gt;. The sand dunes rippling across even look a little bit like eyelashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, I love stuff like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find details about the picture &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007688_2075"&gt;on the HiRISE site&lt;/a&gt; as well as wider field of view pictures that put it into context. &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/anaglyph/"&gt;HiRISE has an incredible gallery of 3D anaglyphs&lt;/a&gt; that’ll keep you occupied for quite some time, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248789211085"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/28/sheril-role-model/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7269e46475a3fda4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Sheril, Role Model</title><published>2009-07-28T13:03:17Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T13:03:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/28/sheril-role-model/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again, I will embarrass my coauthor/coblogger: In a really amazing post &lt;a href="http://itsnotalecture.blogspot.com/2009/07/female-role-models.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, David Wescott provides a list of “female role models,” and guess who appears?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt;, 1595&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The interpretation, apparently, is that "like he doth grieve my heart" is a clause, introduced by &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; as a subordinating conjunction, roughly &amp;quot;And yet no man [doth grieve my heart] like he doth grieve my heart&amp;quot;. But under this analysis, it&amp;#39;s puzzling how &amp;quot;And yet no man&amp;quot; fits in — the ellipsis seems to be happening in the wrong clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So some of the commenters on my post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1599"&gt;Write like me&lt;/a&gt;" (7/24/2009) assumed instead that this is an example of prepositional &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; taking a nominative complement (= "And yet no man doth grieve my heart like him"), with the &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;-PP inserted between subject "no man" and verb "doth grieve". This makes syntactic sense, but it's morphologically odd (in fact, I think, impossible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others took it as conjunctive &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; allowing ellipsis of everything except the subject ("And yet no man doth grieve my heart like he [doth grieve my heart]), where &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; would work like &lt;em&gt;than&lt;/em&gt; in &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s taller than I [am tall]&amp;quot;. There&amp;#39;s a problem here with the order of clauses — thus Shakespeare writes things like &amp;quot;Windsor knows more of Anne&amp;#39;s mind than I do&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;you owed no more to time than I do now&amp;quot;, but never (as far as I can tell) places the &lt;em&gt;than&lt;/em&gt;-clause between the subject and verb of the main clause, e.g. "Windsor than I do knows more of Anne's mind", much less "Windsor than I knows more of Anne's mind". And the required full ellipsis with &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; strikes most if not all modern speakers as weird, and doesn't seem to have been common in Shakespeare's time either, if indeed it ever occurs elsewhere at all. But this seems to be the best of a set of problematic analyses, and it may be what the MWDEU editors had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether the context might help clarify what structure Shakepeare had in mind for this line, and so I took a look at this passage in several of the &lt;a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/facsimile/overview/play/Rom.html"&gt;fascimile editions&lt;/a&gt; available at the &lt;a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Foyer/about.html"&gt;Internet Shakespeare Editions&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to remind yourself of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet#Synopsis"&gt;plot&lt;/a&gt;. We're at the point in the play where Romeo has killed Juliet's cousin Tybalt and been banished from Verona. Juliet is beside herself crying over Romeo's situation. Her mother tries to comfort her, ignorant of the real reason for her grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the version from (the "bad") Quarto I, 1597, the interaction goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Moth:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I cannot blame thee.&lt;br&gt;
But it greeues thee more that Villaine liues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Iul:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What Villaine Madame?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Moth:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That Villaine Romeo.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Iul:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Villaine and he are manie miles a sunder.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Moth:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Content thee Girle, if I could finde a man&lt;br&gt;
I soone would send to Mantua where he is,&lt;br&gt;

As he should soone beare Tybalt companie.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Iul:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Finde you the meanes, and Ile finde such a man:&lt;br&gt;
For whilest he liues, my heart shall nere be light&lt;br&gt;
Till I behold him, dead is my poore heart.&lt;br&gt;
Thus for a Kinsman vext?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Moth:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Well let that passe.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of the play doesn't have the "like he" sentence, but I want to point something out about it anyhow: Juliet's responses are full of double meanings, both syntactic and semantic. Thus the alternate parses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For whilest he liues my heart shall nere be light till I behold him dead]&lt;br&gt;
[is my poore heart thus for a Kinsman vext?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For whilest he liues my heart shall nere be light till I behold him]&lt;br&gt;
[dead is my poore heart thus for a Kinsman vext?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "Villaine and he are manie miles a sunder" is open to two interpretations as well, depending on which direction you go in separating "Romeo" from "Villaine".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it's even more unclear how to collect her mother's clauses into syntactically coherent sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Content thee Girle, if I could finde a man&lt;br&gt;
I soone would send to Mantua where he is,&lt;br&gt;
That should bestow on him so sure a draught,&lt;br&gt;
As he should soone beare Tybalt companie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obvious what Lady Capulet means (that she would have Romeo poisoned if she could find an agent), but what&amp;#39;s the structure? Should we assume an omitted complementizer &amp;quot;if I could finde a man [that] I soone would send&amp;quot;, and interpret &amp;quot;that should bestow…&amp;quot; as the main clause, with &amp;quot;that [man]&amp;quot; as the subject, yielding the structure (in paraphrase)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[If I could find a man [whom I could immediately send to Mantua]] [that man would poison Romeo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or should we interpret &amp;quot;I soone would send…&amp;quot; as the main clause, with &amp;quot;that should bestow…&amp;quot; as a headless relative acting as the object of &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[If I could find a man] [I would immediately send to Mantua [someone who would poison Romeo]]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is it something else entirely?  None of these are grammatical in modern English. Maybe the structure as well as the meaning was obvious to Shakespeare&amp;#39;s audience — but I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the same interaction from Quarto 2, 1599, is longer, and this time the "like he" phrase appears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;La.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wel gyrle, thou weepst not so much for his death,&lt;br&gt;
As that the villaine liues which slaughterd him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Iu:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;What villaine Madam?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;La.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That same villaine Romeo.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Iu:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Villaine and he be many miles a sunder:&lt;br&gt;
God pardon, I do with all my heart:&lt;br&gt;
And yet no man like he, doth greeue my heart.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;La.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;That is because the Traytor murderer liues.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Iu:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I Madam from the reach of these my hands:&lt;br&gt;
Would none but I might venge my Cozens death.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;La.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We will haue vengeance for it, feare thou not.&lt;br&gt;
Then weepe no more, Ile send to one in Mantua,&lt;br&gt;
Where that same bannisht runnagate doth liue,&lt;br&gt;
Shall giue him such an vnaccustomd dram,&lt;br&gt;
That he shall soone keepe Tybalt companie:&lt;br&gt;
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;Iu:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Indeed I neuer shall be satisfied&lt;br&gt;
With Romeo, till I behold him. Dead&lt;br&gt;
Is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext:&lt;br&gt;
Madam if you could find out but a man&lt;br&gt;
To beare a poyson, I would temper it:&lt;br&gt;
That Romeo should vpon receit thereof,&lt;br&gt;
Soone sleepe in quiet. O how my heart abhors&lt;br&gt;
To heare him namde and cannot come to him,&lt;br&gt;
To wreake the loue I bore my Cozen,&lt;br&gt;
Vpon his body that hath slaughterd him.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here Juliet's ambiguity (one of many) is repeated in somewhat different words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Indeed I neuer shall be satisfied with Romeo till I behold him dead]&lt;br&gt;
[Is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;versus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Indeed I neuer shall be satisfied with Romeo till I behold him]&lt;br&gt;
[Dead is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lady Capulet's clauses, though different, still seem to be at least one complementizer short of a sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Then weepe no more, Ile send to one in Mantua,&lt;br&gt;
Where that same bannisht runnagate doth liue,&lt;br&gt;
Shall giue him such an vnaccustomd dram,&lt;br&gt;
That he shall soone keepe Tybalt companie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we have Juliet's "like he" phrase in context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Villaine and he be many miles a sunder:&lt;br&gt;
God pardon, I do with all my heart:&lt;br&gt;
And yet no man like he, doth greeue my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two lines might be an aside, not meant for her mother&amp;#39;s ears (though the first, again, is  ambiguous, as before). The third line, &amp;quot;And yet no man like he, doth greeve my heart&amp;quot;, is pragmatically ambiguous enough to serve her needs — does her heart grieve for Romeo the unpunished murderer or for Romeo the endangered lover? — but the syntactic structure is again unclear, as indicated at the start of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the context makes it worse, not better. The expression "God pardon __" is fairly common in Shakespeare, but always with an object. In modernized spelling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;… the unhappy king (whose wrongs in us God pardon) …&lt;br&gt;
… as both of you, God pardon it, have done …&lt;br&gt;
… God pardon all oaths that are broke to me …&lt;br&gt;
… God pardon them, that are the cause thereof …&lt;br&gt;
… God pardon sin, wast thou with Rosaline? …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would make sense (and a ten-syllable line) to add &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; after &amp;quot;pardon&amp;quot; — but the first Folio (1623) doesn&amp;#39;t, although it adds a comma and changes the spelling of a couple of  words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Villaine and he, be many Miles assunder:&lt;br&gt;
God pardon, I doe with all my heart:&lt;br&gt;
And yet no man like he, doth grieue my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there another way to fit these lines together? Not that I can see, at least without another cup of coffee. But the whole scene seems to be a collection of clausal shards that fit together in more than one way, or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether this is artistic intent, or scribal unreliability, or just the dislocation of linguistic distance. But in any case, I suggest that we leave Juliet out of the conjunctive&lt;em&gt; like &lt;/em&gt;controversy. The poor girl has her own troubles, linguistic as well as romantic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248786803278"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_365.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef2462c330fc88dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-28T09:02:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T09:02:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/FQU27Tk7o-c/clock_quotes_365.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_365.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There never was a child so lovely but his mother was glad to get him asleep. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some of it is deserved.  I don’t know the histories of these murderers, and I don’t know how religious they are and if they go to church on a regular basis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some commenters below note, people are told by pastors often that the Devil is real and that God exists and talks to us.  We’re taught to admire Abraham because he obeyed God when told to kill his son.  He would’ve gone through with it if God had not stopped him.  Is that different from what some of these parents are doing?  What makes Abraham sane and these women insane?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn’t say the church is responsible for the deaths in the stories referred to below.  Others are right in saying those women were insane, plain and simple, and religion not the problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am worried, though, that if people are taught to obey a god and fear a devil, and that is mixed with a spark of insanity, bad things could happen.  To me, neither is a good thing… but together, it’s a frightening combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for calling me out on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/category/babies/"&gt;baby thing&lt;/a&gt; is only funny because it’s all a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone does &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32171926/"&gt;indescribable things to a baby in real life&lt;/a&gt;, it’s horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone does it because she thought a devil told her to, it’s even scarier.  Partly because she wouldn’t have stopped at anything… You wonder how much further she would’ve gone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The scene was so gruesome investigators could barely speak: A 3 1/2-week-old boy lay dismembered in the bedroom of a single-story house, three of his tiny toes chewed off, his face torn away, his head severed and his brains ripped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers called to the home early Sunday found the boy’s mother, Otty Sanchez, sitting on the couch with a self-inflicted wound to her chest and her throat partially slashed, screaming “I killed my baby! I killed my baby!” police said. She told officers the devil made her do it, police said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez, 33, apparently ate the child’s brain and some other body parts before stabbing herself, McManus said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez had been “in and out” of a psych ward for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death is disturbing enough.  But when this article mentions other incidents where a mother killed her own children, you can see the common thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Andrea Yates drowned her five children in her Houston-area home 2001, saying &lt;strong&gt;she believed Satan was inside her and trying to save them from hell&lt;/strong&gt;. Her attorneys said she had been suffering from severe postpartum psychosis, and a jury found Yates not guilty by reason of insanity in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Dena Schlosser killed her 10-month-old in her Plano home by slicing off the baby’s arms. She was found not guilty of reason by insanity, after testifying that &lt;strong&gt;she killed the baby because she wanted to give her to God&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if this plays out in a similar way, Sanchez may also be found not guilty by reason of insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You kill your child directly because God or the Devil wants you to, and you’re not guilty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You kill your child &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/24/ava-worthingtons-parents-found-not-guilty-of-manslaughter/"&gt;indirectly&lt;/a&gt; because you think God will rescue her (Which is also insane to me, but not clinically so), and you’re also found not guilty.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if these cases could’ve been prevented, but at some point in their lives, these killers were told that God and the Devil speak to humans.  And if God tells you to do something, you’re supposed to follow it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not blaming the churches for this, but to paraphrase Voltaire, if you believe in absurdities, you’re likely to commit atrocities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In looking through the many comments, however, I see that most of what I would say has already been said by people who responded to my critics. Nevertheless…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why is it okay to mix science and religion (with atheists eagerly do in debunking religious claims) but not okay to mix science and politics/economics? Why is it okay for liberal atheists to stick it to religious believers and twist the knife slowly, but when it comes to getting your own (political/economic) beliefs challenged, that’s off limits — NOMA (nonoverlapping magisterial) for science and politics? I don’t see how they are different in principle. &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a science magazine, not an “atheist” magazine; nevertheless, we routinely deal with religious claims and no one ever complains about that. The closest we have come to political/economic issues is environmentalism (&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv09n2" title="This issue is sold out."&gt;Vol. 9, No. 2&lt;/a&gt; — sold out), overpopulation (&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv05n1" title="ORDER this back issue from skeptic.com"&gt;Vol. 5, No. 1&lt;/a&gt;), and global warming Vol. 14, No. 1). For all three we published several articles; in &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/magv14n1" title="ORDER this back issue from skeptic.com"&gt;Vol. 14, No. 1&lt;/a&gt;, for example, we published articles both skeptical of global warming and accepting of global warming. So I don’t see what would be wrong with publishing articles pro, con, and neutral on political and economic claims.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person wrote me a private email that said he thought of me as the next Carl Sagan, but now that I’ve gone to the dark side (turning Right, although I’m as critical of the Right as I am the Left), because Carl was “apolitical.” Carl Sagan was many things, but apolitical was not one of them. Carl was a Liberal and proudly wore his politics on his sleeve, such as when he marched in protest at nuclear sites or testified before Congress about the dangers of nuclear winter. I admire him for having the courage of his convictions, which intimately blended his science and (Left) politics. If you think Sagan was apolitical it is because you happen to agree with his politics and so those ideas seem simply correct, not political. If you don’t share his politics (I share about half of them), then it’s obvious that Sagan was not apolitical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liberal bias in the skeptical community was identified by many people in the comments section of my blog, for example by “DR,” “James,” and “Devil’s Advocate”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… Sadly, there is a lot of hatred toward libertarianism at JREF [he means TAM]. I can be an atheist, believe gay marriage is ok, think nothing of smoking pot, and I won’t get half as much grief from a conservative that I do from an American liberal who reels and squirms when I say that the welfare state is immoral or that free trade and voluntary transactions in capitalism promote fair and just outcomes. It’s like the only reason why I have rationalized this set of morality is because I’m a supremely evil person and must be wrong… —DR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… I’m disappointed, but not surprised by the large group of liberal skeptics. I’ve talked to too many Democrat-card-carrying skeptics that spout the same unoriginal, canned rhetoric and continual spewing hatred of Republicans. For a group that supposedly supports tolerance, they’re anything but tolerant …&lt;br&gt;
—James&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve three times over twenty years joined local skeptic groups and all three times there was a presumption that if I was a skeptic, then of course I’m also liberal in my politics. Two times I tried to be what I am but was marginalized, treated like a Goldwater (or Reagan, or Bush) mole. The third time I tried to avoid political discussion, but it was not possible, so, unwilling to lie, I left. My refusal to come over to pure liberalism clearly wasn’t going to be tolerated. All I wanted to do was examine UFO claims and crop circles, but… —Devil’s Advocate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another critic named John D. Draeger makes a good point that I wish to acknowledge: “He [me] does NOT believe that political persuasions and different economic models for how societies should be run are moral value judgements…. Social services can be paid for in different ways, and in a democratic society it’s up to the majority to define how that is done. Social services can be paid for in different ways, and in a democratic society it’s up to the majority to define how that is done.” That’s true, in a democracy the majority rules how to divvy up public funds for social services, and that tends to be more of a value judgment than a science. But as someone else wrote just below that, quite cleverly I think… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, democratic societies can still be evil, as the famous saying goes: “democracy is two wolves and one lamb voting on what to have for lunch.” And then in another famous quote (attributed to several), “A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. Thus our founding fathers gave us a republic … if we can keep it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this is a value judgment, I agree, but surely we can apply some forms of social science to inform our value judgments. For example, we may as a society make the value judgment that it would be good if every child received a basic K–12 education. I agree with this value judgment, and would add to it the value judgment that it would be equally important for every child to have a computer and Internet access because that is the future of education. So we share that value judgment. However, the next question is a pragmatic one: who is going to pay for this education (and computers/Internet)? Parents? Churches? NGOs? Charities? Government? If the latter — the value judgment we have made — then do parents get to choose among the various government schools of where to send their children? (No.) Do parents who choose to send their children to private schools have to also pay for government schools? (Yes.) Is that fair? You make that value judgment. I don’t think that it is fair. To be consistent, if you are pro-choice on abortion you should also be pro-choice on education. The deeper value judgment here is being pro-choice about everything. Choice = freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some correspondents hated the political diagram because it seems to elevate libertarianism above the traditional left-right spectrum. Okay, then you come up with something other than the left-right linear spectrum to visualize where someone would fall on that line who is socially liberal and fiscally conservative. You draw it and I’ll publish it in a future blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people hate the word “libertarian.” I’m not crazy about it either, but haven’t thought of a better label. Labels are useful because they enable people to take cognitive shortcuts, but they also lead to shortcuts to nuanced thinking about what someone believes. “Oh, you’re one of those…” full stop. We all do this, of course, but I call myself a libertarian for the same reason I call myself a feminist, an atheist, and a pro-choicer — because it is the accepted language and we have to communicate ideas with language. But I much prefer to be assessed on specific issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of you said that I am a victim of one of my own central tenets of baloney detection: the confirmation bias, where we look for and find confirmatory evidence for what we already believe and ignore the disconfirmatory evidence. Yes, I will admit, I do this. Everyone does, and we must guard against it, especially when it comes to religion, politics, and economics. To combat this problem, I read the conservative Wall Street Journal and the liberal Los Angeles Times. I listen to such conservative talk radio hosts as Hugh Hewitt and Dennis Praeger as well as the very liberal Bill Maher. I have read Karl Marx’s books as deeply and carefully as I have read Adam Smith’s books. I have read a host of books from liberal and conservative and libertarian authors on the current economic meltdown. And although I have a few libertarian and conservative friends, because I work in the sciences and in publishing, the vast majority of my friends, acquaintances, staff, co-workers, and colleagues are liberals who I can assure you are never shy about letting me know where they think I’ve gone off the political or economic rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me add that one of the appealing things to me about the libertarian worldview is that it is optimistic, uplifting, and most importantly (to me) anti-elitist. I’m in favor of doing whatever we can to allow the little guy to succeed and to break up power blocs that prevent the average Joe or Jane from reaching their full potential. The Constitutional divisions of power in our Democracy — emulated by many others around the world — are a huge improvement from centuries past that allowed or enabled some to succeed at the expense of others. That was a zero-sum world. Over the past 200 years the spread of democracy and capitalism has done more toward achieving a Nonzero world than anything else — more people in more places more of the time have more power and liberty and wealth than any time in the previous four millennium. Therefore, the more we can spread democracy and capitalism the better off more of us will be more of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

A study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and published in the most recent edition of &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; has found that autistic children are no more likely to have gastrointestinal problems than children who are not on the spectrum. The medical records of 100 autistic children over an 18-year period were compared to those of more than 200 children as controls. 77 percent of the autistic children had common GI problems (constipation, diarrhea, abdominal bloating, reflux, vomiting); 72 percent of the control group had these. Researchers did find that the autistic children were more likely to have constipation (34 percent to 17.6 percent) and to be &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/picky-picky/"&gt;picky eaters&lt;/a&gt; (24.5 percent to 16 percent). Only one autistic child had Crohn's disease and none had celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that "special diets"---in particular the gluten-free casein-free diet, which many families have placed their autistic children---are not warranted as treatments for autism. As noted in the July 27th &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/health/28autism.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, placing an autistic child on a restrictive child should only be done "after having appropriate diagnostic tests done." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm one of many parents who have placed their child on "the diet." In the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;early days&lt;/a&gt;, we swore by it and policed every drop of food that went into Charlie's mouth and into our house --- we had many bagel-free, pizza-free years as a result. (Jim and I agreed, if we were not letting Charlie eat something, we would not eat the "forbidden" food in his presence---fair's fair.) I &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; I saw changes in Charlie while on his food regimen, which overlapped with him starting an intense ABA home program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was it that, I saw the changes that I was so wanting to see? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Charlie got older, the diet became restrictive in more and more ways, namely, our vigilance about "NO cupcakes, not even a bite" at school parties for other students started to restrict Charlie socially. We gradually started him eating wheat; no big deal. Milk and other dairy products did seem to disagree with Charlie so we've still kept him off of those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Charlie was just diagnosed and everything was chaos and confusion, "doing the diet" made us feel that we were &lt;i&gt;doing something&lt;/i&gt;, that we were somehow contributing to helping Charlie as we waited to get evaluations done, searched for therapists, set up a home program. Whatever its actual merits as a treatment, putting on Charlie on the diet did have the positive side-effect of getting him to have to try new foods (when we started the diet, he mostly ate carbohydrates; some days, he'd only eat chocolate chip cookies). Our search for "ok foods" led us to introduce Charlie to many ethnic restaurants and to this day his favorites include Vietnamese summer rolls and &lt;i&gt;mien&lt;/i&gt; and sushi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the researchers' findings of more constipation and picky eating, I found some of the commentary in the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/health/28autism.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. [Samar] Ibrahim suggested that the loss of appetite and difficulty gaining weight in autistic children may be related to the use of stimulant medications, which are often prescribed for the condition, and that the constipation may be due to children not consuming enough fiber or drinking enough water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe, but not every child takes stimulant medications. There have been times when Charlie has limited himself to very few foods and, therefore, eaten very little; we've learned that his food choices are sometimes rooted in his sensory issues. As for constipation---some children may simply not want or be able to use just any bathroom (i.e., they may insist only on using a bathroom at home, versus one at school or in a store or restaurant), and this insistence can lead to some interesting scenarios. One thing I've learned time and again in trying to figure out why something or other is going on with Charlie that the most obvious answer isn't always the one that turns out to be right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248768439874"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=572">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f15b40e0a92a8061</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Acupuncture"/><category term="Book Review"/><category term="Medical Ethics"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="ineffective treatments"/><category term="Morgan Levy"/><category term="placebo effect"/><category term="Placebos"/><title type="html">Incorporating Placebos into Mainstream Medicine</title><published>2009-07-28T08:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T08:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=572" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alternative medicine by definition is medicine that has not been shown to work any better than placebo. Patients think they are helped by alternative medicine. Placebos, by definition, do “please” patients. We would all like to please our patients, but we don’t want to lie to them. Is there a compromise? Is there a way we can ethically elicit the same placebo response that alternative theorists elicit by telling their patients fairy tales about qi, subluxations, or the memory of water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist Morgan Levy has written a book entitled &lt;a href="http://www.morganlevymd.com/morganlevymd.com/placebomedicine/cover3.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Placebo Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. It’s available free online&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he makes an intriguing case for incorporating the best alternative medicine placebo treatments into mainstream medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a light, entertaining style, he covers the placebo effect, suggestibility, and the foibles of the human thought processes that allow us to believe a treatment works when it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thinking like a human” is not a logical way to think but it is not a stupid way to think either. You could say that our thinking is intelligently illogical. Millions of years of evolution did not result in humans that think like a computer. It is precisely because we think in an intelligently illogical way that our predecessors were able to survive… [by acting on quick assumptions rather than waiting for comprehensive, definitive data]… We have evolved to survive, not to play chess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He offers evidence from scientific studies indicating that belief in a treatment and the power of suggestion can have actual physiologic consequences such as production of endorphins or changes on brain imaging studies. He spices his narrative with colorful stories, including anecdotes from his own sex life and an impassioned plea (tongue in cheek?) for everyone to drink coffee for its proven benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives examples (10 each) of three groups of treatments that elicit the placebo effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Herbs and spices, (Bach’s flower remedies, Gingko, Echinacea, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
• Misused therapies (chelation, colonic irrigation, fish oil, etc.)&lt;br&gt;
• Totally fake treatments (acupuncture, homeopathy, ear candles, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains that some of these treatments do have real therapeutic effects, but they are being marketed for claims that are not the same as those real effects, or the real effects are too mild to support the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Placebo” is commonly thought of as a synonym for “ineffective” but it actually describes a therapeutic phenomenon that is very real and can be quite effective.&lt;br&gt;
The mechanism of action involves the way we think about therapy rather than any actual effect of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we told a patient:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sending you to a Placebo Medicine specialist who will administer magnetic therapy. This therapy will have no real physiologic effect. However, if you carefully follow the direction of the magno-therapist and fully buy into what he or she is saying, then your brain will produce endorphins that will relieve the pain in your elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might work even better if we used Levy’s suggested term “Non-Pharmacological Intervention” or NPI instead of using the word “placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could select patients by testing with suggestibility and psychosomatic instruments. We could tell the patient that he is fortunate because “Considering your scores on these scales you have a high probability of responding well to NPI treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if scientific medicine were to co-opt the CAM movement? We could take these treatments out of the hands of the less ethical practitioners and outright scam artists and place it in the hands of those who are more likely to be altruistic. The truly altruistic practitioners could work within official guidelines. The charlatans would no longer be able to paint conventional medicine as the enemy. Family doctors would get to use placebos again. It would be a win-win situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an acupuncturist is willing to use sham acupuncture and they don’t mind the patient being fully informed and they don’t cost too much, then I would gladly make referrals… I think that I could select an appropriate patient, perhaps one of my more somatic individuals, and educate them about the placebo effect. I would tell them how it can facilitate the brain to produce naturally occurring endorphins. I would refer patients for chronic idiopathic pain or for nausea and I would encourage them to fully buy into the story that the acupuncturist tells. I would say that the more they are able to do this the better it will work. Finally, I would follow the patient up afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely convinced, but I wonder if Dr. Levy might just be on to something. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

As usual, I doled them out in the kitchen: a few for Alex, and a few for me and Jeff. Then, the phone rang and while I was getting it Alex made off with my cookie. Jeff took off after him (Alex headed for his the privacy of his own room) to take back the cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re not going to believe what Alex just did,” Jeff said. “He held out the bowl to me — the &lt;em&gt;empty &lt;/em&gt;bowl with his right hand. With his other hand, he palmed the cookie and held it just out of sight, kind of but not completely behind his back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/empty-bowl.jpg" alt="empty bowl" width="480" height="360"&gt;We looked at each other, and we were both smiling. Because really. We all know all kids are liars and cheaters, at least some of the time. A friend of mine had a long, involved story about his 3-year-old son’s first lie that involved a car trip, a neighbor and some shoelaces or a baseball card (can’t quite remember). When Jeff told Ned he couldn’t do something and then asked me for an opinion (not realizing Ned had already gotten a “no” from me), Ned waved his arms wildly and said, “Don’t talk to Mommy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex has many talents but it’s always nice to have a reminder that inside that somewhat silent boy is a brain that’s calculating, ticking away, figuring things out. Even if it’s how to trick Mommy and Daddy.&lt;/p&gt;

Although unclear since $cientology arranged to have Jett cremated very, very quickly after his death, it’s possible the very anti-seizure medication $cientology convinced the Travolta’s to take Jett off of could have saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, so far there are no confirmed reports from the family that there’s any truth to these rumors. But if it’s true and John Travolta is considering leaving, the negative consequences of his departure will likely be great thanks to $cientology’s standard operating procedure to expose all the dirty, little secrets that their members were forced to confess to during the many, many hours of “auditing.” The cult keeps detailed records of these confessions so that they can use the information against those wanting to leave in order to blackmail them into staying in the cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But should John Travolta decide to leave, he won’t be on his own. A website has gone up calling on people to pledge to stand by him after he’s out, &lt;a href="http://itsokjohn.com/"&gt;It’s OK, John&lt;/a&gt; – we’ll back you, especially if you stand up and expose the cult for what it really is, helping to ensure $cientology can’t destroy any other lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I expressed my surprise and dismay that the Atheist Alliance International chose Bill Maher for the Richard Dawkins Award. I was dismayed because Maher has championed pseudoscience, including &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-bill-maher-really-that-ignorant_07.html"&gt;dangerous antivaccine nonsense&lt;/a&gt;, germ theory denialism complete with &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/03/idiot_week.html"&gt;repeating myths about Louis Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; supposedly recanting on his deathbed, a &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/12/bill-maher-anti-vax-wingnut.html"&gt;hostility towards “Western medicine”&lt;/a&gt; and an affinity for “alternative medicine,” a history of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/bill_maher_on_christine_maggiores_book.php"&gt;sympathy to HIV/AIDS denialists&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/bill_maher_antivaccination_wingnut.php"&gt;activities of PETA&lt;/a&gt; through his position on its board of directors, all facts that led me to liken his receiving the Richard Dawkins Award to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;giving an award for public health to Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. I was not alone, either. &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/richard-dawkins-award-goes-to-bill.html"&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheist-alliance-international-epic.html"&gt;Matt D.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/they-gave-bill-maher-the-richard-dawkins-award"&gt;Skepacabra&lt;/a&gt; agreed with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the beginning of Orac’s response to fellow atheist/science blogger Jason Rosenhouse’s defense of Bill Maher’s receiving of the Richard Dawkins Award:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason also virtually concedes that Maher is not really an atheist, waving it away by saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that he has some vague belief in a higher force in the universe hardly negates all of the good work that he is done in areas of relevance to the award. He has defintely raised awareness of the nontheist life stance through the media and the arts, and certainly helps teach acceptance of the nontheist lifestyle, just as the award describes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, but that’s only one criterion out of four, and fortunately Skeptico has already &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/07/bill_maher_is_a_fine_choice_fo.php#comment-1793993"&gt;addressed this argument&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, Jason appears to be conceding that, at best, Maher meets only 2/4 criteria, with 1/4 (science) an EPIC FAIL and the other 1/4 questionable at best. If Jason thinks that’s the only criterion that matters and is willing to ignore the rest, I guess there isn’t much more to say other than that, personally, when an award is given, I prefer that the recipient actually meet &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the listed criteria. (I’m funny that way.) The recipient doesn’t have to meet all of them equally and could even be a little shaky on one or two of them. But miss any one of them by so much that he might as well be on another planet? I don’t think so. As I’ve pointed out before, Maher’s views on medicine and science would have made him a perfect “victim” of one of Richard Dawkins’ deconstructions in part 2 of his BBC documentary &lt;em&gt;Enemies of Reason&lt;/em&gt;, right there with the homeopaths, crystal users, and various other woo believers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational person that Rosenhouse is, he did concede at least some points to Orac in the comments section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are also right that I really, really like Bill Maher and do not like to see him criticized so harshly for what I take to be an annoying side note to an otherwise solid body of work. Perhaps this biases me in his favor. On the other hand, perhaps the fact that the issues on which he is bad are precisely the ones you care most about biases you against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he concedes that he’s probably defending Maher more because of personal bias. Fair enough. Before a week ago, I too was in denial of how anti-medicine Maher was. Of course, I changed my mind when presented with more evidence. Also, while he concedes to being a bit biased, it’s bullshit to accuse Orac of being biased against Maher’s anti-medical position, something Orac himself calls Rosenhouse on in a later comment. To downplay this by suggesting an anti-medical position is just Orac’s pet issue because he’s a doctor is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JREF Communication Manager &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Wagg&lt;/strong&gt; went to Denny’s recently where &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/650-dennys-discount-discriminiation.html"&gt;he saw the following flyer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/dennysflyer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dennys" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/dennysflyer.jpg" title="Dennys" width="341" height="541"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time something like this has happened.  I mentioned &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/06/27/atheists-pay-full-price-at-restaurant-while-churchgoers-get-discount/"&gt;a similar incident&lt;/a&gt; on this site a couple years ago — that one also took place in Euless, Texas — and Wagg has a list of &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/650-dennys-discount-discriminiation.html"&gt;several other incidents&lt;/a&gt; where non-churchgoers were discriminated against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/650-dennys-discount-discriminiation.html"&gt;Jeff’s account of the story here&lt;/a&gt;.  The restaurant said this was a corporate policy and Jeff has sent headquarters a polite letter of complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone would like to call the corporate offices in the morning, their number is 1-800-733-6697.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if Christians could step up and call, too.  Even if the policy benefits you, it’s not right and it’s still discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I wonder why Christians are getting the 10% savings when some of them &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/30/dont-serve-the-christians-on-a-sunday/"&gt;don’t even tip on Sundays&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

I love that I’m able to use and hear the word &lt;b&gt;cleavage&lt;/b&gt; regularly in my work. I mean, wouldn’t you be fired or at least put on probation for excessive use of the word &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;in many lines of work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m in the field, I use the word &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;at least daily– probably closer to hourly. When I’m working on mineral separates, I use the word &lt;b&gt;cleavage&lt;/b&gt; much more often than that. Maybe even a few times a minute, depending on the topic of conversation. I want to thank the geologist(s) who decided to use this word to describe not just one but &lt;b&gt;TWO&lt;/b&gt; geological properties. This doubles the numbers of opportunities in which I (and other geologists or people talking about geology) can use the word &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt; as part of a technical, no-nonsense, completely work appropriate conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I must admit that I have become somewhat jaded by my frequent use of the word &lt;b&gt;cleavage&lt;/b&gt;. When I first heard the geologic use of the word in a high school science class, I snickered along with the rest of the class. I found the term hilarious, especially because the teacher and class kept using the word. These days, I often use the word without even noticing. On second thought, I’m not &lt;em&gt;completely &lt;/em&gt;jaded. &lt;b&gt;Cleavage &lt;/b&gt;is still funny… just as orogeny and schist are still funny. Being a geologist is fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my New Penguin Dictionary of Geology (First Edition, 1996), &lt;b&gt;cleavage&lt;/b&gt; has two geologic definitions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“1. A mineral property whereby it breaks along regular, crystallographic planes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.rocksforkids.com/images/Feldspar%20Rhombohedron%201.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For instance, cleavage planes are visible in this picture of calcite I poached from google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“2. A foliation formed by deformation at low metamorphic grade, along which rock splits preferentially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.uct.ac.za/depts/geolsci/dlr/laingsburg/Aut_2521.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For example, in this picture of an outcrop I also poached from google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a word of advice, when looking for photos of geologic &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;on google, be use to use search terms such as “&lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;mineral” or “&lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;geology.” Don’t just search google images for “&lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;.” Trust me, it will be a long time before an image of mineral &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;shows up. Page nine, actually, for my search. Interestingly, an image of boob &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;shows up on page two when you google image search “&lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;geology.” Try it. Intriguing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking a fair amount about &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;- the mineral kind- today, actually. I spent most of this afternoon working on a pyroxene mineral separate from one of my peridotite rocks from Oman. I sawed, crushed, and sieved the sample last week. I also used a franz (a magnetic separator) to obtain several different magnetic fractions. Since pyroxene is less-magnetic than some of the other minerals (oxides, olivine, serpentine) and more magnetic than some (carbonate) in my partially-altered peridotite, magentic separation is a good technique for separating out pyroxene. After magnetic separation, hand picking with tweezers under a microscope is necessary to ensure that there is really a pure fraction. When using the magnetic separator, some grains can jump into the wrong container. Also, bimodal and altered grains that are not pure pyroxene may end up in the pyroxene fraction. Magnetic separation basically just reduces the amount of time you need to spend picking out pyroxenes– but hours of picking are still necessary, at least for the samples I’m working on now. One of the ways I’m able to identify the precious pyroxenes is by their distinctive cleavage– when I crushed the rock, the pyroxenes fractured in a distinctive manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, a researcher with whom I’m working looked at some of the pyroxenes with me to help me identify them in my separate. Here’s a snippet of our conversation. I’ve fictionalized the conversation somewhat as I don’t remember the exact wording, but this is fairly close to the actual conversation. To maintain anonymity, I will refer to the researcher as Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;. Just, you know, so I can type the word &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;a few more times.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Evelyn walks into Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;’s office, balancing a tray of mineral fractions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn: Hey, Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh– hi, Evelyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn: Is this a good time? I can come back later if you’re busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;: No, no. Just checking email. How are those mineral separates going? Looks as if you have a few fractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn: Yes. Would you like to take a look? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;: Is there any good &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn: Yeah, there’s some great &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you want look under the microscope?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;: Sure. Let’s see if we can tell apart the pyroxene &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;and the serpentine &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evelyn and Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;walk over to the microscope and pour out some mineral grains on a sheet of weighing paper. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn: I think the &lt;strong&gt;cleavages &lt;/strong&gt;look somewhat similar, but the orthopyroxenes have a distinctive yellow color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cleavage: Yes, color is probably most distinctive. But do you see the sharper &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;in some of these pyroxenes? The serpentine &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;is more rounded. Serpentine doesn’t have strong &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn: I think so. Are those green ones you’ve set aside clinopyroxene?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cleavage: I believe so– take a look at the &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes… yes, the &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;is definitely pyroxene. Looks as if you’ll have two pyroxene fractions. That’s great! See how helpful &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;is?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea… so, how about the skepchick readers? What’s your best (geologic) sentence containing the word &lt;strong&gt;cleavage&lt;/strong&gt;? Better yet, a challenge: use the word &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;at work or school in the near future. Try using it a vague sentence such as “Wow, I saw some great &lt;strong&gt;cleavage &lt;/strong&gt;this weekend.” When your co-worker or classmate looks shocked, continue: “Yeah, I was at this rock and mineral show…” Let me know how it turns out. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248758109841"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1510">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/492891843c042609</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Challenges to Science"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="CSIRO"/><category term="Daria"/><category term="educational"/><category term="ESP"/><category term="Facebook"/><category term="fashion"/><category term="feminism"/><category term="geek"/><category term="glasses"/><category term="intellectual"/><category term="podblack"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="psychic"/><category term="Quirkology"/><category term="Scientific American"/><category term="sex"/><category term="sexy"/><category term="skeptic"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="specs"/><category term="television"/><category term="Veronica Mars"/><category term="Weird Al"/><category term="women"/><title type="html">Retrospectacle: Looking Good - Scientifically</title><published>2009-07-28T01:35:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T01:35:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/gXc6eHRdxwE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1510"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">What is Retrospectacle?

I'm trying to nab an interview with either Shane Acker or writer Pamela Pettler to explore these issues further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/07/solve_the_puzzle_win_a_pair_of.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/07/solve_the_puzzle_win_a_pair_of.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248744910360"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14273">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7077b9d7c8d96c4f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Why Does Billy Graham Have a Column?</title><published>2009-07-28T01:00:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T01:00:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/27/why-does-billy-graham-have-a-column/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really would like to know why &lt;strong&gt;Rev. Billy Graham&lt;/strong&gt; has a syndicated column.  &lt;a href="http://newsok.com/billy-graham/article/3387794"&gt;In his latest one&lt;/a&gt;, he spends most of the time talking about something that has nothing to do with the letter-writer’s question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is actually a good one: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;My 7-year-old son asked me to ask you this question: Do you think there’s intelligent life on other planets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the Bible say anything about this? My son is very curious about things such as this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham answers this in the first couple sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Bible doesn’t say anything about life on other planets; its focus is on this planet and its need for God. There well may be life on other planets, but the Bible doesn’t say one way or the other.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it matters what the Bible says on this issue anyway… it didn’t have anything to say about DNA or HIV, either, but science has plenty to to say on those subjects.  Why not place some trust in the process that produces results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Graham then spends another four paragraphs preaching about anything and everything and nothing all at once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What the Bible does say about the universe, however, is very important, and I hope you’ll teach it to your son. It’s found in the first verse of the Bible, and it tells us everything in the universe was made by God: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). The galaxies and the stars and the planets didn’t happen by accident; they came into existence because God made them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be thankful for your son’s curiosity and ask God to help you use it to point him to Jesus…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the lady’s son is genuinely interested in finding out whether or not there is life on other planets, asking God for help won’t get him any closer to the answer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading a science book that discusses which environments could be hospitable to life may help.  Or a book on the universe.  Or a book that discusses what we need to look for, exactly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what would happen to Graham’s faith if we ever did find evolved life on another planet, though.  (And what if those beings didn’t believe in Jesus?!)  Would we still be considered special?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Jason&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

(Maybe not even most?  I honestly don’t know the breakdown.)  But people who do work at colleges and universities sometimes talk as if that’s all there is, or that becoming a professor is the only logical goal for those pursuing a scientific degree — not necessarily from snootiness or elitism, but just because that’s what they know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s great that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/jobs/pnas/"&gt;Chad Orzel has done a series of short interviews with scientists outside academia&lt;/a&gt;, and is gradually blogging the results.  It’s a nice little bit of informal sociology of the field, and a useful resource for anyone who might be contemplating such a career path themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chad, as you probably know, has also &lt;a href="http://dogphysics.com/"&gt;written a book that will be coming out later this year&lt;/a&gt;.  And he’s supposed to be doing scientific research, and keeps up an active blog!

It may be fair to expand the scope of usefulness to Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), prompts, and the autistic spectrum in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PDA with calendar, tasks, and reminder capabilities can be great for those of us with little sense of time.  Many organizational programs have graphical capabilities for people who don't resonate well with numbers or words.  Notes, tasks, and reminders also can also substitute for short term memory.  The awesomeness of PDAs with a built in GPS is invaluable for those of us with a tendency to confuse easily, especially in new places.  PDAs that take pictures can help with memory, navigation, orienting in new places, all sorts of things.  And PDA applications with favorite sights, sounds, and games can soothe the nerves.  Best of all for anyone with executive function issues is that there is only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; does-it-all device to keep track of, not a ton of separate calendars, notebooks, devices, etc. to lose, forget about, and curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long-time PDA user (as soon as they became marginally affordable over a decade ago), I am quite serious when I tell people my executive function skills are present not in my brain, but in my PDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious point here is that a PDA can be an invaluable piece of assistive technology for autism-specific "stuff."  Plus, PDAs are mainstream, even "cool," so there's no weird looks for using one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less obvious point is that it can be beneficial to think about what sort of tool can give a person a skill they don't otherwise have, rather than pouring energy into trying to find a way to make that person have the skill unassisted.  What actually works is more important than appearances.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248738642767"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=872">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fdb25b0a95b4d040</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="ask an angel"/><category term="dating"/><category term="endogamy"/><category term="exogamy"/><category term="judaism"/><title type="html">Ask an Angel (of Death)</title><published>2009-07-27T23:05:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T23:05:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/07/27/ask-an-angel-of-death/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at Jewish Journal they’ve introduced &lt;a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/askanangel/"&gt;Ask an Angel&lt;/a&gt;, a light-hearted look at the dating scene from the perspective of a 40-something single Jewish mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of today’s hilarious posts she describes how she’ll &lt;a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/askanangel/item/dont_break_your_mammas_heart_39090727/"&gt;kill her son&lt;/a&gt; if he someday marries a non-Jewish girl:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Here’s the thing, I like being with a Jew and think it’s important to show the value of a shared religion to my son as he starts dating.  It’s a deal breaker for me and God willing will be a deal breaker for my son.  By deal breaker for my son, I mean I will kill him if he puts my Grandmother’s ring on a finger that is attached to a girl who is not Jewish.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as a 13-year-old, her son &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah"&gt;theologically&lt;/a&gt; an adult, and therefore I suspect that he’s mature enough not to find his mother’s internet death threats even slightly traumatic.  In fact, I bet he’s laughing about them right now, unless maybe he’s too busy laughing about her threats to force him to repay all the money she’s spent on his religious education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the rest of her post is a meditation on the appeal of non-Jewish women.  I left a comment suggesting that part of the appeal might be that they tend not to threaten their kids with death for marrying non-Jews, but someone seems to have deleted it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248738628250"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14281">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/060b38431f65d0c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Bus Ads"/><category term="General"/><category term="Lawsuits"/><title type="html">Indiana Atheists Win Lawsuit Over Bus Ads</title><published>2009-07-27T23:40:57Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T23:40:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/27/indiana-atheists-win-lawsuit-over-bus-ads/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some good news from the Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, atheists paid to have &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/14/atheist-bus-ads-in-south-bend-hit-snag/"&gt;this ad&lt;/a&gt; put on buses in Bloomington, Indiana:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/goodgod1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/goodgod1.jpg" alt="goodgod1" title="goodgod1" width="480" height="205"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After paying for it, Transpo (the bus company) decided the ad was “too controversial” and never placed the ad on buses.  A lawsuit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the &lt;a href="http://inatheistbus.org/2009/07/27/campaign-prevails-against-bt-in-free-speech-lawsuit/"&gt;atheists have prevailed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The members of the campaign are pleased to announce that we have reached a settlement with Bloomington Transit regarding our lawsuit.  A preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana, but Bloomington Transit capitulated in the days leading up to the injunction hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms of the settlement are that BT will accept our ad, which features the slogan ‘You Can Be Good Without God’ for posting on as many buses and for as long of a time as we like, for the standard ad rate.  They will also be reimbursing the ACLU of Indiana for a significant portion of their legal expenses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is wonderful news, a precedent judges can look to in case this happens again elsewhere, and a victory for free speech advocates everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; (UK), Travolta is still distraught over his son’s death.  That &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25840319-2,00.html"&gt;death may be attributed&lt;/a&gt; to the Church of Scientology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He reportedly resents going along with Scientology’s prescribed treatment for [son] Jett’s condition.  The church does not recognise autism as genuine, but instead believes it to be merely psychosomatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church recommends treatment with vitamins and a detox program, not prescription medicines.  It is also reported that the church’s response to the teenager’s death has been to conduct “intensive sessions” with so-called ethics officers, whose job is to question Travolta and other family members to determine if their “negative influences” caused the tragedy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had he consulted real doctors who know real science, perhaps the death could have been prevented.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no different from Christian faith-healing parents who &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/24/ava-worthingtons-parents-found-not-guilty-of-manslaughter/"&gt;refuse to provide proper care&lt;/a&gt; for their children, hoping that God will just magically take care of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travolta is now considering leaving the church.  Why any hesitation?  If he leaves, they may “&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1202077/Is-John-Travolta-cracking-Its-just-grief--guilt--dead-son-tearing-actors-apart.html"&gt;reveal his secrets&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His distress, say sources close to him, has been compounded by the first cracks in his 34-year relationship with the Church of Scientology, the cult-like religion of which Travolta is a prominent and generous benefactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are dark mutterings that if he carries out private threats to leave, the organisation will go public with embarrassing details of his private life, including, it is claimed, allegations of past homosexual relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man who starred in &lt;em&gt;Grease&lt;/em&gt; is afraid people may find out he’s gay?  That would be… what’s the opposite of “shocking”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;strong&gt;PhillyChief&lt;/strong&gt; already pointed out the obvious with &lt;a href="http://youmademesayit.blogspot.com/2009/07/whats-more-embarrassing-than-being.html"&gt;his headline&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What’s more embarrassing than being a Scientologist?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Travolta leaves, it’d be bad for Scientology, good for Travolta, and even better for people who might also come to their senses and not join the cult.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travolta probably doesn’t need to worry about his reputation being harmed if “secrets” come out.  If he actively spoke out against the Church, I would think his reputation would skyrocket.  If he told the truth, people would listen.  He’d get more positive press for leaving the church than he will while remaining in limbo with them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great. Mike Stark tracks down Republicans in DC and asks them about &lt;a style="background-color:transparent;color:#003399;text-decoration:none;margin:0;padding:0" href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/07/27/mike-stark-on-capitol-hill-know-your-birthers/"&gt;the birther issue&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/john-cole-on-birthers-and-republicans/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g1o1p_ly7Yw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Republicans in DC are running from some guy on the street asking them whether or not Obama is an American citizen is because &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they have spent the last thirty years cultivating a base of insane crazy people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;[emphasis mine]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and while they may escape a reporter from &lt;span style="background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:.9em;letter-spacing:.07em;border:initial none initial;margin:0;padding:0"&gt;FDL&lt;/span&gt;, they can’t escape the base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don’t like the whole ambush journalism thing, I don’t think it’s fair to the people being ambushed and I’d personally rather hear from people who are prepared and can make the best argument they can.  However, I do think this video highlights exactly what John Cole is talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the stupidest conspiracy theories I’ve heard.  Rarely, at least, is it so easy to provide evidence against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course that’s undoubtedly been forged/photoshopped/omg the number is redacted it’s a fake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Despite the popularity of abstinence-only meal programs in schools across the country, the study found that children who were provided with no food at lunch and cautioned against eating at an early age were no less likely to become overweight than those who were provided with a well-rounded nutritional education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no evidence to suggest that instructing teens not to chew, swallow, or even think about food is actually going to stop them from eating,” Sebelius told reporters. “Let’s face it: Kids are already eating. And not only during lunchtime. They’re eating after school, at the mall, in their parents’ basements. Pretending like it’s not happening isn’t going to make it go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After all, they’re teenagers,” Sebelius continued. “Eating is practically the only thing on their minds.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started eating at a really young age.  It’s rare that I go a day without eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I eat too much.  I even go back for seconds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some foods I won’t eat, of course… because I don’t swing that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do eat, please remember to use condiments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice safe snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok.  I’m done now.  You can take it from here.&lt;br&gt;

10-year-Ben Kredich, who's on the spectrum, swims the 25-yard freestyle in the Greater Knoxville Area Interclub Swimming Association City Championship Meet, the July 26th&lt;a href="http://www.govolsxtra.com/news/2009/jul/26/one-stroke-one-milestone-at-a-time/?partner=RSS"&gt;Go Vols Extra&lt;/a&gt; reports. And 18-year-old Robbie Phillips, who's also on the spectrum, competed in yesterday's ninth annual &lt;a href="http://www.silive.com/prnewswire/index.ssf?/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=SIlive.story&amp;amp;STORY=/www/story/07-26-2009/0005066167&amp;amp;EDATE=Jul+26,+2009"&gt;Nautica New York City Triathlon&lt;/a&gt;, as noted the July 26th &lt;a href="http://www.ocala.com/article/20090726/ARTICLES/907261008/0/obiz"&gt;Ocala.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought: Charlie's two-thirds ready for a triathlon. He can bike 12 miles at least and, if needed, he could swim as long as he had to. He just has to learn to run like Robbie and &lt;a href="http://therunman.blogspot.com/"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; (Charlie can certainly run, but not in any organized or competitive setting). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second thought is, while avidly cheering on Ben and Robbie for their accomplishments, I'm mindful of a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/music_interests_and_questions_coast_to_coast"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; by Dora: Is the only reason their achievements were reported because they're on the spectrum and the news stories therefore have that heartwarming edge? "Why should it come as a surprise that autistic kids, like any other kids, benefit hugely from doing stuff they like and are good at?," as Dora wrote; why should it be a surprise that autistic kids (and individuals on the spectrum) can achieve in athletic events, and otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248732102958"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_re.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1d4d4569b2bab99f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><title type="html">2012: The Real "Milestone", The Real Danger</title><published>2009-07-28T01:34:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T01:34:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_re.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone/doomsday1.jpg" width="500" alt="doomsday1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doomsday in 2012?  Please, I don't even have time for that.  (Check out &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/05/19/no-doomsday-in-2012/"&gt;Ian O'Neill's work&lt;/a&gt; for a nail-in-the-coffin of those myths.)  But there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a big milestone that we will reach right around 2012.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_re/Earth_Moon_atmosphere.jpg" width="500" alt="Earth_Moon_atmosphere.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the industrial revolution, the Earth's atmosphere was really ideal for supporting the wide diversity of life on the planet.  Breaking it up into its physical, molecular contents, the atmosphere, weighing in at just over &lt;b&gt;5,100 trillion tonnes&lt;/b&gt; (5.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms), was made up of the following elements (by &lt;i&gt;mass&lt;/i&gt;, not &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_chemistry#Atmospheric_composition"&gt;volume&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nitrogen gas&lt;/b&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): 3,890 trillion tonnes (around 75.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oxygen gas&lt;/b&gt; (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): 1,190 trillion tonnes (around 23.1%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Argon gas&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monatomic"&gt;monatomic&lt;/a&gt;): 66 trillion tonnes (around 1.3%), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carbon Dioxide&lt;/b&gt; (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): 2.18 trillion tonnes (about 0.04%),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
plus a variable amount of water vapor.  But the amount of these gases in the atmosphere didn't really change very much over the past few thousand years, while human civilization developed, grew, and thrived.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, right around the year 1800, something new happened.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_re/industrial-revolution.jpg" width="500" alt="industrial-revolution.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industrial revolution!  It brought great things with it, things that helped give us the world we have today.  And it brought along with it one small, unforeseen consequence: every &lt;b&gt;atom of carbon&lt;/b&gt; that we burned combined with oxygen in the atmosphere, &lt;b&gt;artificially producing 
carbon dioxide&lt;/b&gt; in copious quantities for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn't really a big deal at the beginning, because the amount of carbon dioxide we were producing was &lt;i&gt;tiny&lt;/i&gt; compared to the amount that was already there.  But over the past 200 years, our energy needs have gone up, and the way we've met them is -- nearly universally -- through the burning of carbon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_real_danger/coal-power-plant.jpg" width="500" alt="coal-power-plant.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1870, the world was artificially producing &lt;b&gt;a billion tonnes&lt;/b&gt; of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1920, it was &lt;b&gt;5 billion&lt;/b&gt; a year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1960, we'd hit &lt;b&gt;10 billion&lt;/b&gt; a year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1980s, we were up past &lt;b&gt;20 billion tonnes&lt;/b&gt; each and every year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, at present, we're nearly up to &lt;b&gt;30 billion tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; emitted annually.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_real_danger/fig1.png" width="500" alt="fig1.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of this nearly 30 billion tonnes per year, the United States is responsible for about 6 billion tonnes of it.  And over 98% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that we emit comes from the production of energy in one form or another.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_real_danger/fig%203.png" width="500" alt="fig 3.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you add this all up (and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/how_could_we_affect_the_earth.php"&gt;I did a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;), you find that humanity is on pace to have added &lt;b&gt;1.5 trillion extra tonnes of Carbon Dioxide&lt;/b&gt; by 2012!  How's that for a milestone?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If -- as a world -- we don't cut our Carbon Dioxide production significantly, by 2030 we will have added as much Carbon Dioxide to the atmosphere &lt;i&gt;as there was Carbon Dioxide &lt;b&gt;in&lt;/b&gt; the atmosphere&lt;/i&gt; when we started!  The world isn't going to end in 2012; it isn't even going to end in 2030.  But if we don't do something to stop making this mess that we're continuing to make, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you've got the facts now.  What do you think we should do about it?  And how can we make it happen?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/2012_the_real_milestone_the_re.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248731429477"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/two-new-reviews/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f73d28ab23442b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><category term="at the interSeCtion"/><title type="html">Two New Reviews</title><published>2009-07-27T20:51:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T20:51:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/two-new-reviews/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I’ve written before, it’s terrific to see others weighing the pros and cons of the arguments laid out in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/"&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

Yes, but they were right to open it part-time to save money.

No, they need to close whatever keeps them financially sound.

&lt;p&gt;There has been no actual statement from the family and other than the golf cart reports and the spotting of a bloated Travolta eating junk food. We haven’t heard a word from the family. Still, speculation runs wild. The main rumor is that a distraught Mr.Travolta may be leaving the church based on Scientology’s denial of autism and mental illness. Travolta’s dead son, Jett, was taken off his anti-seizure medication just prior to his death and Scientology refuses to acknowledge autism as an actual illness. In fact, Scientology considers all mental illness to be psychosomatic and is forcefully against any kind of medication for mental illness. One could understand how this could cause a grieving parent to reconsider the teachings of a church that in this case, could quite possibly have done more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If indeed John is considering leaving the church, he will have to face &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5490"&gt;the vicious backlash&lt;/a&gt; that is known to be standard operating procedure of Scientology. All members of the church go through continual auditing. Auditing is Scientology’s version of confession, and unlike other churches who consider confession to be private exchange between a priest and a God and the confessor, Scientology keeps detailed files on the confessions of the people being audited so that they may use that information against the person to rope them in should they attempt to leave the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update if any new information comes out and until then a site has been set up so that we can show our support to Mr. Travolta should he decide to leave the church. I for one wish him and his family the best and stand by him should he choose to leave. You can show your virtual support by clicking on the link below.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does an atheist turn when she finds herself surrounded by people yet always alone? I live in a fairly conservative part of the country and while my friends know and accept that I’m an atheist, they view it as more of a novelty than anything — something they like to bring up when there are new people around, or if they have had a few drinks and feel like debating someone. Like it’s fun to wind me up and watch me go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to take the bait, but sometimes I can’t help myself. See, no one is interested in just talking to me and learning about my opinions or beliefs. They think that I turn too aggressive (who among us doesn’t come across that way?). I am a thirty-something mother of a beautiful little girl, I take good care of myself physically and lead an active lifestyle, I am a happy person, slow to anger, and while I am more liberal than most in my community, I don’t push my views on anyone else. I also don’t bring up my atheism unless someone asks (I learned that lesson very early on) and yet somehow, when the topic of religion comes up, I’m aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire to talk and learn and share my ideas about religion and atheism is very strong. However, since I have no one to talk with or share ideas with here, I find my only option is to turn to the internet. It’s been wonderful and I have learned so much (thanks Hemant, PZ, and Daniel to name a few), but still, it’s a little lonely. I wish there were a local atheist organization I could join, but the closest one is hundreds of miles away (although I’ve considered making the drive many times). I plan on going to the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/"&gt;Atheist Convention&lt;/a&gt; in Burbank in October, but when I told my husband and friends about it, they laughed and kinda ribbed me like it was cute or something. I hate this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate any suggestions you might have. Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lonely Atheist, Wyoming
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Lonely Atheist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people with above-average levels of intelligence, intellectual loneliness can be as painful as physical loneliness.  They hunger for conversations beyond mundane topics, for dialogue with others who can challenge their minds and who can understand their complex ideas.  While the internet has become a great source for nourishing that hunger, for some of those famished thinkers, blogs, instant messaging, and discussion forums just aren’t enough.  They also need to sit and interact face-to-face with their cerebral compadres.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have three wonderful qualities that are a disadvantage in the region where you live. You’re a woman, you’re smart, and you’re an atheist. To many in the local culture, a woman is automatically dismissible, a smart person is suspect, and an atheist is despicable.  So a smart woman atheist is a serious triple threat to anyone with those prejudices.  When you want to express yourself about things that are important to you, your friends and husband do not take you seriously because they know that they’re no match for you if they try.  So they bait you, and trivialize you into a cute form of entertainment that they don’t have to address directly, something that can’t seriously threaten their world view.  I think you take the bait because your brain is desperate for some kind of  exercise and expression, but you’ll probably never get what you need at that cognitive dry well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll suggest some possible solutions further on, but first be sure you’re not partially buying into the characterization of yourself as “aggressive.” You may be unwittingly falling for a manipulation to encourage you to shut up. Are you &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; aggressive?  Do you yell, swear, or insult the person instead of simply stating your argument against their claim?  Do you want to crush and humiliate them more than simply show that your viewpoint is valid?  Just because you are earnest does not make you aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious people are accustomed to having it easy in their special status where social convention protects their beliefs from critical challenge.  As a result, they’re spoiled and soft.  So they will call any atheist who speaks up “aggressive” even if the atheist is very polite and merely being assertive or frank or worst of all, if she has a good argument.  They can bellow all they want about damnation, condemn others as fools or evil doers, and intrude into places they have no right to be, yet never think of themselves as aggressive, but if someone respectfully says they don’t believe all that, they recoil from such “aggression” as if physically struck.  Observe women who are assertive, articulate and outspoken, and you’ll see that “aggressive” is also often unfairly applied to them, basically to shut them up.  Don’t fall for either of these.  Remain cool, and politely call people on their attempts to squelch you with that trick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for some suggestions, and I hope that the readers out there will chime in with their much more clever and knowledgeable offerings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, improve on two resources that you already have: your husband and the internet.  If you haven’t yet, tell your husband clearly how important this need is to you.  If he either can’t or won’t converse seriously with you about atheism and religion, then at the very least, he should not trivialize you or make fun of you, and he should not encourage your friends to do that.  Even if he disagrees with your opinion, he should be respectful of you as a person, and not participate in belittling you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs and discussion boards are intellectually stimulating, but the best thing and the worst thing about them is  that anybody can join in to the conversation.  They are big, so you can once again feel lost in the crowd, even though this time you’re in a crowd of like-minded people.  You also need a more intimate conversation.  Find a handful of online friends and create a private discussion group site, just for the few of you, to talk privately about these issues and the more personal challenges that surround these issues, such as your frustration and hurt when your friends patronize and mock you.  You and your more confidential online friends will begin to trust and care about each other, and the back-and-forth you can have with them can be very nurturing and healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Wyoming, things that you need will often be far away, so you have to be self-reliant.  If the closest atheist organization is too far away, start your own.  You only need to find two or three other people with similar needs.  Visit or contact that distant atheist group you mentioned and ask if they could help you find a few more people in your area.  They may have met others who live closer to you than where they currently meet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider becoming a student.  You’re busy as a wife and mother, but taking one class in a community college can help feed that mental hunger, and help you find friends who enjoy such discussions.  Take a course in philosophy, logic or comparative religion.  Don’t worry about focusing on the grade. Unless you are planning a career, it doesn’t matter.  Actually, any subject will do.  You’ll be meeting smart people.  Being older than most of the students at a college has some distinct advantages, and you’ll have as much to offer them as they have to offer you.  See yourself in terms of possibilities rather than impossibilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don’t give up.  You’re a rose in the wilderness; you should not be left to fade and wither.  You deserve resources where you will be valued and encouraged.  Demand them, find them, and create them!&lt;/p&gt;

One such ability is calendar calculating - being able to say, with astounding accuracy and alacrity, what day of the week a given date falls on. Just how some savants with autism are able to achieve this feat has baffled researchers. It's been suggested that they use complex algorithms, but this seems implausible given that the same individuals often struggle with maths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help solve the mystery, &lt;a href="http://www.mp.uni-tuebingen.de/mp/index.php?id=56"&gt;Anna Dubischar-Krivec&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues recruited three savant calendar calculators with autism and pitted their calendrical skills against three neuro-typical calendar calculators recruited through a Swiss science TV show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The participants were tested with questions that took the following form: "Is it true that 6 November 1974 = Thurs?". The savants with autism beat the neuro-typical calendar experts, in terms of speed and accuracy, for past dates (these went back fifty years) and dates from the current month. By contrast, the performance of the two groups was matched for future dates, which were taken from up to fifty years ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As usual, the savants were unable to say how they achieved their calendar skills. However, the researchers said the pattern of results implies that the savants were using different strategies from the neuro-typicals. Whereas the neuro-typicals relied on algorithms for past, present and future dates, the savants probably relied on rote memory for past and present dates, the researchers said, hence their superior speed and accuracy for these, whilst they probably fell back on some kind of algorithmic system for future dates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These conclusions were supported by the fact that the savants' answers seemed too quick, at least as regards dates in the current month (their average response time was less than three seconds), for them to have performed algorithmic calculations. Also they appeared to have made use of memory "anchor dates" based around the month of December, as betrayed by their reaction times tending to be quicker for months later and earlier in the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the mystery remains far from solved. For example, if the savants were relying on memory for their astonishing calendrical feats, you'd think a memory test would reveal their unusual memory ability. Yet a standard psychometric comparison of memory performance between the savant and neuro-typical calendar calculators found no differences, except the neuro-typicals were better on a form of working memory.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Psychological+Medicine&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1017%2FS0033291708004601&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Calendar+calculating+in+savants+with+autism+and+healthy+calendar+calculators&amp;amp;rft.issn=0033-2917&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=39&amp;amp;rft.issue=08&amp;amp;rft.spage=1355&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journals.cambridge.org%2Fabstract_S0033291708004601&amp;amp;rft.au=Dubischar-Krivec%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Neumann%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Poustka%2C+F.&amp;amp;rft.au=Braun%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Birbaumer%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=B%C3%B6lte%2C+S.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology"&gt;Dubischar-Krivec, A., Neumann, N., Poustka, F., Braun, C., Birbaumer, N., &amp;amp; Bölte, S.

Head on over to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/"&gt;Steinn's page, Dynamics of Cats&lt;/a&gt; to see this week's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2009/07/extraterrestrial_impacts_carni.php"&gt;Carnival of Space&lt;/a&gt; in full.  Sure, I wrapped up my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a.php"&gt;series on the last 100 years&lt;/a&gt;, but you'll want to take a look at my top 3 from this week's Carnival:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Chandra's 10th anniversary:&lt;/b&gt; it was a big deal when Chandra went up on the Moon landing's 30th anniversary, and so don't forget to celebrate &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/blog/node/148"&gt;our great X-ray observatory's&lt;/a&gt; greatest discoveries, including the first &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/1e0657/"&gt;incontrovertible evidence for dark matter&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Jupiter struck by something!&lt;/b&gt;  Asteroid?  Comet?  &lt;i&gt;ALIEN?&lt;/i&gt;  Just what was it that struck Jupiter last week, and how did we figure it out?  &lt;a href="http://www.cosmicdiary.org/blogs/nasa/franck_marchis/?p=404"&gt;The story is here for you.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/carnival_of_space_113_is_here/ISS.jpg" width="500" alt="ISS.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Get out of Earth's orbit!&lt;/b&gt;  Are you hugely disappointed that humans haven't left Earth's orbit since 1972?  Well, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/should_we_go_to_mars_or_not.php"&gt;I am&lt;/a&gt;, but Bruce Cordell at 21st century waves takes a look at &lt;a href="http://21stcenturywaves.com/blog/2009/07/20/tom-wolfes-giant-leap-to-nowhere/"&gt;Tom Wolfe's opinion&lt;/a&gt;, which is definitely worth reading!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the latest Carnival of Space!  And for those of you who want an update on the status of my hair, it's still here.  We're up to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_charity_ch.php"&gt;84 donations of time, goods, and/or money&lt;/a&gt;, so we only need 16 more to get my head shaved!

Her take is that, since it would be morally repugnant to acquiesce to an individual that bore even a passing resemblance to the Old Testament God, the appropriate response to evidence of eternal damnation would be to live one's life as if it didn't exist, a sort of epic existential thumbing-of-the-nose at this hypothetical supreme being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree on the moral repugnance of obedience-under-threat, but in my opinion, if there were enough evidence to make the existence of a Hell-threatening God the simplest explanation, it would be incumbent upon humanity to do whatever we could to oppose said deity.  We're getting a bit sci-fi now, but you get my point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Okay," says my wife, "but what if the god were omnipotent?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't really answer this question because I don't think the idea of omnipotence is even self-consistent.  It is a semantic trick, not an actual definable concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The classic question is, "Could God create a stone so large even He couldn't lift it?"  (Or, if you prefer the wisdom of the Simpsons, "Could God microwave a burrito so hot even He couldn't eat it?")  Omnipotence by its very nature is self-contradictory.  This hypothetical omnipotent being cannot have powers that contradict its other powers... and since the examples above show that some conceivable powers clearly contradict each other, it doesn't make sense to say that a being has all conceivable powers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;If this image was a broken link, what color would the Unicorn be?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn.svg/263px-Invisible_Pink_Unicorn.svg.png"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:130px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn.svg/263px-Invisible_Pink_Unicorn.svg.png" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I think it goes beyond this, though.  When we say that "God can do anything," what do we even mean by that?  It is like saying, "The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_pink_unicorn"&gt;Invisible Pink Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; is all colors at once."  It sounds poetic, but the sentence is ultimately devoid of content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Omnipresence is similarly meaningless.  Omniscience is at least a definable concept, but it is also inherently impossible because of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del&amp;#39;s_incompleteness_theorems"&gt;Gödel's incompleteness theorems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which roughly state that no system can ever fully describe itself.  In other words, you could hypothetically have a near-omniscient being, but there would have to be some aspects of itself that remained unknown to it.  This makes good intuitive sense, as well, because you get an infinite regress -- the mechanism that allows the hypothetical omniscient being to know that last teensy bit about itself must also be known to it, and the mechanism for knowing the mechanism must also be known, so on ad infinitum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I don't think we need to answer the question of, "Would you live your life any differently if there is an omnipotent being who" yada-yada-yada... the question is not fully parseable.  However, we can answer the question, "Would you live your life any differently if there really was a magic sky daddy &lt;table width="200" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;If this guy could walk on water and raise the dead, wouldn't he still be a fucking douchebag?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Kim_Jong_il_2009_2.jpg/386px-Kim_Jong_il_2009_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:320px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Kim_Jong_il_2009_2.jpg/386px-Kim_Jong_il_2009_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;who held all sorts of bigoted opinions about women and homosexuals and people who aren't sufficiently gullible?"  And the answer, for me, is a resounding YES, because then I would be rather keen to either a) convince the magic sky daddy not to be such a dick, or b) figure out some way of stopping the magic sky daddy from doing his dirty deeds.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suppose the answer would be the same as, "What would you do if you lived under a repressive totalitarian government?"  I can't say for sure that in all situations I would have the bravery to stand up and oppose injustice, but I'd like to think I would.  Whether the repressive government is run by a bunch of humans or by an angry deity in the sky, I don't see as how it would make that much of a difference in our response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Thanks to reader eduardopadoan for reminding me of the name of this concept.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-7879883147325017621?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248723506253"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/27/cos-113/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55d6d63951cc845c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">CoS 113</title><published>2009-07-27T18:41:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T18:41:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/27/cos-113/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m busy recovering from Comic Con as well as prepping a CC post, so in the meantime why not head over to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2009/07/extraterrestrial_impacts_carni.php"&gt;The Dynamics of Cats to read the 113th Carnival of Space&lt;/a&gt;?

There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done to get it on the air… and I’ve never done a thing in radio except maybe turning one on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could start or help start a local skeptical radio show, what would it be like? Who would you have on? What topics would you cover? How would you run your show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you like to hear on a local skeptical radio show? What would set it apart from all the podcasts and blogs you already listen to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to Augustus Porter for giving me the idea for this question… especially since I’m running late posting this today and my brain is stuck in Saturday-mode.)&lt;/p&gt;

Here's print coverage from &lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/07/68495367/1"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; and (ironically non-captioned) video coverage from &lt;a href="http://www.c-span.org/Watch/Media/2009/07/24/HP/A/21348/Pres+Obama+Signs+Proclamation+Celebrating+19th+Anniversary+of+Americans+with+Disabilities+Act.aspx"&gt;CSPAN&lt;/a&gt;.  The CSPAN video is of the actual signing ceremony, and it starts off with a nice little speech by Hilary Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thumbs ? : The motivation for the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_5_of_6_ada-aa_whyfor_in_employment"&gt;ADA-AA&lt;/a&gt; came from issues with the way the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had decided to implement the ADA.  The original intent for the ADA is as a &lt;em&gt;civil rights&lt;/em&gt; law, and the ADA-AA was to restore that original intent.  Now &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/debate-about-ada-amendments-implementation-.html"&gt;debates about EEOC implementation&lt;/a&gt; seem to be intent on leeching the power from the amendment.  Will the fate of the ADA-AA be to restore the ADA as powerful civil rights legislation, or will we end up back at square one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thumbs Down: As the CCA remains off the legislative agenda, CCA rallies continue with &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;confronted the Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt;.  Adapt has set up a sweet &lt;a href="http://www.adapt.org/takeaction/"&gt;action campaign page&lt;/a&gt;, complete with (also transcribed) video.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all news on the CCA front is bad; some &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/cca-gains-momentum-check-on-your-legislators.html"&gt;legislators have signed onto it&lt;/a&gt;.

Sometimes it's too easy.  You see, when you criticize someone for being wrong, that's one thing, but when you imply that they are wrong because their entire world-view is incorrect, well, sometimes you get a response.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a piece last week I was very critical of a new diet and it's creator, and she apparently watches the web,  because &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/magic.php#c1798327"&gt;she came by to comment.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From reading her website and her comment, I get the distinct impression that, like many people, she is sincere in her wrongness, and probably a good person as well.  But as we've discussed before, being sincere does not excuse someone from ethical culpability.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you recall, I criticized her, perhaps too broadly (and perhaps not) for claiming that INFLAMMATION was the ONE CAUSE OF ALL DISEASE, and that her special diet could fix that.  Of course, as far as she is concerned, her ideas are far more nuanced, so let's let her speak for herself and see where I got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/when_you_believe_your_own_lie.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/when_you_believe_your_own_lie.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/8kvmnG7Qo0M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248717032590"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/att_vs_4chan.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2dcc59e62be2640</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">AT&amp;amp;T vs. 4chan</title><published>2009-07-27T17:54:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T17:54:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/k75PVzfxz6Y/att_vs_4chan.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/att_vs_4chan.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine a titanic battle. No, not &lt;i&gt;T. rex&lt;/i&gt; vs. a killer whale, but something more alarming, like &lt;i&gt;T. rex&lt;/i&gt; vs. a massive bacterial infection. Which side do you think will win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something similar is going on right now. AT&amp;amp;T, the &lt;i&gt;T. rex&lt;/i&gt; of the story, is &lt;a href="http://stormen.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/att-blocks-4chan/"&gt;going after 4chan&lt;/a&gt;, the infamous nest of /b/tards and fierce crackers and hackers, an unstoppable plague of corruption. AT&amp;amp;T is doomed if they continue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has been sneakily trying to silence 4chan by quietly dropping access requests to the site by users on their network. I am not a great fan of 4chan (actually, I tremble in fear at even &lt;i&gt;mentioning&lt;/i&gt; them, so I have to respect them—I&amp;#39;d rather piss off the Catholic Church than 4chan), but in this case I have to be on their side without reservation. AT&amp;amp;T is violating net neutrality and trying to censor voices on the web…and even if they succeeded in completely silencing one site on the web, the net is fluid, and they&amp;#39;ll just emerge elsewhere. With a grudge and a cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An update direct from 4chan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past three weeks, 4chan has been under a constant DDoS attack.
We were able to filter this specific type of attack in a fashion that
was more or less transparent to the end user.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, as an unintended consequence of the method used, some
Internet users received errant traffic from one of our network
switches. A handful happened to be AT&amp;amp;T customers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In response, AT&amp;amp;T filtered all traffic to and from our img.4chan.org
IPs (which serve /b/ &amp;amp; /r9k/) for their entire network, instead of only
the affected customers. AT&amp;amp;T did not contact us prior to implementing
the block. Here is their statement regarding the matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the end, this wasn&amp;#39;t a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit
of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s
part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably
didn&amp;#39;t anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed
interest and debate over net neutrality and internet censorship?two
very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention?so
perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Aside from that, I'll also add that there is some big news due later
this week. Keep an eye on the News page, Twitter, and global message
for updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/att_vs_4chan.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/k75PVzfxz6Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248716851634"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/your_r01_may_not_be_as_confide.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e8b261577e6d1ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Get Some Damned Money"/><title type="html">Your R01 May Not Be as Confidential as You Think...</title><published>2009-07-27T16:42:49Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:42:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/NgBomBmakzI/your_r01_may_not_be_as_confide.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/your_r01_may_not_be_as_confide.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today Isis submitted her grant.

&lt;p&gt;Apparently one of the Drugmonkey readers has received a letter demanding a copy of an already funded &lt;a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/r01.htm"&gt;R01&lt;/a&gt; from an anonymous investigator through another university via the &lt;a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/index.html"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a snippet to titillate you with....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am an assistant professor (about 3 years into starting my lab) at a research university. On Monday of this week, I received an email from a freedom of information act specialist saying that a secretary at another research university had requested a copy of my recently funded R01 and that I had 5 days to comply. I called the secretary (who was requesting for an anonymous physician) and explained to her that there was a ton of unpublished data and a research plan for the lab that I thought when writing was confidential. I then offered to send her the grant in its entirety without government involvement if she would have the physician send me an email promising to keep it confidential. I should point out that I am very good about sharing reagents and have given out my grants (funded R01, R21, R03 and foundation grants) to others with the agreement that they stay confidential. Two days after my phone call (and subsequent email), this secretary sent a very curt email saying that they "preferred to go through the freedom of information act [FOIA]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a bit of scariness left by the original author &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/letter_from_a_reader_foia_requ.php#comment-1796958"&gt;in the comments section&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also, it actually makes you wonder if the lab notebooks filled with data generated with NIH money are also subject to the FOIA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a thought from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/letter_from_a_reader_foia_requ.php#comment-1796967"&gt;another commenter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm going to side with the FOIA on this one. Just send the grant. The FOIA request is not at all outrageous. Keeping these public documents "pseudo-confidential" by insisting on an FOIA request is just another way the ClubbyBoyz keep the cash in the club. I'd like to see ALL the NIH funded proposals aired out on the internet: probably would help advance the speed of science too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/letter_from_a_reader_foia_requ.php"&gt;their post&lt;/a&gt; and the discussion happening over there.  Those guys really are the kick-ass dukes of federal funding.  But, as a recent critic of unbridled Open Access, this does make Dr. Isis wonder -- how much of your publicly funded data should be in the public domain?  Does the FOIA require disclosure of any tidbit of data generated with public monies?  Would people be alright with their data and grants in the public domain if there were an embargo period?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Who should have access to ones ideas?  Other scientists?  The lay public?  As is pointed out, requesting grants, etc. through the FOIA is a strategy used by "animal rights" extremists. How should MRUs protect their scientists from terrorist groups that might use this as a tactic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the media? Should traditional journalists (and, I suppose bloggers) be allowed access to grants and preliminary data to be able to report on the happenings at MRUs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you know Dr. Isis's response to this, but I would be interested to hear anyone with even a mildly compelling argument that grants should be in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where is Martin Frank of the American Physiological Society when we need him?  Off in Japan &lt;a href="http://http//twitter.com/execdirectoraps"&gt;live-tweeting the IUPS conference&lt;/a&gt; or something?  Can't we get him to march over to the Capitol and tell those congress critters, "Oh, hellz no!" (cause I imagine that is exactly how he would say it). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/your_r01_may_not_be_as_confide.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/NgBomBmakzI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248716851633"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/undergraduate_transcripts_of_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8ae8a69491a6014</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Careers"/><title type="html">Undergraduate Transcripts of a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><published>2009-07-27T16:07:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:07:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/rPPfX8gF-SE/undergraduate_transcripts_of_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/undergraduate_transcripts_of_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My most darling little chickens,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel the need to apologize to you all.  You see, all this time I have been perpetrating a great lie.  I have been masquerading as a super hot science-doing domestic and laboratory deity, when in fact I am no more qualified to speak about being a successful scientist than the dude who made my coffee this morning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been writing this grant and in order to submit it I have had to assemble records of my life back to the 2nd grade.  So, I called to my former MRUs and industrial employers to get records of my existence and in my file from graduate school were my undergraduate transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I apologize to you all.  I have chosen some of the highlights for your enjoyment:&lt;/p&gt;

In one of them recently I was told by parents who raised several believing children, some of whom are in the ministry, it is "impossible" for them to tell their kids the truth. Bullshit! It's not impossible, although it may be hard, and there may be adverse consequences, and you may want to wait to do so in the future at a more appropriate time. &lt;strong&gt;But it's not impossible.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of these kind of fears are simply unjustified. Here's one example of what I mean:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A friend of mine on &lt;em&gt;Facebook &lt;/em&gt;named Luke Haugen was extremely fearful to tell his parents. They visited with him and he just couldn't tell them. But even though he expected the worse he called them after they visited him and then he told them. With his permission here's what he said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I had a great week with my parents. They had an awesome vacation out here. I think my Dad didn't want to leave. They also fell in love with my girlfriend, which I knew they would just like I did. I talked it over with my sister at the beginning of the week and told her that I was going to do it and she got really worried that when I told them they would freak out and it would ruin their vacation. So I decided to wait until they got back home and got settled in for a few days to call my Dad. He was surprisingly much more understanding that I was anticipating. I gave him a few of my reasons and asked him a few questions that he had a really hard time answering with the most common answer being "I don't know." He even said that I should have told him while he was here, which, I wish I would've done now but either way, at least they know who I really am. Overall it went very smoothly and they still do love me and I love them. I am sure you can relate to how awesome it feels to get that huge weight off of your shoulders especially after it has been burdening you for a number of years and you have had to "fake it" in certain situations. I am much more comfortable and at peace with where I stand now that everyone knows who I really am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels so great to finally have my family know who I really am!&lt;/blockquote&gt;To read some of my advice to people who leave the fold &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/advice-to-people-who-leave-fold.html"&gt;check this link out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8571851716601240058?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

For example, in 2008 the president-elect of The Obesity Society (an association of obesity researchers and practitioners which counts both Peter and I as members) was forced to resign following the backlash that erupted when he acted as a paid consultant arguing against a law requiring calorie counts on menus in New York City.  Not exactly watergate, but a pretty big deal in the world of obesity research.

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/francis-collins-pollutes-science-with-religion/"&gt;Jerry Coyne has a long piece up&lt;/a&gt; that chews over that awful talk Collins gave at Berkeley. He has the full recording of the whole talk — it was titled &amp;quot;The Language of God: Intellectual Reflections of a Christian Geneticist&amp;quot;, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the fifth word slipped in there entirely by mistake — and it is a genuinely appalling load of rubbish. It&amp;#39;s two hours long, but I could only make it through the first half hour before having to give up. I thought I had a strong stomach from years of wading through the creationist literature, but I guess I have limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran away in exasperation at the point where he starts babbling about the fine-tuning argument, claiming that there are only two possible choices: either there is a multiverse with an infinite number of possibilities to explore, or the cosmic constants were chosen by his god. What about chance? There's nothing impossible about the fact that our universe was the product of a chance event: after all, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am the product of a chance event, a randomized mixture of the genes of two people equally the product of chance. You can&amp;#39;t simply rule out the importance of chance events in the history of individuals or the universe, but Collins does. And what about necessity? It may be that a universe can only exist if it possesses an interlocked set of constants…that, in fact, all the parameters of the universe are co-contingent and co-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've read his book, but I hadn't experienced the full force of his looniness until I'd seen that presentation. The man is a flaming idjit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/god-and-country/2009/07/24/does-francis-collinss-faith-have-any-benefits-for-the-nih.html"&gt;US New and World Report weighs in&lt;/a&gt;, too, and asks a couple of reasonable questions that I have to answer in the negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But isn't it possible that Collins's faith might be valuable for NIH beyond its PR power?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From spending some time with him, it appears that Collins's scientific curiosity is at least partially motivated by a faith-based desire to understand what he believes is God's universe. Isn't that a net positive, given that it helped him lead the team that decoded the human genome?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And might not his faith lend guidance on inevitable questions he'll face around scientific ethics? Don't those ethics have to be rooted in some moral or religious system that transcends pure science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is a fine thing and I have to encourage any wellspring for it. However, the defining feature of Collins' faith, and that part of it that makes it objectionable, is that he uses it to wall off parts of the human world from curiosity. The human genome project was a technological exercise, a sustained, disciplined effort to apply developing tools to a specific, narrow problem. It opens up new avenues for science, but &lt;i&gt;in itself&lt;/i&gt; was not a demonstration of &lt;i&gt;scientific&lt;/i&gt; competence. His administrative ability led the work to a conclusion, not his scientific skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what has he done with it afterwards? Declared the genome a divine artifact, decreed that certain domains, such as human behavior and morality, are exempt from scientific scrutiny, and proposed a succession of freakish Christian dogmas as substitutes for reasoned analysis. At this point, where the real science takes over, his faith only gets in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please, don't &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; equate faith with ethics. They have nothing to do with each other, except, perhaps, that faith is a commonly used escape clause to get away from the requirements of human morality. Science itself is a tool, as amoral as a hammer, and it certainly can be misused, but don&amp;#39;t go crawling to the priests for guidance. Let&amp;#39;s hear from philosophers, psychologists, sociologists, and lawyers long, long before we consult with theologians—I can&amp;#39;t imagine a worse fate for scientific ethics than for it to fall under the sway of a dogmatic Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/07/sam-harris-on-francis-collins.html"&gt;Russell Blackford takes a pragmatic approach&lt;/a&gt;: we&amp;#39;re stuck with Collins, there isn&amp;#39;t much we can do to oppose his appointment, and we can&amp;#39;t even make the argument that he&amp;#39;s a crummy bureaucrat — he&amp;#39;ll do a competent job in the office. I agree completely. There really are no plans for the godless horde to march on Washington, there will be no effigies burnt, we aren&amp;#39;t going to even throw rotten tomatoes at the NIH building. We will sigh and go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we will continue to make quiet complaint, and we will be scrutinizing his actions carefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is this: the White House has picked for high office a well-known scientist with a good track record in management who wears clown shoes. Worse, this scientist likes to stroll about with his clown shoes going squeak-squeak-squeak, pointing them out to everyone, and bragging about how red and shiny and gosh-darned &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; his shoes are, and tut-tutting at the apparent lack of fine fashion sense exhibited by his peers who wear rather less flamboyant footwear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would rather Obama had appointed someone who wore practical shoes, and didn't make much of a fuss about them, anyway. And excuse me, but I don't want American science to be represented by a clown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/monday_must_be_pick_on_francis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DXuS5YFwVlQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248714000448"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4333">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffce66d3b520604a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 Words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Ergates spiculatus</title><published>2009-07-27T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T18:16:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/ergates-spicula.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Paul Burnett&lt;/strong&gt;.

Here’s an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIME: How do you think the debate over global warming has progressed since you published &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mooney: We’ve come such a long way just because of political change — it’s not like the science changed at all, but the politics changed — and yet it’s still an incredible struggle. The &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1907248,00.html"&gt;vote in the House&lt;/a&gt; [on a bill to combat global warming] was superclose, and the Senate’s going to be probably even closer. The reason that issue is so hard is that we have a gigantic gap between scientists and the public — and by association, the politicians that represent them. Scientists have been quite strong on this for 20 years and still only half of America seems to know what they’re talking about.&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1670875,00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; you’ve moved on to a more overarching discussion about “scientific illiteracy” in society that threatens to hinder productivity in the U.S. What are some ways we’ve fallen behind or are in danger of falling behind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Science drives innovation which drives growth, and the concerns are very serious that we are slipping in that area. There are attempts to address it but they are nothing like what you saw after Sputnik when we really, really decided that we were going to be competitive. We’re not throwing everything into it. People just aren’t in tune to the role of science in the future of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, I finally got around to trying it last night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were some execution issues with using this technique on a larger bird, but all in all it came out pretty well.  I still think my favorite way of preparing duck is a braise, though... that is the only method I have found that sufficiently breaks down the fat enough for my tastes.  This was still delicious, though, and I can definitely recommend it if you like roast duck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I almost never use my charcoal grill, but I decided to go for it this time.  For one thing, the burner layout on my gas grill is not good for indirect cooking.  For another, I thought the smokiness might give it a nice flavor.  Mostly, it was because I had bought a charcoal chimney a month or two ago and still hadn't gotten a chance to try it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had been worried that the lid on my grill wasn't tall enough to accommodate a fully-upright duck, but this turned out to be irrelevant, as it also turns out that a beer can in its ass is not sufficient support to keep a duck fully-upright.  As you can see in the &lt;table width="200" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;My jury-rigged system for propping up the duck&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/Sm3TqvjJ2tI/AAAAAAAAADw/ExszrDTZmK0/s1600-h/proppedduck.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:163px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/Sm3TqvjJ2tI/AAAAAAAAADw/ExszrDTZmK0/s320/proppedduck.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;picture to the left, I had to kinda prop up the other end with a second beer can.  Maybe a stick or skewer or something may have been better here.  I dunno.  Anyway, it worked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think what really made this duck delicious was the marinade I used.  It was loosely inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mighty-duck-recipe/index.html"&gt;Alton Brown's duck recipe&lt;/a&gt;.  The amounts in the recipe below are &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; approximate, because I did one of those "little bit of this, little bit of that" things, but it should be fairly tolerant to variations.  I was extremely pleased with the flavor it gave to the skin.  Probably the wood chips I used didn't hurt either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recipe and more pics below the fold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beer Can Duck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/Sm3TTPcMNnI/AAAAAAAAADo/FL9PPW0yEWM/s1600-h/halfcooked.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:148px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/Sm3TTPcMNnI/AAAAAAAAADo/FL9PPW0yEWM/s320/halfcooked.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup pineapple-orange juice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp whole mustard seed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp black peppercorns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tsp whole cloves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-6 garlic cloves, smashed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one 5-lb. duck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one or two cans of cheap beer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sweet wood chips, soaked in water (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combine first seven ingredients and place with duck in a large freezer bag.  Let marinate in refridgerator for 4-8 hours.  Remove duck from marinade and scrape off any peppercorns or cloves that cling to it (if a few mustard seeds stick to it, that's okay).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;A charcoal grill set up for indirect cooking&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/Sm3SU7xhtPI/AAAAAAAAADg/I-qD_6zzfLk/s1600-h/twolevelfire.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:200px;height:145px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/Sm3SU7xhtPI/AAAAAAAAADg/I-qD_6zzfLk/s320/twolevelfire.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Set grill up for indirect cooking: For a charcoal grill, get the coals going good and then pile them all up on one side.  For a gas grill, turn on only half the burners.  If you have an actual indirect barbecue, you're way ahead of me, I'm sure you can figure it out.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When grill is ready, chug a third of one beer and shove it in the duck's cavity.  Place duck on the cool side of the grill.  If duck won't stand up straight, chug half of another beer and use it to prop up the other end of the duck.  If using wood chips, place them in a wood chip box, or however you do your wood chips, on the hot side of the grill.  Cover grill.  Check duck after 20-30 minutes and if it is cooking unevenly, turn it appropriately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cook until duck reaches desired doneness, about 1 hour for medium rare (internal temp of 150F) or about 1 1/2 hours for a more done duck (165-175F).  Remove duck from grill, tent loosely with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes before carving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-9067271873456055316?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248712589743"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/27/good-bad-and-government-funding/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6052c94b716a494b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Brains"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Good, Bad, and Government Funding</title><published>2009-07-27T16:13:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:13:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/27/good-bad-and-government-funding/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/transcripts/collins/collins.jpg" align="left" width="166" height="227"&gt;The National Institutes of Health funds research on &lt;a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/news_articles/brain_activity_during_altruism.htm"&gt;the biology of morality in the human brain&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18757730"&gt;the evolution of  human morality&lt;/a&gt; by comparing humans to other primates. Francis Collins, who has been nominated to head NIH, has repeatedly criticized this sort of research–and has used its failure as evidence for the existence of God. In 2008, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.thehighcalling.org/Library/ViewLibrary.asp?LibraryID=4469"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, “I think human altruism can be seen as one of strongest signposts to the existence of a personal God. I can see no fully satisfactory explanation for it coming from biology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be curious to know if Collins thinks NIH shouldn’t have funded this research in the past, and if he would cut it in the future. If I were a reporter who went to DC press conferences rather than one that sits at home in his slippers, that’s the question I’d ask–not as a gotcha question, but as a matter on which I cannot figure out an answer based on what he’s said in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal"&gt;Frans de Waal&lt;/a&gt;, who does the NIH-funded research on primates I linked to above (and writes lots of interesting trade books on said topic), posted a response I’m pulling up here into the post itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, Collins has in the past taken human altruism as proof that God exists, seeing it as a miraculous trait that evolution couldn’t possibly have produced. I disagree, having argued that the building blocks of morality can be found in other animals. I am closer to Darwin than CS Lewis on this. But in response to your blog I must say that I am not sure that Collins will have the power to prevent specific research (such as neuroscience on morality). Furthermore I doubt that he wouldn’t want to know the answers. He is a scientist, after all, and I bet he is open-minded enough to be curious about the outcome of such research even if it doesn’t fully agree with his previous position. Or, am I just being an optimist here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your thoughts, Frans. Of one thing I am sure: the labyrinth of NIH funding is terra incognita for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update #2: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_R._Miller"&gt;Ken Miller&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist well known for his books on the relationship between science and religions, has also left a comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The worry that Francis Collins would use his position at the NIH to “proselytize” or would not back researchers whom “the religious right dislikes” isn’t grounded in the reality of the man’s life and career.  I’m no more worried about Collins using NIH to advance his religious views than I was about Harold Varmus using the same position to advance non-religious views.  Varmus was a great Director because he was a first-rate scientist who understood how to administer research, and Collins matches him on both counts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, Collins has written that he doesn’t think that biological evolution can explain the human moral sense.  I disagree with him on that point, even as a fellow Christian.  But Collins’ whole career has been marked by openness, fair-mindedness, and above all, a driving intellectual curiosity.  The over-reaction of those sounding the warning sirens about him is without foundation in fact.  It’s also emotional to the point of irrationality.  PZ Myers has called him “a clown,” and written that “The man is a flaming idjit.”  This comes from a guy who opposes Collins in the name of scientific reason?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248712398967"><id gr:original-id="http://www.connectionseducationresearch.com/blog/2009/07/27/influences-on-peer-review-authors-as-reviewers/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/968e02ffa7d461e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Influences on Peer Review: Authors as Reviewers</title><published>2009-07-27T10:33:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T10:33:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/GAU-q7LhICc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.connectionseducationresearch.com/blog/2009/07/27/influences-on-peer-review-authors-as-reviewers/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I usually stick to education research topics, but part of what influences what I see there is what actually gets published.

The tragedy was compounded by the fact that this was the &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; Caltech student to do so in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among college students.&lt;/strong&gt;  In the aftermath of such an event, there is a feeling of powerlessness; you try to console or sympathize with anyone who might have known the student, but at the end of the day there’s no much you can do.  But it is possible to take some steps to try to prevent such tragedies from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed that, in over 80 percent of cases, people who attempt suicide are struggling with some form of mental illness, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia.  Although there is no way to know for sure whether someone is contemplating such a drastic step, there are certain warning signs, including severe depression and changes in mood or habits.  Caltech has set up a website on preventing suicide and violence, which goes over some of the signs and ways that a friend can take steps to help persuade someone from going too far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.counseling.caltech.edu/safetynet.html"&gt;http://www.counseling.caltech.edu/safetynet.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that many universities (and companies) have similar resources; it’s worth taking a minute to familiarize yourself with what’s available where you work or go to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, if you’ve ever contemplated suicide yourself:  don’t do it.  That’s cheap and easy advice, but the crucial point is to make sure you stop, talk to people, and take advantage of counselors.  Being a college student can be an extraordinarily stressful and pressure-filled time; if you’re feeling overwhelmed, be assured that it’s not just you, and that it is possible to get through it.  You will find people who are willing to listen, understand, and try to be helpful, if you are willing to reach out to them.  Tough times can be overcome, but taking a life is irrevocable.  Seek help before the pressure gets to be too much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248710958498"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=15641">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19f015ff0e09e9e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="airport"/><title type="html">The Evolution of Airports</title><published>2009-07-27T16:03:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:03:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/4IDpdoRS7Tk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/the-evolution-of-airports/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">While we've been hard at work answering &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/captain-steve/"&gt;your flying questions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; has taken a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2223232/"&gt;history of airport design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/4IDpdoRS7Tk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248709667332"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=866">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b635d9d118419c65</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="accomodationism"/><category term="biologos"/><category term="francis collins"/><category term="science"/><category term="unscientific america"/><title type="html">Compromise, Compatibility, and Invisible Ink</title><published>2009-07-27T15:08:10Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T15:08:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/07/27/compromise-compatibility-and-invisible-ink/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, look who’s posting on the &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/07/a-call-for-peace-in-the-sciencefaith-battle.html"&gt;BioLogos blog&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt; authors Mooney and Kirshenbaum, writing about the “supposed ‘conflict’ between science and religion” (and endorsing BioLogos founder Francis Collins, although it’s conceivable that this endorsement was merely a requirement to get the post published on the BioLogos blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the square quotes (and also the “supposed”) you’d probably guess that they don’t believe there’s a conflict, and you’d be right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common ground, instead, must be science in its broadest sense–a shared body of facts we can all agree about, however we may differ about the spiritual. Yet this common ground itself is at risk if we let science and faith be in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see what they’re saying.  We all agree on the age of the earth; the best explanation for the appearance of design in nature; whether there was a sudden, world-wide flood at some point in the past; the meaning of a frozen waterfall; and the existence of thetans.  And so we shouldn’t let our “spiritual” differences get in the way of this common ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if there’s one principle that’s important to the practice of science, it’s &lt;i&gt;majoritarianism&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, the vast majority of Americas want nothing to do with this conflict. They want compromise, and compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s what they want, then who am I to argue?  Tell me, Mooney and Kirshenbaum, how can I help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you see the news media cover “science versus religion” as if it’s a battle, write or call in and say why that’s simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear New York Times,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice that you have recently described “science versus religion” as a “battle.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You seem to have bought into the claims of Canadian/American indie-rock supergroup The New Atheists that science and religion are somehow in “conflict.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are literally dozens of scientific claims that the religious and the non-religious can agree upon: everything from “vinegar has a sour flavor” to “if you rub a balloon with a wooly sweater it will stick to your hair” to “if you use the tip of your thumb to block off the top of a straw when you remove it from your soda, the liquid will stay in place and not run out of the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every time your paper references more contentious areas of science like biology and physics and chemistry and geology, you’re implicitly supporting the forces of anti-religion and making it less likely that we’ll ever reach our goal of a society where everyone knows you can use lemon juice as invisible ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you could adopt this more restrictive definition of “science,” it would really help out new NIH head Francis Collins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Sam Dupuis from the &lt;a href="http://samandspace.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Science of Sorts on My Mind&lt;/a&gt; blog (and yes, he is the son of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/" title=""&gt;John Dupuis&lt;/a&gt;, if the last name sounded familiar to you), to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="SamDupuis pic.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/SamDupuis%20pic.JPG" width="336" height="402" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Glad to be here, in that way one can be said to have a presence on the Internet. My full name is Samuel Allen Greene Dupuis, and a while ago I discovered that if I, for almost whatever reason, were to change my name, then I'd also go for an acronym that would, suffice to say, not be SAGD. I'm sixteen years old at the time of writing this (I was about to turn 16 when I was at ScienceOnline '09). I currently go to Northern SS in Toronto, Canada, and I'm trying to emphasize math, science, and languages while I'm here. I've also found myself referring to my school path as a 'build', which may go to show exactly how much I play DotA (First, think World of Warcraft, The company that made it is Blizzard; they also make Warcraft III. This is a strategy game in which one may also create their own modified versions and spread them online; one map [a 'version' here is essentially a map with rules] is called Defence of the Ancients (DotA); I play it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up, and what is growing up anyway?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on being either a medical researcher or a physicist, but plans change; I've had other ideas in the past, and I'll probably have new ones later (being a politician just to see how I fare when I throw myself into the eye of the public storm). With regard to growing up, I'm thinking for now that the difference between someone in their late teens and someone who's 40 or 50, as far as personality goes, isn't huge. In my opinion, the difference may be between what they know when they're younger and when they're older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what said person 'knows' pretty much amounts to their experiences, from information they've acquired to experiences they've felt deeply affected by. It doesn't seem like an easily falsifiable hypothesis, so for now I'm just noting it as almost entirely pointless, but amusing, speculation. Growing up, as far as I know, would be an increase in maturity up to some semi- (but not completely) arbitrary threshold, which would be some series of thresholds across a wide range of ways a person behaves. Now, it seems that I've become a nihilist over the last few years (I'd only really thought about it recently, and I figure myself to be the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life#Nihilism" title=""&gt;heroic variety&lt;/a&gt; as defined in this article. Please trust me not to have said this only because it looks awesome, and I acknowledge this is only coming from Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think words like maturity, good, bad and beneficial are subjective through and through, and that one doesn't always have to be mature to benefit oneself and society (Please note that I have and will continue to toss these words around for now for simplicity's sake-- because we're all ok with that, right?). I'll say now that the one thing I may never change my mind on is that I'll be changing my mind on at least something or another for as long as I live. And though I may try to mature for a while, I may go where I will depending on what I'm thinking at the time, because when predicting the future, even my own, I'm very ambiguous. So I'll probably do some more growing up, maybe some growing down (shrinking?) and other maturity-morphing sideways, forwards, backwards, and into other imagined dimensions where I find them (because I like trying to think outside the cube).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some volunteering over the summer--it ended yesterday, and I've looked after some guy's house for small amounts of money (taking turns/splitting the money with my brother, at that), but I'm still a jobless high school student. In fact, my brother has a job, and he's only entering high school this year. I like to say I'm less of a materialist and capitalist than he is. He retorts by calling me a jobless hippie. We're at a standstill on that one right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not entirely sure. I haven't explored these in much depth. This may just be a thought that occurred to me because my attention span can be sub-par, but I've been wondering how people can most efficiently manage citation and other references online. For instance, say you're in one of the endless number of online arguments about something in which there isn't necessarily scientific consensus, but there is a substantial amount of literature from experts, as well as data to go with it. Now, there are people who simply won't be careful enough with how they manage this without at least being told sternly to do so, but otherwise it can be annoying (at least from my point of view) to comb through huge amounts of writing to, to some degree, memorize every single relevant point (so you don't get berated for missing it, on top of actually being better informed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been wondering (just now, not for any serious length of time) if there's some sort of more advanced search system for word documents that doesn't just find specific words or phrases, but that can also search on specific pages when prompted, specific paragraphs, sections, and any (or some) other conceivable divisions a document can have-- even on one or another side of media or other objects that may be in the document. Also, what if one could import parameters from someone else that would take the receiver to exactly where the sender intended? What if one could also have searches that could open up other windows or at least show different parts of a document at the same time, for example, pairing original text and annotations? There are probably myriad other places such Xtremely-advanced searching could go, and there may also be the equivalents (or the same things) as everything I've mentioned, somewhere out there. Much or all of it may just be further convenience for the already lazy. Still, I'm interested in more accessibility not necessarily geared only toward experts (who are presumably more patient anyway), but as a way to more easily spread relevant information to laypeople (from laypeople and experts alike) who aren't otherwise willing to look carefully and for a while through piles of information when not all of it is actually necessary with regard to what's relevant to the issue at hand (I had been mostly thinking about that since SO09, pretty much, but I've also been interested by all the citations on Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would I pair that with? A chat system, which in turn would be combined with a forum, sounds interesting; ScienceOnline is itself largely about the many ways scientists can communicate with each other, so I'm sure there are several versions of the pairing I just mentioned. With the addition of many of the other services that are becoming, have become and may become available, this might be one more thing tacked on that, hopefully, would be helpful without being intrusive, bulky, redundant, or otherwise unneeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? How much will they in the future?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Grade 9, I had a science project to do that was supposed to be about anything that had to do with the curriculum. They were pretty loose on this definition: if it in any way had to do with space, biology, physics, or electromagnetism (the very direct subset of physics we went into with more detail), you could go on any sort of quest to find out more about it provided you could and it was legal. This was such an open-ended and large assignment that my mind was blown for a couple of minutes (not because it was only one or another, but both). Then I wasn't sure what to do. I can't remember who later suggested a blog (me or my dad, who's prodded me a lot and for a while now to keep my blog going), but I ended up writing a blog about what I could learn about space exploration. It has simply become my blog, and is found at &lt;a href="http://samandspace.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;samandspace.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;. I've been filling the blog with things I find online, when I get inspired (but often when my dad asks for some consistency, too; he still often gives me great places to go, too), and it's had a few visitors from Google or links from my dad's blog. I guess it shouldn't be too surprising that a solid portion of these visitors have been from faraway countries, but it's still amazing to see that tracked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging aside, I haven't really used much social networking at school; often I use email for working out project dates and for handling electronic information with group members, and toward the end of last year I found Facebook useful for contacting people in a hurry (because I'm not the only person I know who lets things go down to the wire). I got on Twitter briefly for some reason I've now forgotten, and I haven't used Friendfeed or any other site specifically used for networking with an identity. I went on Omegle for a week or so at one point, just because conversations could occasionally go to heights that were beyond hilarity. All in all I haven't used social networking much at school, but I'm coming to use it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out about science blogs (more specifically &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/" title=""&gt;scienceblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;) a few years ago... when my dad told me about them. That constant aspect of my knowledge has been embarrassing, but I still have to mention it. I guess I'll be looking more at Bora's blog now (I probably should have visited more of these right after the conference), and in the past my dad's talked about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/" title=""&gt;Uncertain Principles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/" title=""&gt;Not Even Wrong&lt;/a&gt; the former is on SB, the latter is the first result of a Google search). So far, I've liked things each of these blogs brings to the table. It's a small number I know right now, and each of them has pretty much equally grabbed my attention (although I don't, again, actually use scientific networking too much right now-- blasphemer!). At the conference itself, it wasn't so much an issue of finding any new blogs, but of actually remembering the names of some of them from the endless tide. I haven't, but I do now have the luxury of combing through the interviews Bora's conducting (I only knew they existed a few weeks ago when- surprise- my dad told me he had been contacted about my interview). I do plan on checking these out in more detail at the end of the summer though, because the variety of information looks interesting to no end (I'll have little, if any, access to the Internet for the coming month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading, blog-writing and whatever else you may be doing over the course of your life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with finding blogs, it isn't so much an issue of if I found anything, but if I could remember even half of all the things I thought would be useful knowledge for later. I had been advised to take notes in each session (I won't even bother saying who gave that advice now), and those notes should still be somewhere in the house. One thing that had been discussed in the conference that I am actively annoyed about because I can't remember it clearly (although I don't think it was a simple construct) was how some open-source projects do actually make money for the people behind them, such as &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/index.php" title=""&gt;PLoS&lt;/a&gt;. This actually seems a bit relevant to what I want to do for a living later: I would like to work in the public domain, and one would just have to take my word for it that I'm thinking of that because even if the pay isn't phenomenal, the goal would be to work somewhat out of goodwill as well as the quest for capital, and I'll get epic job stability if I work at a university, for a while, and do very well. The conference further inspired me to take a look at what I actually want to work toward when I go to work, not only pulling in money for food and shelter (again, if I end up with a 'real job', which I'm still hoping for), but actually providing something useful to the people I'm working for. Going into open-source, copyleft (I found that word out recently and wherever I did, I regret not being able to give that person credit) and the sort would presumably indicate the person going into it has good intentions. They may also be taking the high road solely to impress people, say they did, or for some other selfish reason, but everyone reading can only take my word on it that those aren't the only things I'm thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also reinforced at the conference that there's a lot to be critical of in the world of science, and that one has to look patiently and carefully at where 'something' (a tool, a database, etc.) comes from, how it's used, who's using it, how it's turning out, etc. to find out whether or not it's doing what it was designed to do (or at least that it's being used ethically-- I have to credit a lot of what I remember to &lt;a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/" title=""&gt;Bjoern&lt;/a&gt;). Every time I go to a conference like this one (I have been to a couple), it shows me more of the complexity and inner workings of scientific establishments, both their good sides and bad. Further, it makes me interested in examining them even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you and everyone else (I knew of) again too (and many more)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then last night I heard it at the gym while I was &lt;a href="http://www.spinning.com/spinning-enthusiasts/default.asp"&gt;spinning&lt;/a&gt; and, I have to say, it might be growing on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Hi dearie,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to my iPod on shuffle during my run on Saturday and re-discovered one of my favorite songs from a few years ago, that I used to listen to on repeat with the volume turned way up while driving to work. I realize it's kind of old now but you may still enjoy it. :)&lt;/p&gt;

So many things happen within our Cosmos on scales both grand and miniscule that humans confined to earth are only able to experience first hand the merest smattering of cosmological events. One of the more captivating cosmological events is when Earth’s moon lines up in the direct path of the Sun, causing a total solar eclipse. Total solar eclipses occur about once every two years, and it is only a very tiny sliver of the earth that gets to bathe in the full shadow of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="solareclipse2009jul22-s1" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/solareclipse2009jul22-s1.jpg" alt="solareclipse2009jul22-s1" width="320" height="270"&gt;&lt;a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEmono/TSE2009/TSE2009.html"&gt;The total solar eclipse of July 22, 2009&lt;/a&gt; was special in that it lasted almost 7 minutes at the center point of the eclipse’s narrow path, making it the longest total solar eclipse that will occur this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eclipse was not so special in that this relatively simply explained astronomical occurrence has brought out throngs of people that are intent on stepping on the shoulders of science so they can scream more loudly to spew their pseudoscience and nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090722/ap_on_re_as/as_asia_eclipse"&gt;The Associated Press reported&lt;/a&gt; that Indian astrologers predicted surges in violence, anti-social behavior, and health risks the day prior to the eclipse. From the article…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian astrologers are predicting violence and turmoil across the world as a result of this week’s total solar eclipse, which the superstitious and religious view as a sign of potential doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women are advised to stay indoors to prevent their babies developing birth defects, while prayers, fasting and ritual bathing, particularly in holy rivers, are encouraged. Shivani Sachdev Gour, a gynaecologist at the Fortis Hospital in New Delhi, said a number of expectant mothers scheduled for caesarian deliveries on July 22 had asked to change the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mother and aunts have called and told me stay in a darkened room with the curtains closed, lie in bed and chant prayers,” Krati Jain, 24, who is expecting her first child, said in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a belief deeply rooted in Indian society. Couples are willing to do anything to ensure that the baby is not born on that day,” Gour said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from the article, here is the nugget from the local skeptic …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association, dismissed such doomsday predictions. “Primarily, what we see with all these soothsayers and astrologers is that they’re looking for opportunities to enhance their business with predictions of danger and calamity,” he told AFP. “They have been very powerful in India but over the last decade they have been in systematic decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am not up to speed on the trends of astrology in India, I am somewhat skeptical of Mr. Edamuruku’s sentiment. Systematic decline would suggest that the pieces of society responsible to harnessing the belief in astrology are being taken apart. Astrology might wax and wane from time to time, but it never disappears. Based on its longevity and resilience, and despite the centuries of science putting to rest all the astrological arguments, astrology is still a force of ignorance to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the eclipse, things were not all that better in other parts of Asia, where people ran for cover and prayer to avert themselves from the dangers of the moon’s shadow. AP reported that in China…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a Buddhist temple in the Thai capital Bangkok, dozens of monks led a mass prayer at a Buddhist temple to ward off evil. “The eclipse is bad omen for the country,” said Pinyo Pongjaroen, a prominent astrologer. “We are praying to boost the fortune of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Myanmar …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddhists went to Yangon’s famed Shwedagon pagoda to offer flowers, fruits and water to ward off misfortune. Some warned their friends and family not to sleep through the eclipse for fear of getting bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Japan …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sky turned dark like in the dead of the night. The air turned cooler and cicadas stopped singing. Everything was so exciting and moving,” Fukumitsu said. “It was rather mysterious,” he said. “It must have been a frightening experience for people hundreds of years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just hundreds of years ago, Mr. Fukumitsu, hundreds of minutes ago too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not to be outdone by mainstream media, the folks at the always-reliable &lt;a href="http://www.astrodispatch.com/2009/07/21/new-moon-solar-eclipse-mayan-alignments-china-and-scopes-for-all-signs/"&gt;astrodispatch.com&lt;/a&gt; website offer their cogent thoughts on the eclipse …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a great deal of transformational velocity accruing and accumulating with the onset of the new moon and the centuries most potent solar eclipse. The Moon is completely new in Cancer, just a day before the solar eclipse, almost ready to phase shift into Leo, peaking at 30 degrees Cancer. The lunar magnetism has reached it’s full potency, it’s zenith, it’s full pull upon psyches and inner landscapes. In the Arguelles count of The Mayan calendar, this day falls under 12 Cauac, the second to last day of the Mayan calendar falls under 12 Cauac, the second to last day of the Mayan calendar, which falls neatly on the day of the solar eclipse. Both days are incredibly auspicious. The 21st is a day of cleansing, activation, catalyzing and clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code according to Arguelles for 12 Cauac:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Crystal Storm&lt;br&gt;
- I Dedicate in order to Catalyse&lt;br&gt;
- Universalizing Energy&lt;br&gt;
- I seal the Matrix of Self-generation&lt;br&gt;
- With the Crystal tone of Cooperation&lt;br&gt;
- I am guided by the power of Magic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new noon will dissolve obdurate inner order, calcified by entropy and habit. Here’s a little new age wisdom for you; “Go with the flow.” Surrender and let the wisdom of silence guide you into greater pathways of psychic navigation. Open to channels of direct experience, Trust what you know and you‘ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an awful lot of gobbledygook, claptrap, and inane babble to get to the point, which is ultimately correct … you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248703961641"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14202">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6d7ee24fc50b0fb8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Damn, It Feels Good to be a Christian</title><published>2009-07-27T14:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T14:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/27/damn-it-feels-good-to-be-a-christian/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m reading a new book called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470497246?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0470497246"&gt;Intersections of Religious Privilege: Difficult Dialogues and Student Affairs Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  It’s the theme for the 125&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; installment of the Jossey-Bass quarterly report series &lt;em&gt;New Directions for Student Services&lt;/em&gt; — that is to say, it’s a collection of academic papers on a particular topic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, I stay away from reading those because… well… they bore me to tears.  In this case, though, the focus is religion (and atheism) on college campuses, so I was intrigued.  Specifically, it’s about how faculty members and staffers can better understand students’ religious beliefs and how they can start positive dialogue with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One paper included in this collection &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/02/07/supporting-the-inclusion-of-atheists-on-campus/"&gt;deals with atheist students&lt;/a&gt;.  Since I posted about that paper a while back, I won’t say any more about it here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I wanted to mention an essay by &lt;strong&gt;Ellen E. Fairchild&lt;/strong&gt; which discusses “Christian privilege” — benefits that Christians get in our society that are denied to the rest of us — despite our nation’s separation of church and state.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairchild cites a list created by &lt;strong&gt;L.Z. Schlosser&lt;/strong&gt; in 2003.  Look at the perks you get for being a Christian in our society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that state and federal holidays coincide with my religious practices, thereby having little to no impact on my job and/or education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When told about the history of civilization, I can be sure that I am shown people of my religion made it what it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I probably do not need to learn the religious or spiritual customs of others, and I am likely not penalized for not knowing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am probably unencumbered by having to explain why I am or am not doing things related to my religious norms on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that mass media represents my religion widely AND positively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that I can find items to buy that represent my religious norms and holidays with relative ease (e.g., food, decorations, greeting cards, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My religious holidays are so completely “normal” that, in many ways, they may appear to no longer have religious significance at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can openly display my religious symbol(s) on my person or property without fear of disapproval, violence, and/or vandalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that most members of Congress believe as you do, and they sometimes legislate accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other items you would add to the list?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those benefits all contribute to this false belief that we are a Christian nation.  With all that in mind, it takes a lot of work for an administrator to make non-Christians feel included.  The rest of the paper explains how we can challenge this “Christian nation” idea and instead celebrate our nation’s &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-reading that list, some of the items are unfathomable to me.  Growing up as a Jain, none of them were true.  I was always the outsider.  I imagine if I were a Jain today, it would only be worse because I would notice the differences much more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any control over what pastors say in church, but I think it would be very powerful if a pastor said this to his congregation: &lt;em&gt;What if you [Christians] lived in a society where Jews were the privileged ones?  Or Muslims?  Or atheists?  What would you feel like?  What would government look like?  What would change in your life?  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After considering all this, how are you going to change the way you deal with people of other faiths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if any Christian pastors would be willing to challenge their congregations with such an idea…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was dismayed because Maher has championed pseudoscience, including &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/03/is-bill-maher-really-that-ignorant_07.html"&gt;dangerous antivaccine nonsense&lt;/a&gt;, germ theory denialism complete with &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/03/idiot_week.html"&gt;repeating myths about Louis Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; supposedly recanting on his deathbed, a &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/12/bill-maher-anti-vax-wingnut.html"&gt;hostility towards "Western medicine"&lt;/a&gt; and an affinity for "alternative medicine," a history of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/bill_maher_on_christine_maggiores_book.php"&gt;sympathy to HIV/AIDS denialists&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/bill_maher_antivaccination_wingnut.php"&gt;activities of PETA&lt;/a&gt; through his position on its board of directors, all facts that led me to liken his receiving the Richard Dawkins Award to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php"&gt;giving an award for public health to Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. I was not alone, either. &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/richard-dawkins-award-goes-to-bill.html"&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheist-alliance-international-epic.html"&gt;Matt D.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/they-gave-bill-maher-the-richard-dawkins-award"&gt;Skepacabra&lt;/a&gt; agreed with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wrote that post, I expected some pushback, and I hadn't really expected to be writing any followup posts. After all, to my surprise P.Z. Myer's defense of the decision was tepid at best, and the strongest he could come up with was to urge attendees to the AAI convention to "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/put_maher_in_the_hot_seat.php"&gt;put Maher in the hot seat&lt;/a&gt;." Then over the weekend I noticed that someone unexpected took me to task. Not just took me to task, but lambasted me. Normally, I don't know if I would have bothered to respond or not, but this criticism came from someone I normally like and respect. Worse, the arguments were shockingly weak compared to his usual posts. Given that, I felt he deserved at least a brief reply (except that this is Orac we're talking about and "brief" is not really in his vocabulary). I'm referring, of course, to Jason Rosenhouse, who thinks that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/07/bill_maher_is_a_fine_choice_fo.php"&gt;Bill Maher is a a fine choice for the Richard Dawkins Award&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_and_anti-science.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_and_anti-science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/dds_83LyRvc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248703035743"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8499">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7278fa219652847a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 7.27</title><published>2009-07-27T13:00:15Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T13:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8499" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

I'm fortunate in that I have always been able to take libraries for granted. I feel at home in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to read at age four or five, I may have been taken about that time to some forgotten library in Greenwich, Conn. But the first one I remember and one of the two most important ones in my life so far is Saltsjöbaden public library, located at the Dump, &lt;i&gt;Tippen&lt;/i&gt;, the local mall which took its name from being built on the site of a former dump. My mom took me to the Dump library at age six and got me a library card, and then for years helped transport loads and loads of books between the Dump and our home. An early favourite of mine was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/A.%20Philippa%20Pearce"&gt;Philippa Pearce&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;i&gt;Minnow on the Say&lt;/i&gt;. And there was Irmelin Sandman Lilius, Tove Jansson, and as I grew older, Hans-Eric Hellberg, J.R.R. Tolkien, and more and more &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/11/science_fiction_is_where_im_fr.php"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; such as Robert A. Heinlein, Clifford Simak and Arthur C. Clarke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From age twelve to eighteen me and my geek friends spent most of our recesses in the library of Saltsjöbaden &lt;i&gt;samskola&lt;/i&gt; ("co-ed school", a designation that had by that time of course long been meaningless). We flipped through magazines, read 17th century poetry for the funny spelling, played &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetrack_(game)"&gt;Vector Race&lt;/a&gt;, wrote absurd poetry and chatted with the punk chicks. I don't remember finding many good books on the shelves, but a friendly high-school senior had a huge impact on me right at the start by simply lending me a grocery bag full of American paperbacks just when I'd run out of fantasy in Swedish: Raymond Feist, David Eddings, Fritz Leiber, Roger Zelazny, Piers Anthony. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my early twenties I was even an amateur librarian, being head of the Stockholm Tolkien Society's book guild and caretaker of its fantasy library. "Library" is &lt;i&gt;bibliotek&lt;/i&gt; in Swedish, and so of course I named the library &lt;i&gt;Bilboteket&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second really important library in my life is the Library of the Royal Academy of Letters, one of Scandinavia's largest research libraries for archaeology and adjacent disciplines. I've used it regularly for almost two decades, and getting any work done there is somewhat complicated by my tendency to run into people I know. On my way to &lt;i&gt;Vitterheten&lt;/i&gt; I always buy cake enough for at least two people, as there's invariably someone to share with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another library where I have always found it hard to concentrate is the Stockholm University Library. There are simply way, way too many pretty girls there. And though I pass by the Royal Library every Monday on my way to work at the Academy, I only use it on the rare occasions when I need a book that's not available at the Academy's library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my local, Fisksätra public library, I mainly interact in two ways: I frequently donate books and magazines, and I collect the inter-library loans I sometimes order over the internet there. But I never read there. It's close to home, and they don't have many books I want to read: I care little for Swedish novels, the Anglophone ones they carry are mainly in translation which I avoid, and for reference purposes I use the net.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/my_libraries.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/Yw1L26P1CFU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248702615432"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4340">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91d6ebb1e8f632c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="ID/Creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="dembski" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Dembski"/><category term="globalwarming" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Global warming"/><category term="intelligentdesign" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="intelligent design"/><title type="html">It&amp;#39;s all about Science Envy</title><published>2009-07-27T13:41:32Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T13:45:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/its-all-about-s.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows of the Discovery Institute seem to be over represented in fringe groups, Paul Nelson is a Young Earth Creationist, the Godfather of Intelligent Design Phillip Johnson and DI fellow Jonathan C. Wells have &lt;a href="http://aras.ab.ca/rethinkers.php" rel="external "&gt;signed on to AIDS denial&lt;/a&gt; and Guillermo Gonzalez has signed on to a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/12/inhofe_less_honest_than_the_di.php" rel="external "&gt;climate change denialist list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topically, given the debate about science communication that has been happening in the wake of of “&lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2009/07/unscientific-america-and-case-of-pluto.html" rel="external "&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/a&gt;”, in a &lt;a href="http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/BPFirstPerson.asp?ID=30950" rel="external "&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; William Dembski dives into the whole Global Warming Denialism thing [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, at that same time in the 1970s, scientists were concerned not that the earth was warming but that it was cooling. The scare back then was global cooling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately for Dr. Dembski, this is&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11643" rel="external "&gt; a complete myth&lt;/a&gt;. There was no &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/03/the-global-cooling-mole/" rel="external "&gt;global cooling scare&lt;/a&gt; in the 70’s. While this is an indication of the level of fact checking involved in the article, more important is the subtext in this article, which makes more clear than ever the real concern of the Intelligent Design movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the naked, unadulterated envy (and fear)  of the power of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holdren nevertheless represents the powerful new caste of scientists who have appointed themselves the guardians of humanity and the priests of a new social order. …. Their strategy is always the same: Scientists have discovered a problem that, as their models and data (often falsely) demonstrate, is on the verge of getting out of control; now, if only we do exactly as they say, we’ll avoid catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stand in awe at the power of us scientists, we only have to use big words, show lots of data, click our fingers and politicians will um, er, well .….  &lt;a href="http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40401" rel="external "&gt;ignore us actually&lt;/a&gt; (see also&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/24/science/earth/24deny.html?_r=1&amp;amp;amp;emc=eta1" rel="external "&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;). Until real disaster actually does strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take air pollution: Scientists had been pointing out the issues with air pollution for years, but nothing really started getting underway until the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog_of_1952" rel="external "&gt;killer smogs hit London&lt;/a&gt;. With&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#History" rel="external "&gt; acid rain&lt;/a&gt;, it was only after large swaths of forests began dying and lakes became sterile did anybody actually take action on scientists warnings. Collapsing fisheries? Scientists keep on warning about the consequences of overfishing but people tend to take notice only after a fishery has collapsed, and then don’t even put in decent fishing controls. Ozone hole? Despite well researched chemistry no one really listened until the &lt;a href="http://www.theozonehole.com/ozoneholehistory.htm" rel="external "&gt;ozone hole&lt;/a&gt; appeared over the Antarctic, then they &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;scurried&lt;/span&gt; moved sluggishly, until finally we have bans on most ozone destroying CFC’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true pattern is that scientists find an important issue, back it up with careful research, and have to fight persistently to get governments, businesses and the general public to take notice. Global warming is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the scientific priesthood is telling us that the earth faces catastrophe if we don’t mend our carbon-emitting ways and do everything we can to prevent global warming (“cap and trade” is only the beginning). …. In any case, the pattern is always the same: Find a problem, catastrophize it and make scientists the saviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to George Marshal (New Scientist, 25 July 2009, page 24), it has taken 44 years of research that cost around $3 billion dollars per year, plus symposia conferences, journal articles, popular articles, documentaries and innumerable internet postings to ahh, convince politicians to &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2620846.htm" rel="external "&gt;come together and procrastinate&lt;/a&gt;.  And still 40% of the UK population and over 50% of the US populations do not accept that human greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate WWMAKD [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, scientists, feel our power, tremble at our might (that was sarcasm, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even this weak, pathetic shadow of power that we do have provokes Dr. Dembski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; But isn’t science our best, most reliable form of knowledge, and shouldn’t we therefore defer to scientists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are as fallible as the rest of us, as are their scientific theories. Indeed, the history of science is filled with failed scientific theories that once were confidently asserted and now have been radically modified or even abandoned &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, naughty, naughty scientists; actually paying attention to evidence and modifying our theories in the light of actual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_%28physician%29" rel="external "&gt;John Snow&lt;/a&gt; closed down the Broad Street Pump the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease" rel="external "&gt;Germ theory of Disease&lt;/a&gt; was only just being devised. It would be significantly changed and revised multiple times before being properly formulated by Koch, and would keep on being revised multiple times since then (viruses and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion" rel="external "&gt;prions&lt;/a&gt; being new additions to the fold). Despite the deficiencies of the germ theory at the time, Snows actions lead to sewage and clean water works that would save millions from disease, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister" rel="external "&gt;Lister’s work&lt;/a&gt; would revolutionise surgery, and Koch would revolutionise medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should we have not put in sewerage works or ignored antiseptics until the germ theory of disease was in its modern form?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is not perfect by any means, but if you want practical solutions to practical problems it is the only way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In claiming to find and then resolve problems that threaten to overwhelm humanity, they have invaded the political scene, commanding vast research moneys and attempting to force on the wider population government-sanctioned programs for social control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scientists, fear us, we will take your children and feed them the best available knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course science invades the political scene, if we want to reduce childhood deaths, prevent the spread of hepatitis C (let alone AIDS), respond to the spread of H1N1 (the flu formerly known as swine flu), slow the rise of antibacterial resistance by limiting antibiotic use in animal husbandry, make informed decisions on genetically modified foods, do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; which requires an evidence base, it will of course require science by its very nature (and involve politics because these things all involve governments at various levels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example is the response to HIV in Australia. The advent of HIV/AIDS in Australia resulted in an &lt;a href="http://ernreeders.com/HKS/CHRONOLOGYof%20HIV%20in%20Australia.pdf" rel="external "&gt;academic-grass roots collaboration&lt;/a&gt; which amongst other things brought about the execrable &lt;a href="http://video.aol.com/video-detail/grim-reaper-psa/3025795754" rel="external "&gt;“Death goes bowling&lt;/a&gt;” ad (but this played a huge role in raising AIDS awareness), testing of blood donations to prevent HIV contamination of blood stocks, the “&lt;a href="http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=135278&amp;amp;amp;search=HIV%2FAIDS&amp;amp;amp;site_id=3" rel="external "&gt;If it’s not on it’s not on&lt;/a&gt;” campaign, where giant condoms were plastered across buses and trams, needle exchange programs and safe needle disposal containers in public toilets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the sort of thing where science invades the political sphere, where we &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; it to invade the political sphere, and I have no doubt the Australian approach would have given Dr. Dembski a conniption fit. Certainly our approach was vigorously opposed by conservative politicians in the US. What are the results of this horrible, materialist, evidence based approach? Australia has a &lt;a href="http://www.avert.org/aids-hiv-australia.htm" rel="external "&gt;AIDS incidence&lt;/a&gt; of 0.9 per 100,000 population, over 10 times lower than that in the United States (12.8 per 100,000). And the last time I looked, Australia wasn’t markedly more decadent that the US. How dare we scientists save lives without corrupting youth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, what does Dembski think we should do when forming policies, consult sheep entrails? The whole article reeks of fear and envy of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the “vast research moneys”? The US military budget for 2006 was $527 billion, the NIH was around $30 billion and the National Science Foundation was around $6 billion in 2006, of which only $4 billion goes for research (2006 data as it was the only comparable data I could find at short notice). That may sound a lot, but the US had roughly 1.2 million researchers in 2006, so that money has to be spread over a lot of programs, from computing to polar science. The average NSF grant size is $140,000 which covers research costs, salaries, on costs etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay our soccer players more. Heck, to put this in perspective, Melbourne just spent &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/melbournes-240000-makeover-20090722-dt0o.html" rel="external "&gt;$240,000 on a new logo&lt;/a&gt;. Vast research moneys? Ha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some large collaborative projects will be funded to well over a million dollars (Large Hadron Collider or Human Genome project anyone?). But again, in terms of global warming, this goes for things like researchers salaries to actually do work, satellite data costs, sending out boats and so on to collect data, sample collection, preparation and analysis and computer time for data reduction. While this may be more money than Dembski will ever see as a philosopher, this is because scientists actually &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; stuff. Somebody actually has to go and drill ice cores then count the ice layers and extract gases and measure their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insofar as they are trying to influence the public square, they need to explain themselves in plain English and they need to allow fair discussion and open dissent. Plenty of qualified scientists dispute that humans are significantly contributing to global warming or that extreme counter-measures are necessary. But the scientific priesthood quashes all such dissent, marginalizing and even persecuting those who don’t toe the party line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ohhh, Scientists use big words! Scary! Dembski also trots out the “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/12/inhofe_less_honest_than_the_di.php" rel="external "&gt;lots of scientists dissent&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2007/08/classifying_abstracts_on_globa.php" rel="external "&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; and the “big science quashes debate” myth. Bjørn Lomborg has &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/03/sea_level_rise_a_red_herring.php" rel="external "&gt;such a hard time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; getting heard, I should be so persecuted. Here in Australia, any Global Warming Denier gets a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/06/the_australians_war_on_science_40.php" rel="external "&gt;free ride&lt;/a&gt; in the national newspaper The Australian, no matter how loony, but real climate scientists are ignored. How’s that for power?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, scientists would be chuffed if we had a thousandth of the power that Dembski ascribes to us. Any gains we make in any area of public policy, from global warming, to safe limits for pollutants, to effective public health practices, is a hard slog which first involves lots of hard data, and then convincing people at various levels in Government and Industry that things are serious. Long hard slogs, always starting with the evidence. And, in most cases, both government and Industry and other stakeholders are sympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists are not our masters. They are our servants, and they need a lesson in humility. It is up to us – We the People – to hold their feet to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/the-vise-strategy-squeezing-the-truth-out-of-darwinists/" rel="external "&gt;power fantasy&lt;/a&gt; from Dembski.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the vast overrating of scientists power by Dembski, scientists &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; influence policy, because we have &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt;. And this is what Dembski envies and fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] WWMAKD What would Mooney and Kirshenbaum do. Chris and Sheril claim we scientists need to get out and communicate more. However, despite innumerable public talks, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/06/there_are_two_types_of_scienti.php" rel="external "&gt;freely available websites&lt;/a&gt;, IPCC downloadable reports, debates, documentaries, newspaper and magazine articles it’s hard to see what scientists could do to make the science of climate change simpler and easier to understand. For example, tomorrow Professor Barry Brook, the  Director of Climate Science at The Environment Institute, University of Adelaide, will &lt;a href="http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/07/27/the-great-climate-debate-2009-brook-vs-plimer/" rel="external "&gt;debate Climate Change Denier Ian Pilmer&lt;/a&gt;. Barry has  has published two books and regularly writes opinion pieces and popular articles for the media as well as talking to a variety of community groups (I’ve heard him talk, he’s great!). Yet ignorance on the topic abounds. What more can he do? Suggestions Chris and Sheril please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the Manam volcano in Papua New Guinea, &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=39248"&gt;as imaged by NASA’s Earth Observing-1 satellite&lt;/a&gt; (and you can also &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/39000/39248/manam_ali_2009179_lrg.jpg"&gt;download a ginormously embiggened version&lt;/a&gt;, too). In late June the volcano had a minor eruption, captured by the orbiting camera. You can see several older pyroclastic flow beds, where previous eruptions spewed out viciously hot rocks, gas, and ash which roared down the slope of the volcano to the sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images like this, especially when taken over long periods of time to show changes in the landscape, help scientists understand just how these volcanoes work. That can lead to better predictive power, and that can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say the space program is a waste of money. Perhaps they forget that we sometimes point our advanced equipment back at ourselves, to learn more about the planet we call home. And if they still gripe, perhaps we can remind them that this particular satellite cost each person in the U.S. just a few pennies; how much do they think the thrill of seeing such a gorgeous picture of Manam &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; cost… even if it had no scientific value at all?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248701545707"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/another_review_of_unscientific.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/232860f0dc1f8a15</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Another review of Unscientific America</title><published>2009-07-27T14:05:02Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T14:05:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/l-Q-3zaGRkM/another_review_of_unscientific.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/another_review_of_unscientific.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As is his habit, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/07/reviewing_unscientific_america.php"&gt;Jason Rosenhouse has begun a long review&lt;/a&gt; of Mooney and Kirshenbaum&amp;#39;s book.

&lt;p&gt;I know Mooney has the ability to put together a solid story, as he showed in &lt;i&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Storm World&lt;/i&gt; — it&amp;#39;s too bad he chose to go the shallow and substanceless route in this book.

It's strong stuff; he points out that Collins isn't just a Christian, he's an active science-denier who has set aside whole blocks of scientific inquiry as inaccessible to study because they are a product of a divine being. As he asks at the end, "Must we really entrust the future of biomedical research in the United States to a man who sincerely believes that a scientific understanding of human nature is impossible?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest part of the essay, in my opinion, was that Harris directly quotes Collins' own words, and they are not encouraging. Most specifically, he includes the text of slides from a talk Collins gave at UC Berkeley in 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1: "Almighty God, who is not limited in space or time, created a universe 13.7 billion years ago with its parameters precisely tuned to allow the development of complexity over long periods of time."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Slide 2: "God's plan included the mechanism of evolution to create the marvelous diversity of living things on our planet. Most especially, that creative plan included human beings."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Slide 3: "After evolution had prepared a sufficiently advanced 'house' (the human brain), God gifted humanity with the knowledge of good and evil (the moral law), with free will, and with an immortal soul."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Slide 4: "We humans used our free will to break the moral law, leading to our estrangement from God. For Christians, Jesus is the solution to that estrangement."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Slide 5: "If the moral law is just a side effect of evolution, then there is no such thing as good or evil. It's all an illusion. We've been hoodwinked. Are any of us, especially the strong atheists, really prepared to live our lives within that worldview?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My jaw just dropped when I read that. It is breathtakingly vacuous. How does Francis Collins know any of that? Those conclusions are not anything we could draw from any scientific evidence, and there's the head of the human genome project throwing around quaint Christian dogma as if it were reasonable and valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one really irritates, too — it&amp;#39;s the familiar anti-atheist canard that atheists cannot know any truly moral behavior, that the only genuine sense of morality arises out of obedience to an authority, &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; an invisible but omnipotent authority. Collins is a man who does not trust the godless people in his communities because, to his mind, they are blind to good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know evil when I see it. A priest taking advantage of his presumed moral authority to take young boys into the dark and private rooms of his church to rape them is evil, I think. Not because a god has whispered a rule into my head, but because I know that the successful relationships that build a cooperative network within the framework of my society are all formed on mutual trust, and that is a violation. We test these bonds of mutual support all the time, we rely on them, and we know from history that their loss contributes to social decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also contain biological imperatives that strengthen those bonds. We know good when we see it, too: kindness, self-sacrifice, and charity move us, not because we are ordered to do so by an imaginary god, but because we can feel empathy for others, and yes, evolution has shaped individuals to respond with affirmation to actions that reinforce the community. That's how we survive and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to turn Collins' statement around against him. If god does not exist, if religion is a byproduct of the evolution of the mind, then there is no reason to obey him. It's all an illusion. You've been hoodwinked. Are you devout Christians really prepared to live your lives in reality? And if you aren't, why should we trust you in positions of power?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/sam_harris_on_collins_appointm.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/nv6W57l0DG4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248701067545"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/some-more-words-to-the-new-atheist-blogosphere-on-unscientific-america/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90de034dbba6532e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Religion"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">Some More Words to the New Atheist Blogosphere on Unscientific America</title><published>2009-07-27T13:03:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T13:03:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/some-more-words-to-the-new-atheist-blogosphere-on-unscientific-america/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the two of us grapple with a book tour, other book projects, cross-country moves, and much else, we’ve been pretty hamstrung in our online replies to the “New Atheists.” So this post will try to make up a bit of that slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset, let us say that we always knew &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; would be controversial. Indeed, we’re glad it has touched such a nerve in some quarters—to us, this underscores that its critique was much needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 8 of &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;—just 12 pages of a broader book–we argue that an entire movement attached to “science” today is not really much invested in effectively reaching the U.S. public, but rather, has become radicalized around the counterproductive project of blasting other Americans’ religious faith. This movement is most vociferous on the Internet and, more particularly, on science blogs like Pharyngula, where its adherents seem unswervingly certain their way is the right way, and seem to little value civil dialogue with those who might disagree. (For one seconding of this opinion, see &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/blog/2040-inviting-refugees-infighting-science-blogs-23380.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that one point of &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; is that this entire “dialogue” is not constructive, but rather &lt;em&gt;destructive&lt;/em&gt;—not conducive to reason, nor to advancing the place of science in our society—it should come as no surprise that we do not keep up with it as much as many others do. This partly explains why we haven’t said much for a week or more, as does the fact that (as shown in our &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/07/26/why_dont_americans_understand_science_better_start_with_the_scientists/"&gt;recent Boston Globe article&lt;/a&gt;) there is much else in our book that we want to discuss besides the unending battle over science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we have had more mainstream media audiences, as well as public audiences at book events, to address. The response to the book in such venues is, as a rule, starkly different from the “New Atheist” response on the Internet–where the vast majority of our critics do not seem to have read the book. This, too, has made us hesitant to respond, as it seems very unlikely that what will result is an informed, dispassionate, or civil debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are some things that should probably be answered, at least in brief. Unfortunately, even some New Atheists who have read the book are reacting to it in a way we can scarcely comprehend–with a case in point being Jerry Coyne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several months, Chris tried to engage in a civil debate with Dr. Coyne about the merits of “accommodationism.” There was some progress, perhaps, but nothing like what might have been accomplished in a simple in-person debate or discussion. Still, Chris hoped Coyne would give &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; a fair reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became concerned a few weeks back, though, after &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/10/eugenie-scott-powerfully-makes-the-case-for-science-religion-compatibility/"&gt;posting (along with a few supporting words) a video of Eugenie Scott&lt;/a&gt; talking about science-religion compatibility. Merely for posting this video, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/eugenie-scott-dissembles-about-accommodationism/"&gt;Coyne accused Chris&lt;/a&gt; of “dissembling” and “using authority arguments.” Scott was also accused of dissembling—simply for making an argument she believes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Coyne &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/unscientific-unscientific-america-part-1/"&gt;began to review our book&lt;/a&gt;, and strongly misstated our views. While we won’t respond to him on every detail, we’ll make a few remarks to underscore the nature of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take something like this from Coyne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where does the problem come from? In an earlier book, The Republican War on Science, Mooney laid it largely at the door of political conservatives.  But, say M&amp;amp;K, we now have another enemy: the scientists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re baffled anyone could read us this way. The scientists are our heroes. Granted, we talk in the book about how they have not always invested adequately in communication, and we call for a change of mindset and of culture in this respect—but to claim that we depict them as the “enemy” boggles the mind. If that was the case, then why are our audiences full of scientists–wanting to hear how they can be part of the &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Rosenau has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2009/07/do_i_repeat_myself_very_well_t.php"&gt;dealt with&lt;/a&gt; another of Coyne’s critiques, his assertion that he could find “little in &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; that has not been said, at length, elsewhere.” Well, this is a popular book that synthesizes much past work (and cites it extensively); what’s probably most new is the nature of the synthesis. As Rosenau notes, our book is not unlike many popular books in this respect–including many recent books about evolution and atheism. (It is not like there are many “new” arguments for atheism out there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Coyne continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what is new—the accusation that scientists, in particular atheist-scientists, are largely responsible for scientific illiteracy—is asserted without proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re stunned anyone could read our book this way–and saddened anyone would seriously think we’re making such an obviously incorrect argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we describe it, scientific illiteracy—really, the gap between science and society–is a complex, multi-faceted, multi-decadal problem. As such, the idea that the “New Atheist” movement of the last few years could have &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; it is incomprehensible to us. Not only do we not think this, but we cannot comprehend how &lt;em&gt;anyone &lt;/em&gt;could think this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present moment, the “New Atheists” may be counterproductive, and may divert resources and energies that might be far better used elsewhere. The movement may also have the effect of making our society more, rather than less, polarized around science–of adding fuel to a longstanding and fruitless culture war with science trapped in the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think these things are true. But they’re vastly different from blaming the “New Atheists” for decades of problems they weren’t even around for–at least not in their current form. And we even say this directly in the book: “Of course, the New Atheists aren’t the &lt;em&gt;origin &lt;/em&gt;of the cleft between religious and scientific culture in America–they’re more like a reaction to it” (p. 98).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we actually claim in &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; is that longstanding habits of disengagement from the public, on the part of the scientific community, have &lt;em&gt;contributed&lt;/em&gt; to the science-society gap that we now have. But such disengagement is only one contributing factor, and there are gobs of others listed and discussed in the book: political cynicism, public ignorance and anti-intellectualism, a poor educational system, media inaccuracy and irresponsibility, entertainment stereotyping, religious dogma, and so on. Scientists are only one part of this mix, but a key point of the book is that they are a &lt;em&gt;crucial&lt;/em&gt; part of it. For too long, some scientists have pointed the finger at others–journalists, educators, and so on, and often with good reason–yet have not looked adequately at themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, ours is a vastly different and more nuanced argument than the one Coyne limns. Were we to go through his full review and respond on every point, you would just hear us stating over and over again this observation. There are some aspects to his critique that are thoughtful, but in saddling us with weak arguments that we do not hold (and so cannot possibly defend), Coyne is not fairly measuring our book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we see PZ Myers has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/solution_blame_scientists_add.php"&gt;decided to comment on us again&lt;/a&gt;, and misrepresents our arguments even more than does Coyne: “Their explanation for scientific illiteracy in America is simple: it’s the scientists’ fault for being so aloof and distant.” As just explained, this is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Myers &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t seem to want people to read our book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will say one good thing about their op-ed, though. It contains the full content of their entire book. Read the essay, now you don’t need to buy the book, since it covers it fully, including all the non-existent details for how to actually implement their solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a better suggestion: If you are interested in this matter, then read the book, read all the critics, and make up your own mind. Isn’t that what a freethinker, a practitioner of reason, would do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our part, we believe the blog-based “New Atheist” reaction to the book simply reinforces &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;’s critique. This movement on the Internet–motivated not so much by science as by culture war instincts, and sadly, showing far too little investment in civil dialogue—isn’t helping us build a better relationship between science and American society.&lt;/p&gt;

The person in the passenger’s seat swears he knows which way to turn, but the GPS unit in your car tells you to go the opposite direction. Problematic. Indeed, possibly relationship-changing depending on who’s in the passenger seat.

Still, humans generally have it easy when it comes to navigating. Our decisions are usually “turn left” or “turn right.” We are close to flatlanders when we are moving around our environment. Animals animals that fly, climb, or swim have to take the vertical dimension into account when getting around much more than humans do....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

(The link is below.)  The slides are taken from a Berkeley lecture in which Collins aims to break down the walls between science and spirituality, areas that he says should not be “walled off” from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching this talk (it’s about an hour long, starting at 6:00 and ending at 1:13:00, with the beginning and end occupied by introductions and questions, respectively), I am more certain than ever that Collins really does pollute his science with his faith. By speaking with the authority of a scientist, by discussing science at length, and above all by describing in the same talk the evidence for evolution and the “evidence” for God, acting as if they are of similar epistemic significance, he is confusing his audiences about the nature of evidence and the nature of science. (See his comment at 51:30 that “My role here is to tell you what I as a scientist and a believer have learned about science and what I have learned about my belief in the context of that and vice versa.”) It’s a disquieting performance, even more distressing because Collins is an affable and genial speaker, conveying his snake oil is with a dose of sugar.  And it’s scary (but not incomprehensible) to see how a smart man has managed to convince himself of a set of superstitions that are completely unsupported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I dissect his arguments, let me give Collins credit for one thing: he isn’t a straight-up wackaloon creationist.  He recognizes that intelligent design is not science, and gives some arguments against it. He doesn’t do nearly as good a job as Kenneth Miller, but at least he tries, and that’s good. But then he undercuts the whole business by proclaiming that the evidence points to the hand of God on the tiller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to avoid having to watch the whole megillah, scroll forward until about 27 minutes in, when Collins starts laying out the “questions” that science cannot answer, e.g., What happens after I die? Is there a god?. Of course the implication is that faith can answer them, but he’s wrong.  How can faith tell us what happens after we die?  Do our bodies get taken to heaven? If so, do we show up with our bodies at the age at which we died, or as an infant, or as something in between?  If we’re cremated, do we appear before St. Peter as a cinder?  How can we tell for sure that we’re not going to be boiled in molten sulfur for eternity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole tenor of Collins’s argument is that his acceptance of God &lt;em&gt;is based on empirical evidence&lt;/em&gt;. In this sense he puts it on the same plane as his science, and this is the pollution that has always troubled me.  (Look at Collins’s five slides, highlighted by Sam Harris, and see if they don’t look like flat assertions about reality.) Collins begins laying out the “evidence” for God at 28:39.  It is, briefly, this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  There is something instead of nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that prove there is a God? Physics tell us that something can indeed come from “nothing” (that is, the absence of matter).  The origin of the universe is of course a problem that physicists are still working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Mathematics is “unreasonably effective”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, how ineffective would it have to be before it didn’t point to God?  Didn’t Gödel show that it wasn’t perfect anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  The Universe was put together by a mathematical mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does he know this?  Why do regularities in the Universe testify to the existence of a celestial being? After all, isn’t the &lt;em&gt;suspension of regularities&lt;/em&gt; — that is, miracles — also taken as evidence for God? You can’t have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  The physical constants seem to have “precisely chosen values” that enable the existence and evolution of complexity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the word “chosen”, which assumes what the argument is trying to prove. There are, of course, numerous scientific theories for why the values are as they are (and they don’t appear so “precise,” anyway).  This work is in its early stages, and so Colllins is advancing a God-of-the-gaps argument — a form of argument that he pretends to abjure (see below).  Since we don’t understand why the “constants” of physics are as they are, says Collins, their “precision” must constitute evidence for God.  Note Collins’s assertion that scientific hypotheses like multiverses require &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; faith than do religious explanations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too, there are already good scientific explanations for “fine tuning,” including Lee Smolin’s hypothesis that new universes are constantly coming into being (the “multiverse” theory), and those whose physical constants allow them to last a long time will eventually, though a process analogous to natural selection, enrich the population of universes with those having “tuned” constants.  This is not a “desperation” or a “faith” move, as Collins implies; rather, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/15/what-questions-can-science-answer/#more-2444"&gt;as Sean Carroll has pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, multiverses are a natural prediction of some classes of physics theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Big Bang shows that the Universe had a beginning.  Therefore it must have had a creator; that creator would have to have been supernatural, and “that sounds like God.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for all the physicists who are trying to figure out how the universe could have arisen through natural causes.  Give up, folks — Collins says that he knows the answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.  The existence of a “moral law” (which Collins defines as the universal observance by humans of codes of right and wrong) can be understood only by the existence of a creator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most bizarre of all his arguments, and the one which most strenuously evades both science and reason.  The existence of human morals can be understood as a result of either evolution, evolved rationality, or both.  One common explanation involves the evolution of reciprocal altruism in small communities of hunter-gatherers.  Another, advanced by Peter Singer and others, invokes rationality itself — recognizing that nobody has a moral claim to be special — and the extension of that in interdigitating societies.  There are perfectly good non-God reasons for individuals and societies to adopt and adhere to moral codes.  Collins pretends that these reasons don’t exist.  Indeed, he cites the existence of “extreme altruism,” as demonstrated by Oskar Schindler’s saving Jews at risk to his own life, as evidence that altruism isn’t evolved.  This shows no such thing.  Some people choose to adopt children, a manifestly nonadaptive act, but that doesn’t show that the drive to be parents didn’t evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most inane and disingenuous part of Collins’s argument is his claim that without religion, the concepts of good and evil are meaningless. (Collins’s slide 5 in Harris’s piece: “If the moral law is just a side effect of evolution,  then there is no such thing as good or evil. It’s all an illusion. We’ve been hoodwinked. Are any of us, especially the strong atheists, really prepared to live our lives within that worldview?”)  That’s palpable nonsense.  Good and evil are defined with respect to their effects and the intents of their perpetrators, not by adherence to some religious code.  It is beyond my ken how a smart guy like Collins can make a claim like this, even going so far as to argue that “strong atheists”  like Richard Dawkins have to accept and live their lives within a world in which good and evil are meaningless ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, also statements made without evidence, including this one:  “God gifted humanity with the knowledge of good and evil (the Moral Law), with free will, and with an immortal soul”  And this (slide 4): “We humans used our free will to break the moral law, leading to our estrangement from God.” How does he know? What’s the evidence? Isn’t the distinction between the science slides and the faith slides being blurred here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at it this way:  suppose Collins gave a talk sketching the evidence for evolution, and then went on to say how “evidence” points to the past existence of a space alien ruler named Xenu, who kidnapped some of his people, preserved them in antifreeze, and transported them to Earth, where they were stored in volcanoes. The souls later escaped and are now wandering around, clinging to humans, and this is what causes all the trouble of the world.  Only by detecting this soul-infestation with a fancy instrument, and subsequent deprogramming, Collins might say, can we root out these disembodied vestigial souls and find happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Collins said this, you might well think he’s a wack-job, too ridden with crazy ideas to hold down an important government job.  But of course the beliefs I described constitute &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/28/which-theology-should-we-respect/"&gt;the theology of Scientology&lt;/a&gt;, and are no different in kind from the beliefs of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or of any other faith.  The reason why it’s ok for Collins to profess evangelical Christianity is because Christianity is a superstition that is common and socially sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great irony of this talk is the contrast between Collins’s entirely reasonable dismissal of intelligent design as being based on God-of-the-gaps arguments, and his credulous acceptance of those same arguments when it comes to matters like morality, multiverses, and the so-called fine-tuning of physical constants. At one point he avers that scientists should not invoke supernatural causes if natural causes will do, but then abandons this stand when it comes to physics.  Shouldn’t we give physicists a few decades to figure out why the “constants” are as they are, just as we gave biochemists some time to figure out how the flagellum evolved? Apparently not.  Collins has decided that science will always be impotent before certain problems, whose continued existence must therefore prove God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of evasion and use of double standards is of course &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt; for religious scientists who insist on publicly harmonizing their faith with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Collins continues to go around giving talks like this as head of the NIH, I will no longer give him the benefit of the doubt.  He is polluting science with faith — and hurting public understanding of science — by pretending that empirical evidence points to the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;

Many drugs, food additives, and industrial chemicals are churned out by engineered bacteria in large vats. Bacteria are little protein and chemical factories and we put them to good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But engineering a strain of bacteria to do exactly what we want is laborious and expensive. Traditionally engineers have tweaked one or two genes at a time and then looked for the results. But the production of many substances by bacteria may be controlled by 20 or more genes, and so the permutations of various mutations are enormous – too many to test individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17514-evolution-machine-speeds-up-search-for-better-bugs.html"&gt;genetic engineers have developed a new technique&lt;/a&gt; known as MAGE – multiplex automated genome engineering. What they do is to essentially evolve bacteria with optimized or at least greatly improved production of the substance of interest. The technique causes bacteria to rapidly mutate – causing thousands of mutations and billions of different strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;This technique allows us to do some amount of rapid evolution,” says Harris Wang, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, who led the project along with colleagues Farren Isaacs and George Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then select for the strains that produce the most of whatever they are looking for. Wang and Isaacs use lycopene as an example. Conveniently, lycopene stains bacteria red, so they can just select the reddest strains. For other end products other markers will have to be used. For example, for some protein products genetic engineers have incorporated bits of DNA into the target gene that produce fluorescence, so that the cells that glow the most have the highest concentration of the target protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology has a great deal of promise, as does anything that makes it cheaper and faster for industrial development of new products and methods. In addition to speeding up the production of new drugs, it may help our quest for biofuels. Some scientists think that biofuels may be a solution to our dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuel crops can be homegrown and they are a renewable resource. However, if we use existing farmland and farm crops this will raise the price of food, and corn and other such crops are not efficient sources of biofuel – it is still debatable if they even produce as much energy as they consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is therefore shifting to biomass that has a higher energy density, a higher crop density (more biomass per acre), is currently a crop waste product (like stalks) or grows wild (like &lt;a href="http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/switgrs.html"&gt;switchgrass&lt;/a&gt;). The problem with these sources of biofuel is that we need to develop an industrial process that can convert the tough fibers into ethanol – in a massive and cost effective way. Economics and scale are the keys – if it costs too much to make the biofuel, it won’t happen on a large scale while gasoline is relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are many research programs going on right now, no one has developed a complete and cost effective industrial scale process for extracting biofuel from switchgrass or a similar source. One of the best hopes, however, is bacteria. If we can engineer a bacteria to eat the grass and produce some substance, like ethanol or something close to ethanol, that can then be easily refined into biofuel, we are off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since optimization of yield and efficiency is key to the success of any such process, the MAGE technique may prove essential to the success of biofuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAGE technique is also interesting because it is a direct application of evolutionary principles. The process works by increasing diversity randomly through mutations and then selecting those bacteria that by chance have the desirable trait. This clearly demonstrates that the two step process of evolution – random diversity and selection – works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists have argued that evolution cannot work because random mutation cannot provide specificity and direction, and that selection cannot increase information because it is a negative process – it only removes information. This argument is nothing but a diversion from logic and reality, however. It should be obvious that mutations increase information and selection provides non-random specificity and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to MAGE as an example of evolutionary principles, creationists are likely to argue that the MAGE technique allows for the inclusion of genetic mutations already known to be desirable into the mix – including introducing genes from other species. So the diversity does not have to be entirely random. But even when it is, the process still works. Also, the selection is artifical, not natural. This is an old objection by creationists to artificial selection as an analogy of evolution. This is a non sequitur, however – the analogy is that selection can drive non-random change in a randomly varying system. It doesn’t matter if the selection is artificial or natural, all that matters is differential survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By itself, of course, MAGE does not prove that evolution is true. No single line of evidence can do this. But is does support basic evolutionary principles with a practical application. Creationists often charge that evolution has no practical application, as if utility is a marker of scientific truth.

Many drugs, food additives, and industrial chemicals are churned out by engineered bacteria in large vats. Bacteria are little protein and chemical factories and we put them to good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But engineering a strain of bacteria to do exactly what we want is laborious and expensive. Traditionally engineers have tweaked one or two genes at a time and then looked for the results. But the production of many substances by bacteria may be controlled by 20 or more genes, and so the permutations of various mutations are enormous – to many to test individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17514-evolution-machine-speeds-up-search-for-better-bugs.html"&gt;genetic engineers have developed a new technique&lt;/a&gt; known as MAGE – multiplex automated genome engineering. What they do is to essentially evolve bacteria with optimized or at least greatly improved production of the substance of interest. The technique causes bacteria to rapidly mutate – causing thousands of mutations and billions of different strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This technique allows us to do some amount of rapid evolution,” says Harris Wang, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, who led the project along with colleagues Farren Isaacs and George Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then select for the strains that produce the most of whatever they are looking for. Wang and Isaacs use lycopene as an example. Conveniently, lycopene stains bacteria red, so they can just select the reddest strains. For other end products other markers will have to be used. For example, for some protein products genetic engineers have incorporated bits of DNA into the target gene that produce fluorescence, so that the cells that glow the most have the highest concentration of the target protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology has a great deal of promise, as does anything that makes it cheaper and faster for industrial development of new products and methods. In addition to speeding up the production of new drugs, it may help our quest for biofuels. Some scientists think that biofuels may be a solution to our dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuel crops can be homegrown and they are a renewable resource. However, if we use existing farmland and farm crops this will raise the price of food, and corn and other such crops are not efficient sources of biofuel – it is still debatable if they even produce as much energy as they consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention is therefore shifting to biomass that has a higher energy density, a higher crop density (more biomass per acre), is currently a crop waste product (like stalks) or grows wild (like &lt;a href="http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/switgrs.html"&gt;switchgrass&lt;/a&gt;). The problem with these sources of biofuel is that we need to develop an industrial process that can convert the tough fibers into ethanol – in a massive and cost effective way. Economics and scale are the keys – if it costs too much to make the biofuel, it won’t happen on a large scale while gasoline is relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are many research programs going on right now, no one has developed a complete and cost effective industsrial scale process for extracting biofuel from switchgrass or a similar source. One of the best hopes, however, are bacteria. If we can engineer a bacteria to eat the grass and produce some substance, like ethanol or something close to ethanol, that can then be easily refined into biofuel, we are off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since optimization of yield and efficiency is key to the success of any such process, the MAGE technique may prove essential to the success of biofuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAGE technique is also interesting because it is a direct application of evolutionary principles. The process works by increasing diversity randomly through mutations and then selecting those bacteria that by chance have the desirable trait. This clearly demonstrates that the two step process of evolution – random diversity and selection – works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists have argued that evolution cannot work because random mutation cannot provide specificity and direction, and that selection cannot increase information because it is a negative process – it only removes information. This argument is nothing but a diversion from logic and reality, however. It should be obvious that mutations increase information and selection provides non-random specificity and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to MAGE as an example of evolutionary principles, creationists are likely to argue that the MAGE technique allows for the inclusion of genetic mutations already known to be desirable into the mix – including introducing genes from other species. So the diversity does not have to be entirely random. But even when it is, the process still works. Also, the selection is artifical, not natural. This is an old objection by creationists to artifical selection as an anology of evolution. This is a non sequitur, however – the analogy is that selection can drive non-random change in a randomly varying system. It doesn’t matter if the selection is artificial or natural, all that matters is differential survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By itself, of course, MAGE does not prove that evolution is true. No single line of evidence can do this. But is does support basic evolutionary principles with a practical application. Creationists often charge that evolution has no practical application, as if utility is a marker of scientific truth. Not only is this argument fallacious, it is factually incorrect. Creationists excel at being wrong in two or more ways simultaneously. At least they are good at something.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s because Senator Harkin is undeniably the father of that misbegotten beast that has sucked down over &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/the_ap_shoots_and_scores_again.php"&gt;$2.5 billion of taxpayer money&lt;/a&gt; with nothing to show for it. NCCAM is the brainchild of Senator Harkin, who foisted it upon the National Institutes of Health not because there was a scientific need for it or because scientists and physicians cried out for it but rather because Senator Harkin, who believed that alternative medicine had healed a friend of his, wanted it, and he used his powerful position to make it happen, first as the Office of Unconventional Therapies, then as the Office of Alternative Medicine, and finally as the behemoth of woo that we know today as NCCAM. The result has included a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=554"&gt;$30 million trial of chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; in which convicted felons were listed among the investigators and a totally &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=298"&gt;unethical trial of the Gonzalez therapy&lt;/a&gt; for pancreatic cancer. It’s not for naught that Wally Sampson called for the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;defunding of NCCAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=345"&gt;as have I&lt;/a&gt; and others. Not surprisingly, alternative medicine practitioners are &lt;a href="http://www.helfgottblog.com/2009/03/defund-nccam-dont-throw-the-baby-out-with-the-bathwater/"&gt;appalled at this idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Harkin has been most disturbed by the observation that NCCAM’s trials have all been negative, going so far as to complain that NCCAM hasn’t produced any positive results showing that various alternative therapies actually work. This is, of course, not a surprise, given that vast majority of the grab bag of unrelated (and sometimes theoretically mutually exclusive) therapies are based on pseudoscience. One of the only exceptions is the study of herbal remedies, which is a perfectly respectable branch of pharmacology known as pharmacognosy. Unfortunately, as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=402"&gt;David Kroll showed&lt;/a&gt;, in NCCAM the legitimate science of pharmacognosy has been hijacked for purposes of woo. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Senator Harkin hosted a hearing in which Drs. Dean Ornish, Andrew Weil, Mehment Oz, and Mark Hyman (he of “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=556"&gt;functional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=571"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;“) were invited to testify in front of the Senate. Add to that other powerful legislators, such as Representative Dan Burton (R-IN), trying to craft legislation in line with his anti-vaccine views and pressure the NIH to study various discredited hypotheses about vaccines and autism. Clearly, when it comes to quackery, there are powerful legislative forces promoting pseudoscience and studies driven by ideology rather than science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When politicians play politics with peer review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What brought this to mind (and led to my regurgitation of two paragraphs of history about this) are two very disturbing pieces of news that surfaced on Friday. They come from the opposite sides of the political spectrum. One, as you might imagine, involves Senator Harkin. One involves a Republican. What they share in common is that they serve to illustrate how perilous it is when legislators try to insert their ideology into science and medicine funded by the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go on, I should point out that, in any endeavor funded by the federal government, the insertion of some politics will be inevitable. It can’t be otherwise, and I’m not sure that it should be. Legislators who write the laws funding, for example, the NIH, the National Science Foundation (NSF), Medicare, and other federally-funded research are accountable to their constituents for how taxpayer money is spent. However, poltics and science are all too often a contentious mixture, which is why it is desirable to place as much buffers between direct involvement meddling of legislators in the science as possible. Part of the genius of how the NIH and NSF are set up is that scientists can apply for funding for virtually any project they wish to do, and their proposals will be considered seriously through careful peer review. In other words, it is scientists, not politicians and bureaucrats, who decide what work is and is not funded “in the trenches” on a day-to-day basis. Meanwhile, elected representatives decide the overall broad picture of what is and is not funded through legislation funding various agencies and through Presidential appointment and Congressional confirmation of Directors of various agencies, such as the NIH and NSF, who then hire the leadership of these agencies and decide how they will run and what science they will emphasize. All in all, for a product of the messy democratic process, it works pretty well, and the track record of NIH- and NSF-funded research is the envy of much of the world (well, except for NCCAM, but nobody’s perfect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of that stops legislators from periodically trying to insert themselves into the process by passing laws targeting specific research proposals, and that’s just what happened late last week through the passage of hte so-called Issa Amendment to the FY 2010 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill. Specifically, Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/7/24/125254/452"&gt;offered an amendment&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.researchamerica.org/app/webroot/blog/?tag=issa-amendment"&gt;rescind funding&lt;/a&gt; for three currently funded, peer-reviewed NIH grants that that focus on HIV/AIDS prevention, and the the House of Representatives &lt;a href="http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.html"&gt;passed the amendment by voice vote&lt;/a&gt;, and Issa is &lt;a href="http://issa.house.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=News.PressReleases&amp;amp;ContentRecord_id=ae2d96f3-19b9-b4b1-12c1-9076f7160ca1"&gt;crowing about it on his website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is my mission to hold the federal government accountable for its spending and the NIH is no exception, especially during the current economic crisis” Issa said.  “These studies are clearly not high priorities for U.S. citizens, suffering from disease here at home, who could benefit from the $5 million the NIH plans to spend on foreign alcoholics and prostitutes.  We need to get the NIH’s priorities in line with those of the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the grants that are targeted for de-funding through the Issa Amendment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=7685204&amp;amp;p_grant_num=1R21DA026324-01A1&amp;amp;p_query=&amp;amp;ticket=100317766&amp;amp;p_audit_session_id=481263178&amp;amp;p_keywords="&gt;Substance Abuse Use and HIV Risk Among Thai Women (1R21 DA026324)&lt;/a&gt;: The proposed collaboration study between Ms. Usaneya Perngparn, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand and Dr. Nemoto, Public Health Institute, California, will investigate the sociocultural contexts of HIV risk behaviors and drug use among Thai female and male-to-female transgender (kathoey) sex workers in Bangkok. Research is currently needed to develop and adapt HIV prevention models that take into account sociocultural factors so that the further transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections can be averted. Participation in these types of studies also can provide a way for persons suffering from the health consequences of illicit sexual activity to receive treatment while contributing to our knowledge of prevention and treatment outcomes in these populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://harmreductionpsych.blogspot.com/2009/07/call-congress-today-to-protect-peer.html"&gt;HIV Prevention for Hospitalized Russian Alcoholics (5R01 AA016059)&lt;/a&gt;: nvestigators are adapting a prevention approach that has been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing high-risk HIV related behaviors in the U.S. for use in Russia, a country with a rapidly expanding incidence of HIV.C2 The approach, called Health Relationships Intervention, involves the development of a plan of action for each client to increase social support and reduce high-risk behaviors. This includes the disclosure of information to family and friends on the client’s health, social needs and condition thereby assisting the client in maintaining low risk behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/crisp/CRISP_LIB.getdoc?textkey=7623402&amp;amp;p_grant_num=1R01AA018090-01&amp;amp;p_query=&amp;amp;ticket=100317667&amp;amp;p_audit_session_id=481260795&amp;amp;p_keywords="&gt;Venue-based HIV and Alcohol Use Risk Reduction Among Female Sex Workers in China (1R01 AA018090)&lt;/a&gt;: Research has provided evidence linking alcohol-related, high risk sexual behavior with HIV and other sexually-transmitted infections. Research has also provided rich descriptions of social, cultural, and economic contexts in which people engage in alcohol-related sexual risk behaviors. More specifically, alcohol use characteristics (e.g., binge drinking) have been linked with sexual risk-taking that occurs in a range of high risk environments. The investigators have proposed a 5-year study to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-guided, multiple components, and venue-based HIV and alcohol use risk reduction intervention among commercial sex workers (FSWs) in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an NIH-funded researcher and a taxpayer (of quite a bit of tax), I’m very, very disturbed by this, and you as taxpayers should be too. Remember, these are grants that were submitted to the NIH for peer-review. Remember that the NIH peer-review process is the gold standard. Thousands of grant applications per year are evaluated by the study sections charged with reviewing them. In the last three or four years, thanks to the flat NIH budget, which, thanks to biomedical inflation (which is higher than the base rate of inflation), has led to an actual decrease in the purchasing power of the NIH budget allocated for research gratns, as few as 10% of these new applications have been funded, depending upon the Institute. This is a drastic decline compared to the five year time period (FY 1998 to 2003) during which the NIH budget doubled. In those halcyon times, up to 25% or even somewhat more of new grant applications were funded. What this means is that the three grants that Issa is trying to de-fund were considered the cream of the crop as far as HIV/AIDS prevention. They likely had to be at least in the top 15% of grant applications reviewed. What this means is that Representative Issa is intefering with science based on ideology, not because the grants above represent bad science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, studies like this are easy to ridicule if taken out of context of the broader public health effort. As &lt;a href="http://harmreductionpsych.blogspot.com/2009/07/call-congress-today-to-protect-peer.html"&gt;Dr. Andrew Tartarsky&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that HIV/AIDS is a global epidemic that has already killed more than 25 million men, women, and children and 33 million are currently living with HIV, it is clear that prevention of HIV infection should be a priority area of research funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is easy to ridicule if it is taken out of its public health context. The fact is, scientists need to explore a range of research avenues in vulnerable populations around the world to learn the best ways to control the transmission of HIV. In response to previous congressional concerns about whether sexual health research should be funded by the agency, NIH reviewed the entire NIH sexuality portfolio in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That investigation found that all of the NIH grants in areas of sexual health met the rigorous standards of scientific and ethical quality, that they were not funded out of proportion to the public health burden of these diseases, and that the merit review system had been followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts by politicians like Rep. Issa to meddle in the peer review process and second guess NIH peer-reviewers represent a threat to science-based medicine every bit as profound as that of Sen. Harkin’s championing of pseudoscience. If Rep. Issa can force his ideology on the NIH (and let’s face it, this is almost certainly about conservative religious views more than anything else), then what’s to stop any other Representative (of which there are 435) or Senator (of which there are 100) from doing the same thing? Nothing. It’s also profoundly demoralizing to scientists, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/how_would_you_like_some_postur.php"&gt;Drugmonkey&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great isn’t it? There you are, fighting to get your project funded, surmounting the usual procedural hurdles in the grant process. Finally, you get the grant funded and can get down to the business for which you are employed- doing good science in the interests of national, nay worldwide, public health. And some politician wants to prevent further funding of your project in the middle of the award period for naked political posturing purposes. Grand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grand indeed. There is a long history of various legislators trying to make political hay out of NIH- and NSF-funded grants that are easy to ridicule if you don’t know the science or the broader context of the research. It frequently involves studies of sexuality, too. For example, back in 2003, then Representative Pat Toomey (R-PA, who was also said to be &lt;a href="http://kdka.com/politics/Pat.Toomey.Specter.2.966922.html"&gt;planning to challenge Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt; for his Pennsylvania Senate seat) tried to shut down NIH grants R01 HD043689 R03 HD039206, R01 DA013896, and R01 MH065871, all of which were focused on sexuality. (Surprise.) Fortunately, his efforts were shot down (narrowly, alas) and &lt;a href="http://www.apa.org/science/psa/may4ppo.html"&gt;resulted in the formation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.cossa.org/CPR/cpr.html"&gt;Coalition to Protect Research&lt;/a&gt;, part of whose mission is to educate legislators on the importance of the peer review process. We can only hope that the horrible Issa Amendment is &lt;a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2009/07/conservative-at.html"&gt;removed from the final bill&lt;/a&gt; passed after a House-Senate Conference Committee. You can help by contacting your Congressional Representatives to urge them to remove the Issa Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s not forget the late Senator William Proxmire’s (D-WI) Golden Fleece Award. Although the award often served to highlight truly wasteful government spending, all too often as collateral damage it targeted in a breathtakingly ignorant fashion scientific studies funded by various government agencies because they sounded funny to non-scientists. One researcher, after having received such an honor, went through a rather nasty &lt;a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2001"&gt; ordeal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This silliness went on for many years. The news stories began to swirl around like some kind of toxic cosmic dust. Senator Proxmire would return to Madison on a Sunday (to attend a Badgers’ football game); he’d take that opportunity to appear on a local TV show denouncing (sigh!) love research. I would be asked to reply. On Monday, one of Senator Proxmire’s comic writers would issue a devastatingly funny press release (inaccurate but beguiling) about the inanities of our love and sex research. By Tuesday morning, I’d be reeling from its aftershock. On Wednesday, the fallout would be settling in near Tokyo. Stories would appear in the &lt;strong&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mainichi Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Yomiuri Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;. A few weeks later, &lt;em&gt;The Bangladeshi Standard&lt;/em&gt;’s Geiger counters would be clicking out the news. Each time an editor in Japan, Bangladesh, or Mozambique translated the story, a name would get misspelled here, a word altered there, and the next thing you know, the &lt;em&gt;Wisconsin State Journal&lt;/em&gt; would have picked up the challenge or comic riff yet again. The news story would be so altered and so sensationalized—by now, Dr. Hatfield, the mad doctor of love, would be caught slipping women dime bags of marijuana, asking students to confess their darkest secrets while both were doing God-knows-what in their bedrooms— that the Journal would assume that somehow they’d missed a heck of a story. Then once more the dust would start swirling around the earth, entering newer and higher orbits with each new news cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know the postman very well indeed as he dragged in mail by the bagful…Crazy persons’ letters, with blood curdling threats. Spiky letters, painstakingly, tremblingly constructed. Letters written in Day-Glo colors. Words marching in an orderly way across the top of the page, down the sides, and along the bottom, but then they began to sprawl in upon themselves, growing smaller and smaller as they whirled around the page. At the vortex, the microscopic calligraphy ended in a sinister inkblot. Letters filled with pain and suffering. Most people, of course, wanted to know how they could scam some of the US government’s “loot” for themselves. When they discovered they would have to dash off a grant—and actually get that grant reviewed—they were irate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the Internet had been as easily available in the 1970s as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I well remember in my youth hearing stories from Senator Proxmire of government-funded studies looking at bear sperm or some other equally ridiculous-sounding research (or so it seemed to me at the time). I’d chuckle and wonder just what those scientists were smoking. Now that I am a scientist, I realize just how toxic Senator Proxmire was when he targeted scientific studies. Fortunately, however, as far as I know Senator Proxmire never tried to insert himself directly into the NIH and NSF peer-review process by directly trying to stop one of these studies. These days, legislators are not content with just making political hay by issuing press releases and awards. They want to stop ongoing research projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When politicians impose their ideology on science-based policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Senator Harkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already gone on a bit of a rant about how Sen. Harkin wants to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=369"&gt;hijack President Obama’s health care reform initiative&lt;/a&gt; in order to let alternative medicine into the range of “services” funded by any new government health plan by hiding it in the Trojan horse of “prevention” and “healthy living” initiatives. Of course, Harkin and his fellow travelers co-opt diet and exercise, both of which are science-based interventions, as somehow being “alternative” and then use them as the “foot in the door” to introduce all sorts of other “alternative” medical modalities that represent themselves as being “prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it appears, that Sen. Harkin has made his desire explicit, as described in an &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/07/24/senators_seek_coverage_for_alternative_therapies/"&gt;article that appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Friday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturopathic doctors, herbal healers, mind-body specialists, and acupuncturists often have been scorned by the US medical establishment, but growing numbers of Americans are seeking such care, and now an influential group of US senators believes the time has come to embrace an array of alternative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who is a longtime supporter of nontraditional medicine, is at the forefront of the effort to win insurance coverage for such providers as part of national healthcare legislation.&lt;br&gt;
“It’s time to end the discrimination against alternative healthcare practices,’’ Harkin said at a congressional hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin is the cosponsor of an amendment that says healthcare plans will not be allowed to “discriminate’’ against any healthcare provider who has a license issued by a state, an amendment Senate aides said was designed to provide coverage for alternative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the language that Sen. Harkin has slipped into the 615 page &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/BAI09A84_xml.pdf"&gt;Senate version of the health care reform bill&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.—The term “health professionals” includes—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A) dentists, dental hygienists, primary 25 care providers, specialty physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, psychologists and other behavioral and mental health professionals, social workers, physical therapists, public health professionals, clinical pharmacists, allied health professionals, chiropractors, community health workers, school nurses, certified nurse midwives, podiatrists, licensed complementary and alternative medicine providers, and integrative health practitioners;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a tiny passage in a huge bill, yet it has potentially enormous consequences. If this part of the bill remains unchanged in whatever legislation makes it through Congress later this year then any “alternative health care provider” licensed by any state in the union will be entitled to compensation for his services from the government and health insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Let’s consider some examples. Acupuncturists are licensed in 44 states; so in those states acupuncturists will be able to bill the government and insurance companies for their services. Naturopaths are licensed in 15 states; so in those states naturopaths will be able to bill for their services. Combine this with recent push by naturopaths to be considered “primary care physicians,” and you can see the potential disaster looming. Remember, naturopathy is the cornucopia of woo. Many of them include in their practice supplements, acupuncture, reiki, and even &lt;a href="http://www.hanp.net/"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered to be within the &lt;a href="http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy"&gt;normal scope of naturopathic practice&lt;/a&gt;. To them it’s all good as long as it’s “alternative.” Now that I mention homeopathy, let’s not forget that some states actually license “homeopathic physicians,” states such as &lt;a href="http://www.azhomeopathbd.az.gov/"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ct-clic.com/Agency/appView.asp?AppView=Physician+Licensure+-+Homeopathy+-Initial___Authorize+an+individual+to+practice+homeopathic+medicine.___1710___789&amp;amp;appID=1710"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.nvbhme.com/"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. If Harkin has his way, these homeopathic physicians will be able to bill the government and insurance plans for treating their patients with water. Of course, if this bill passes with Harkin’s amendment intact, you can then expect agitation by naturopaths and homeopaths in other states in which they are not licensed to set up licensure, so that they can equal their fellow woo practitioners fortunate enough to live in Arizona, Connecticut, or Nevada or the 14 states that license naturopaths. It would only be fair, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Politics as a threat to science-based medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, scientists and physicians wouldn’t have to worry about the intrusion of non-science-based ideology into the conduct of scientific research or science-based medicine. However, we do not live in an ideal world. Someone has to fund science, and in the U.S. one major funder of biomedical and other basic research is the federal government. Charities and philanthropic organizations also fund research, but their funding is nearly always targeted far more narrowly at the causes that are the &lt;em&gt;raison d’être&lt;/em&gt; of individual organizations. Pharmaceutical companies also fund considerable research, but their priorities are profit-driven. In other words, if a given research project doesn’t have the potential to result in a marketable drug or product, pharmaceutical companies are highly unlikely to fund it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to the federal government, where &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/07/24/senators_seek_coverage_for_alternative_therapies/"&gt;support for woo is bipartisan:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two main sponsors of the Senate amendment were Harkin and Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat. Republicans, including the ranking member on the Senate health committee, Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, also backed the amendment. The Senate committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions agreed to the measure, but it will be left to the Senate Finance Committee, which is working on companion legislation, to write crucial language regarding potential reimbursement, Senate aides said. The matter will then be debated on the Senate floor, and a similar amendment is expected to be offered in the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the problem goes far beyond just biomedical science. Any endeavor of the federal government which contains a large component based on science is fair game, be it climate policy, the environment, the space program, or others. Worse, as is the case with these others, the forces arrayed against science-based medicine tend to be well-funded, more savvy politically, and certainly more motivated than scientists are. Sen. Harkin, for example, knows that few other legislators will understand the significance of the few lines he slipped into the healthcare reform bill and few of their constituents will understand or care. The same is true of Rep. Issa regarding his naked attempt to invalidate NIH peer review. Both also know that their fellow legislators are highly unlikely to hold up such huge bills and that the President is highly unlikely to veto them  over such tiny amendments. Indeed, Sen. Harkin knows that health care reform is President Obama’s signature issue and that Obama desperately wants to pass a major health care reform bill before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as distasteful as it is, if we as physicians and scientists, along with citizens who support science-based medicine, want to stop these sorts of attempts to impose ideology-based, rather than science-based, medicine upon health care reform, we’re going to get involved in the political process. We’re going to have to contact our Senators and Representatives and tell them that we don’t want them interfering in peer review of individual competitive scientific grants and that we don’t want our taxpayer dollars going to pay for quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our original concept had been to simply collect donations in association with TAM registration, and to present the SNHD with those proceeds at TAM 7.  The relatively late conception of the project combined with working to ensure that donated funds would be used to their optimal effect meant that it was an understated affair with relatively little publicity.  When combined with the current economy and the fact that attending TAM has never been a cheap affair, we had no idea what kind of response the project would receive.&lt;/p&gt;

Our staff and membership are composed of both believers and non-believers, and the question of whether there's a "god" is not addressed by the JREF directly. However, the following affects us all, and demonstrates a clear lack of critical thinking on behalf of the management at the American diner chain known as "Denny's."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself in Euless, TX this morning, and decided to have breakfast at Denny's with my Macbook Pro. As I approached, I saw the attached flyer affixed to the door (&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/dennysflyer.jpg"&gt;click for larger image&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit taken aback, as I knew there had been &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1998/april98/frontpage.html"&gt;controversies about this practice in the past&lt;/a&gt;, and I had naively thought such promotions were a matter of history. But this was even worse... not only were folks who attended church given a 10% discount, their church received a donation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I considered leaving right then, but decided to have my meal as planned and then discuss the matter with the manager on the way out. At no time was I concerned about the discount for myself: 10% off a $10 meal isn't much of a motivator. This was a matter of principle, so I decided to confront the manager directly. Though this isn't something I'm terribly comfortable with, it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248689129334"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1605">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2b37f210bea4cf9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Animal communication"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Car Talk translated</title><published>2009-07-27T09:43:29Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T09:43:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1605" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalk1a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="747310"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalkMech1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="92368"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalkMech2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="60185"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalkMech3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="56005"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalkMech4.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="91114"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalkMech5.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="57677"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CarTalkMech6.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="110758"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The "show open topic" for &lt;a href="http://www.cartalk.com/ct/review/rundown.jsp?showid=200930"&gt;this week's Car Talk&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="http://www.cartalk.com/index.html"&gt;the show's web page&lt;/a&gt;, is "Tom and Ray translate the grunts of mechanics".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Alexandra Sellers' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spoken-Cat-Alexandra-Sellers/dp/1857251172/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoken Cat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was published a dozen years ago, and similarly, the Newsweek article about it (Lucy Howard and Carla Koehl, "&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/107027"&gt;Talk The Talk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;), ran on May 5, 1997. But Tom and Ray are not broadcasting from a parallel space-time continuum. Rather, this is an &amp;quot;encore edition&amp;quot;, which apparently means that the jokes — and the automobile repair advice? — are 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Luckily, animal communication, like car repair, is an evergreen. And so is Tom and Ray's glossary of car mechanic's noises. (Since they're grease monkeys themselves, they're entitled to make what might seem, if it came from another NPR personality, like a snooty elitist joke about the subhuman nature of the lower orders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can listen to the whole thing in context from the show's web page linked above (at least for the next week), or download it as an mp3 file &lt;a href="http://public.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/510208/107009839/npr_107009839.mp3?dl=1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (I think that should be a somewhat durable link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can hear, the performance is, shall we say, subtly variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the official translation? "Hi, how are you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the next one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray (or is it Tom, I&amp;#39;ve lost track at this point) guesses &amp;quot;I think I know what&amp;#39;s wrong with this car&amp;quot;, but that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;going too deep&amp;quot; — it turns out to mean &amp;quot;Fine, thanks&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next guess is wrong too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then they get in sync:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And stay that way for a while:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though another communicative failure comes up at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Ray get more laughs out of this than most students of non-verbal communication do; but they've hit on the serious essence of the problem: such signals  generate a sense of recognition (if not always a belly-laugh) when prcessed in context, but they're very hard to understand in the abstract, because of their almost complete lack of referential anchoring.&lt;/p&gt;

In thinking about what my son might be doing and even where he might be living, I've been reading some about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/down_on_the_farm"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_farms_intentional_communities"&gt;intentional communities&lt;/a&gt;. One concern that's come up about such living situations, and about "intentional communities" in particular, is whether or not they're really segregated institution-like places, where individuals with disabilities live apart from the greater community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The July 5th &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/magazine/05food-t-000.html?ref=magazine"&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/a&gt; looks at farms in the city that are quite beyond the proverbial plot of vegetables. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/magazine/05allen-t.html?ref=magazine"&gt;Street Farmer&lt;/a&gt; profiles Will Allen and his &lt;a href="http://www.growingpower.org"&gt;Growing Power&lt;/a&gt; farm in Milwaukee which has"14 greenhouses crammed onto two acres in a working-class neighborhood on Milwaukee’s northwest side, less than half a mile from the city’s largest public-housing project. A second article, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/magazine/05food-t-000.html?ref=magazine"&gt;Home Sweet (Urban) Homestead&lt;/a&gt;, looks at farming that's going on in "a gritty block in Oakland, Calif. — the kind of neighborhood that quickens your step even on a bright Sunday afternoon," in the "urban homestead" of Anya Fernald: "In Oakland, where backyard menageries and D.I.Y. charcuterie are the new garage band, the term 'urban homesteading' doesn’t need an explanation. 'It fits into the Oakland sort of self-defined vibe or aesthetic of doing things from scratch and being kind of hard-core,'" as Fernald is quoted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both articles are specifically about the numerous benefits---for health, jobs, self-sufficiency, more---of such urban farms. Reading about Fernald's "homestead" in Oakland, I'm reminded very much of the "urban farm" my grandmother, Ngin-ngin, kept going on the porch of her second-story duplex on Madison Avenue and in the yard below. When my father was growing up, they grew vegetables and kept chickens (all of whom wandered away one day when someone left the gate open; I've never been able to get the image of a line of chickens wandering the streets of Oakland by the Oakland Museum and the Alameda County Courthouse out of my head). Ngin-Ngin made everything, from endless types and amounts of food (I was going to write "Chinese food," but that seems somewhat repetitive in this case) to moonshine to clothes, blankets, you name it. (There's also a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt; angle, but I won't get into that now; it is the fifth of July.) If she didn't get vegetables from the yard ("urban homestead"), they came from Chinatown's markets and, of course, from Tai Wah, which Yeh Yeh, my grandfather, owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suburban New Jersey---I mean, this is the Garden State---offers a few more places to plant some seeds and let a garden grow. As I've learned from making brownies with Charlie, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_process_is_the_thing"&gt;the process is the thing&lt;/a&gt;, and why not show him where food (well, some types of food) come from? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie is definitely curious about food preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In baking, he's interested in dumping the ingredients into a bowl and mixing (and sneaking tastes). The final ingredient draws his interest when it comes out of the oven but he's less inclined to eat the results of our handiwork afterwards. I'm hardly ready to hand Charlie a knife to mince parsley with, but he can certainly learn to measure out ingredients and stir; the last time we made brownies, we worked on breaking eggs. (Previously, Charlie took the eggs from the fridge and placed them atop the other ingredients.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've been doing a lot more cooking this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too revolutionary or in-the-interest-of-autism-advocacy about that and the reason is simply that---as I'm not teaching summer school for the first time in awhile and I've many fewer administrative duties---I've had more time. Time to chop green onions and ginger and parsley. Time to cook chicken "velvet" style and make lemon sauce and to put together the batter for pancakes and have Charlie help mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Charlie, we like to show rather than tell. Jim taught him to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/we_ride_bikes_together"&gt;ride a bike&lt;/a&gt; with minimal verbal explanations. We held Charlie's feet on the pedals of his tricycle and then his little training-wheel'd bike and showed him how to rotate his legs. Jim started teaching Charlie to use the hand brakes by, simply, putting his hands over Charlie and saying "squeeze brakes." When they were actually riding bikes in the street and came to a stop sign, held Charlie's shoulder while repeating "squeeze brakes," only gradually fading out the shoulder hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still use photographs in Charlie's activity and other schedules, but there's nothing like actually (versus in something like a video) showing him how to do something. And cooking being the multi-sensory experience that it is---involving taste of course and smell and touch---drawing on all those other senses is a good way for Charlie to learn some things, some life's lessons that start in the kitchen and that will, we hope, radiate out beyond the yard and our suburban homestead and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248676362215"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/07/blogging_queue_overflow_abort.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/604cadef4495f90a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this Blag"/><title type="html">Blogging Queue Overflow:  Abort, Retry, Fail?</title><published>2009-07-27T06:04:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-27T06:04:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~3/vAqcNhu0sn8/blogging_queue_overflow_abort.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/07/blogging_queue_overflow_abort.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book reviewing is a subject often in the air, here in the Scientifickal Blogohedron, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2008/08/an_alloy_of_pleasures.php"&gt;I've done my share of that&lt;/a&gt;.  I've been falling behind, though:  I have a whole stack of books I've bought or been given, all of which deserve careful consideration.  My SciBling &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/"&gt;Jason Rosenhouse&lt;/a&gt; arranged to have me receive &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monty-Hall-Problem-Remarkable-Contentious/dp/0195367898/"&gt;The Monty Hall Problem&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; his exposition of the classic brain-warping conundrum, and I'm glad to say I liked it.  A few of the chapters are "college" instead of "pop"; it'd make a good follow-up for those who read and enjoyed Leonard Mlodinow's &lt;i&gt;The Drunkard's Walk,&lt;/i&gt; which I was also sent.  Mlodinow's book is a pleasant mix of the historical development of probability theory with its present-day applications.  Good on concepts and motivations, it doesn't go as far into the mechanics of how one calculates with statistics as, for example, the &lt;a href="http://www.larrygonick.com/html/pub/books/sci7.html"&gt;Cartoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/book_review_the_manga_guide_to.php"&gt;Manga guides&lt;/a&gt; on that subject do.  It's more in the vein of Huff's &lt;i&gt;How to Lie with Statistics&lt;/i&gt; or Paulos's &lt;i&gt;Innumeracy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the fiction side, there've been Blackford's &lt;i&gt;Kong Reborn&lt;/i&gt; and Egan's &lt;i&gt;Incandescence&lt;/i&gt; and. . . oh, well, you get the idea.  I am, and always have been, a bookworm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to this the heap of draft blog posts on other topics currently languishing within ScienceBlogs.com's glitchy Movable Type database, and I have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, my energies have shifted from "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2008/11/how_i_feel_at_least_once_a_day.php"&gt;Someone Is Wrong On The Internet&lt;/a&gt;" mode to "Someone Is Wrong In &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; Magazine".  A couple happy strokes of luck have made my side research projects progress much more fruitfully than I had anticipated.  While this is probably good for my career, it's definitely bad for blogging.  I haven't been around too much in these past few weeks, and my presence here is about to become more scarce still.  Expect me to be quiet until mid-August or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue: Collins is a brilliant scientist/geneticist recently appointed to head the National Institutes of Health.  Collins is also an evangelical Christian.  Should we be concerned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris answers that last question with a definitive “Yes”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What follows are a series of slides, presented in order, from a lecture on science and belief that Dr. Collins gave at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1: “Almighty God, who is not limited in space or time, created a universe 13.7 billion years ago with its parameters precisely tuned to allow the development of complexity over long periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2: “God’s plan included the mechanism of evolution to create the marvelous diversity of living things on our planet. Most especially, that creative plan included human beings.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris goes on for a few more slides…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we get to the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is an epidemic of scientific ignorance in the United States. This isn’t surprising, as very few scientific truths are self-evident, and many are counterintuitive. It is by no means obvious that empty space has structure or that we share a common ancestor with both the housefly and the banana. It can be difficult to think like a scientist. But &lt;strong&gt;few things make thinking like a scientist more difficult than religion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who believes that our understanding of human nature can be derived from neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science and behavioral economics, among others, I am troubled by Dr. Collins’s line of thinking. I also believe it would seriously undercut fields like neuroscience and our growing understanding of the human mind. If we must look to religion to explain our moral sense, what should we make of the deficits of moral reasoning associated with conditions like frontal lobe syndrome and psychopathy? Are these disorders best addressed by theology?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris isn’t suggesting Collins not accept the NIH position or that he never should have been appointed in the first place.  He’s simply pointing out that Collins’ beliefs are troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s right; they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became an atheist over a decade ago, but it has taken me a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to come to grips with the fact that science and religion are simply not compatible.  I wanted to believe they could be — I really did — but I’m now convinced that’s not possible.  Either you accept what science reveals to us wholeheartedly or you don’t (because you think God can intervene and perform “miracles” that contradict science and whatnot).  You can’t have it both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, I still think Collins is a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/09/francis-collins-named-head-of-national-institute-of-health/"&gt;good choice&lt;/a&gt; for the head of the NIH because I have faith he will not use his position to evangelize and he will do what is best for science to progress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, I also think &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; make a strong point when they write that atheists who say that science and religion are incompatible hurt the cause for science.  But it’s not because the atheists are wrong.  Instead, it’s because it’s just too hard a pill for most people to swallow.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious people need to come to atheism on their own, in small steps.  It’s not nearly as effective to have an atheist with a megaphone pointing out that science teaches us that just about everything you know about your god is wrong.  That rubs them the wrong way, even though the atheists are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins isn’t helping atheists make that case.  Nor should he be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that while in the NIH position, Christians can learn to accept certain scientific truths (like evolution occurring over millions of years) and we see fewer battles over science in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, atheists need to continue raising questions, speaking out, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/16/the-debate-over-unscientific-america/"&gt;pointing out contradictions&lt;/a&gt; inherent if you accept both science and religion, and reminding others that Collins’ beliefs (in both science and religion) cannot logically be compatible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of small steps are needed, but we need to start somewhere.  Collins’ position may be one way to push the dialogue in our direction.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the general sentiment over at the Daily Dish during a week-long blog event about atheism.  You can catch the final installment &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/07/until-next-time.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which has links to the rest of the posts.  It’s truly awful, and if I’m so inclined I’ll do several posts about it.  Today though, I want to focus the sentiment that atheists are somehow being rude by talking about their beliefs.  Patrick Appel starts the whole thing off with this complaint about Daniel Dennet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Dennett is &lt;a style="outline-width:0;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;color:#006699;text-decoration:none;border:0 initial initial;margin:0;padding:0" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/jul/16/daniel-dennett-belief-atheism"&gt;disturbed&lt;/a&gt; by tolerance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Today one of the most insistent forces arrayed in opposition to us vocal atheists is the “I’m an atheist &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;” crowd, who publicly deplore our “hostility”, our “rudeness” (which is actually just candour), while privately admitting that we’re right. They don’t themselves believe in God, but they certainly do believe in belief in God…I am confident that those who believe in belief are wrong. That is, we no more need to preserve the myth of God in order to preserve a just and stable society than we needed to cling to the &lt;a style="outline-width:0;outline-style:initial;outline-color:initial;color:#006699;text-decoration:none;border:0 initial initial;margin:0;padding:0" title="Gold Standard" href="http://economics.about.com/cs/money/a/gold_standard.htm"&gt;Gold Standard&lt;/a&gt; to keep our currency sound. It was a useful crutch, but we’ve outgrown it. Denmark, according to a recent study, is the sanest, healthiest, happiest, most crime-free nation in the world, and by and large the Danes simply ignore the God issue. We should certainly hope that those who believe in belief are wrong, because belief is waning fast, and the props are beginning to buckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consider myself an agnostic or pantheist depending upon how you define such labels but still have an acute nostalgia for my Catholic upbringing. I find the certainty of some atheists and most fundamentalists deeply grating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He later clarifies the problems he has with Dennet’s paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not arguing that atheism and fundamentalism are the same. I wrote that the certainty of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; atheists and &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; fundamentalists irks me. What bothered me about Dennett’s article was his policing the acceptable atheist discourse, shoving non-belief in a personal God onto a narrow ideological foothold and saying that atheists must not allow others their illusions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are two things that Mr. Appel finds bothersome, Daniel Dennet’s “certainty” and his unwillingness to “allow others their illusions.”  It seems to me, that what Mr. Appel is actually intolerant of is argumentation.  You see, Dr. Dennet believes that there probably is no god, and he thinks he has some pretty good reasons for believing that (I happen to agree).  He wants to persuade others that there is no god, so he &lt;em&gt;talks about it&lt;/em&gt;.  He tells people why he doesn’t believe in god, and why he thinks they should give up their beliefs.  Above, he is addressing the argument that we might need belief in god to be good, at least on a societal level.  He doesn’t think we do, and as evidence he cites a largely atheist/agnostic country that’s doing pretty well.  What about that doesn’t “&lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; other’s their illusions.”  Nothing, it’s an argument that we don’t need the illusions, and since they’re probably wrong people should probably give them up.  The problem Mr. Appel actually has with this argument is that it is made at all, or made without Dennet prefacing it with “oh but I could be wrong and please shut your ears if you don’t like what I’m saying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Mr. Appel’s readers told him as much in e-mail, to which Mr. Appel responds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve absolutely no problem with Dennett stating his opinions or arguing forcefully for what he believes. But telling fellow non-believers they ought to be less courteous to the faithful strikes me as intolerant of other forms of atheism . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, who can tell me where it is that Dr. Dennet tells fellow non-believers to be less courteous to the faithful? Come on, one of you should be able to point it out.  &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/jul/16/daniel-dennett-belief-atheism"&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; a link to the original article Dr. Dennet wrote, maybe we can find it in there?  No?   Perhaps Mr. Appel is seeing something that isn’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who here thinks that, given an argument on a political issue constructed in a similar manner, Mr. Appel would immediately think “that guy’s certainty and unwillingness to allow others their illusions is so irksome!”  No, he would think that that’s a politician who wants social change of some sort and is arguing for it.  No, it’s only when the social change wanted dares to question other people’s religious beliefs that the argument becomes rude and intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love Mr. Appel to give an example of an atheist who tries to persuade others of his beliefs who he doesn’t find irksome.  My guess though is that Mr. Appel never has seen such a person because to Mr. Appel trying to persuade others about religion is rude by definition.  So let me ask you this, is it more tolerant to live-and-let-live and get upset when others don’t do the same, or to argue for one’s own beliefs and happily engage others who don’t share them?&lt;/p&gt;

This time it’s a document called the &lt;em&gt;Application, Declaration and General Release Declaration of Religious Commitment and Application for Membership in a Scientology Religious Order and for Active Participation on Church Staff. &lt;/em&gt;And this is what they make their new staffers sign before taking the job. Here are some of the strange items all applicants must agree to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. I am not related to or connected with any intelligence agency, either by past history or immediate familial connection.&lt;br&gt;
9. I do NOT have a parent or a guardian who is an antagonist of the Scientology religion, or of any organization devoted to Scientology applied religious philosophy.&lt;br&gt;
10. I am not seeking a staff position to obtain material for dissemination to the public via press, radio, television, motion picture or other media. I do not seek to obtain data for any other organization or to disrupt the Church organization.&lt;br&gt;
11. I do not have personal debts of a magnitude such that efforts to satisfy them would immediately disrupt or cause me to pull back from my commitment to the Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then applicants are to sign an acknowledgment that the “Church” holds the right to not adhere state or federal labor practices because after all, this is a religion and is far too sacred for its employees to expect any material payment at all. And just to make sure you know this is serious, they put this stipulation in all caps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT ALL CHURCH STAFF MEMBERS INCLUDING MYSELF, ARE MEMBERS OF A RELIGIOUS ORDER; THAT THEY SERVE PURSUANT TO THEIR RELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONS AND NOT IN CONTEMPLATION OF RECEIVING ANY COMPENSATION WHATSOEVER, AND IN DOING SO THAT THEY ARE FORSAKING ALL COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL MOTIVATION. PLEASE INITIAL __EACH CONSIDERS HIMSELF/HERSELF A VOLUNTEER TO CREATE A BETTER WORLD, AND UNDERSTANDS THAT HE/SHE IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE, I.E. IS NOT ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SECULAR BENEFITS SUCH AS A MINIMUM WAGE OR OVERTIME COMPENSATION. PLEASE INITIAL __&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the consequences of violating these contractual obligations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. BREACH OF COVENANT. If a staff member . . . breaks his agreement either by leaving staff before completing his commitment [either 2 1/2 or 5 years] or by violating his good standing as a Scientology staff member so that he is dismissed in accordance with policy, he or she shall remit forthwith to the Church a penance for violation of this covenant in accordance with the ecclesiastical policy of the Church if such person is declared a “freeloader”. [...]9. ENTIRETY OF COVENANT. The Church shall not be obligated to honor any verbal promises or any other terms or conditions not specifically covered in this Covenant. This Covenant forms the entirety of the Church’s agreement with the Church staff member, and promises no specific counselling, training, posts or other benefits to any Church staff member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems kinda like a one-way deal. As a $cientologist once say: “I am altering the deal. Pray that I do not alter it any further.” Oh, wait. That wasn’t a $cientologist. It was Darth Vader. I’m always mixing them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least you can sue if they “alter the deal” too much to your dissatisfaction, right? Wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;B. I HEREBY RELEASE AND DISCHARGE THE RELEASES from all actions, claims or demands I, my heirs, distributees, guardians, legal representatives or assigns ever had, now have or may hereafter have for injury or damage resulting from or any way connected with my membership in the Scientology Religious Order, active participation on Church staff or association with the Releasees. [...]I AM AWARE THAT THIS IS A RELEASE OF LIABILITY, COVENANT NOT TO SUE AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE CHURCH AND/OR ITS AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS AND/OR OTHER INDIVIDUALS, AND I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY PLACING MY SIGNATURE AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT I SHALL BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. PLEASE INITIAL __&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! With exploitation like this, is it any wonder that &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1202077/Is-John-Travolta-cracking-Its-just-grief--guilt--dead-son-tearing-actors-apart.html"&gt;the tabloids are gossiping about John Travolta on the verge of leaving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Or by some accounts it's the Swedes who use "Cronkiters." This too-good-to-check linguafactoid came up in the comments on my post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1585"&gt;Walter Leland Mr. Cronkite&lt;/a&gt;," and commenter Lugubert swiftly dismissed the Swedish claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google "cronkiter" and you'll find all hits are in English. Smells of myth. I, Swede, 66, multilingual professional translator, have never seen or heard that word in any language. I'm afraid (read: convinced) that Mr. C is totally unknown by an overwhelming majority of Swedes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, never the less, a similar word would have been adopted into Swedish by the cognoscenti, I'm at least fairly sure that the for Swedish very odd -er would immediately have been replaced by a more normal nomen agentis ending like -erare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no reason to believe the Dutch part of the story, either.

There we hoped to get Alex over his mushrooming loneliness of having his one sibling gone by buying him another big metal letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:260px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/lettere.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/lettere.jpg" alt="Image: cdn.overstock.com" width="250" height="250"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: cdn.overstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and brightest of these things cost $15 each and come in bright colors and stand about nine inches tall, and, if anyone’s interested, make a godawful clatter when dropped on the table in the coffee shop. Alex has the A, the B, the C, and the D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his peerless sense of direction he hopped and tugged us toward Urban Outfitters three blocks away, with every bounce of his feet leaving more and more of any sadness over Ned’s departure further behind. “Letters?” he said. “Letters?” “You can get &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;, Alex,” we said, knowing he’d want to complete the alphabet (which would have been $325.38, plus tax). “You can get one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the store he grabbed the E, which makes sense considering where he’d left off. Then he also tried to grab the F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can get one, Alex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Want two,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held up one finger. “We can get two if we get the cheaper tin version of one of the letters,” said Jill. “No,” I answered, “we’ve got him understanding he’s just going to get one.” She agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex and I returned to the letters as I began to melt on the cheap one/expensive one idea, and I tried to show him the cheap E and the expensive F. Alex, who lately has uttered the name of a new animal for his collection of detailed plastic figures every single time we’ve stepped out our front door, carefully placed the cheap E back and reached for both the expensive E and the expensive F. “Want two,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I held up one finger. He took the E, and later dropped it on the table of the coffeeshop with a godawful clatter. Next time he will want the F I have no doubt, so it’d be a great and interesting sign in his development if instead he opted for an N and another D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw Star Trek.  I saw The Watchmen.  And IMO, Moon is the movie to see this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can’t review it without spoilers, so only click here if you don’t mind spoilers… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the best science fiction engages us in examining and questioning our own humanity, as Moon does.  Moon raises a lot of interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon is set in the future.  A future in which humans have mined the moon for energy source helium 3 that has resolved our current energy crisis.  At the beginning of the film, we’re introduced to Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), a tech with a three year contract to process helium 3, and return it to earth.  Alone.  His only companion is Gerty (voice of Kevin Spacey), a robot there to assist him and ensure his safety.  The film begins at the end of Sam’s three-year stint, and we’re introduced to his wife &amp;amp; daughter by the video messages that he uses to communicate with them.  The family can’t wait to be reunited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Sam begins to hallucinate, causing him to fall victim to an accident in his rover.  After the accident, he presumably awakens in the infirmary with memory damage.  But we soon learn that this isn’t the same Sam.  Despite Gerty’s efforts to keep this Sam inside the base, he gets out and discovers the crashed rover with the first Sam still inside.  This is where it gets interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Sams recognize each other and realize that at least one of them is a clone.  Ironically, they don’t get along very well at first, which raises the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you met yourself, would you like you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Sam confronts Gerty, who confirms that he too is only a clone of the original Sam, and that the video messages from his “family” are merely recordings intended for the original Sam.  Lunar Industries has been cloning the original Sam Bell to work in three-year intervals, at which time the old Sam expires and a new one is awakened.  I was &lt;em&gt;heartbroken&lt;/em&gt; for the Sam clones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you found out your whole life – your parents, your spouse, your child – weren’t real, but actually belonged to someone else? If you could go back to earth, would you be totally lost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll stop there with the spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways Moon is similar to The Matrix, in which humans were unknowingly living in pods, bred as batteries for the AI that had programmed the matrix to make them believe they were living normal lives.  In Moon the clones were being bred to do work, this time for an energy company, and were being misled about their pasts, futures, and purpose for existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of similarities, I read that there was some controversy over the extent to which director Duncan Jones had paid homage to Sci-Fi films of the past (e.g., 2001 A Space Odyssey, Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy).  He intended them as homages, but some perceived them as theft.  Moon has its own character(s) and fresh storyline, and the homages are made very obvious and don’t add anything of significance to the storyline, so I don’t think they are offensive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Moon was enjoyable, with a storyline that engaged me not only in the plot, but also in further thought.  Win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further reading…&lt;/p&gt;

One of the best popular science books I have read in a long time - informative, eye-opening, thought-provoking and funny. Somehow I missed finding time to read her second (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spook-Science-Afterlife-Mary-Roach/dp/0393329127" title=""&gt;Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife&lt;/a&gt; - I guess just not a topic I care much about), but when her third book came out, with such a provocative title as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bonk-Curious-Coupling-Science-Sex/dp/0393334791" title=""&gt;Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex&lt;/a&gt;, I could not resist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was not disappointed. It is informative, eye-opening, thought-provoking and funny. The language we use to talk about sex (and death) is so rich, and so full of thinly (or thickly) veiled allusions, that playing with that language is easy. Puns and double-entendres come off effortlessly and yet never seem to grow old. And the effect of interspersing serious discussion of science with what amounts to, essentially, Kindergarten humor, makes the humor effective. I guess it is the effect of surprise. The same humor in a different context (or outside of any context) may not be as effective or funny. The book made me laugh out loud on many occasions, startling the other B-767 passengers on the trans-Atlantic flight a couple of weeks ago (if it was B-777, as American Airlines promised, I would have slept, but the smaller airplane made that impossible, so I read about sex instead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should not point out any specific examples of research described in the book - there's so much of it - as I don't want to take the wind out of Scicurious' sails: she uses the book as a starting point for many of her &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/friday_weird_science/" title=""&gt;Friday Weird Science&lt;/a&gt; posts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will not even attempt to write a real book review (see the review by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/01/friday_weird_science_has_found.php" title=""&gt;Scicurious&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/10/the-curious-coupling-of-science-and-sex/" title=""&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/13/bonk-reading-schedule/" title=""&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on The &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/23/sex-in-the-machine-our-first-romp-with-bonk-2/" title=""&gt;Intersection&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I will mention something that I kept noticing over and over again in each chapter. An obsession of mine, or a case of a person with a hammer seeing nails everywhere, you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the history of science shows a trajectory of ever improving standards of research, more and more stringent criteria for statistics and drawing conclusions from the data, more and more stringent ethical criteria for the use of animal and human subjects in research, etc. As the time goes on, the results of scientific research are becoming more and more reliable (far from 100%, of course, but a huge improvement over Aristotle, Galen or the Ancient Chinese who could write down their wildest ideas with authoritative flair).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the language of science has become, over time, more and more technical and unintelligible to a lay reader. The ancient 'scientific' and 'medical' scripts, the books of 300 years ago, the Letters to the Academy of 200 years ago, the early scientific papers of 100 years ago - all of those were readable and understandable by everyone who could read. Of course, in the past, only the most educated sliver of the society was literate. Today, most people are literate (ignoring some geographical difference in the rates of literacy for the moment). But even the most educated sliver of the society, unless they are experts in the same scientific field, cannot understand a scientific paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as the science gets ever more reliable through history, it also becomes less and less understandable to an educated lay reader. Why is that so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the educated lay reader &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; the intended audience for the scientific and medical writings. Today, the intended audience are colleagues. The papers are hidden behind paywalls and accessible only to people in big First World research institutions where the libraries have sufficient funds to pay for journal subscriptions. The communication to the lay audience is relegated to the non-experts: the media (which does an awful job of it) and science writers (who often do a great job, but their audience is severely limited to self-selected science aficionados).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been wondering for a while now (see the end of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/12/the_scientific_paper_past_pres.php" title=""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for an early example - and we had an entire session on the topic at ScienceOnline'09) if Open Access and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/measuring_scientific_impact_wh.php" title=""&gt;new metrics&lt;/a&gt; (that include media/blog coverage, downloads and bookmarks - all requiring that as many people as possible can understand the paper itself) will prompt authors of scientific papers to write keeping broader audiences in mind. Even if the "Materials and Methods" and "Results" sections need to remain technical, perhaps the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion (and in more and more journals also the "Author's Summary") will become more readable? At least the titles should be clear - and sometimes funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I asked (on Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook - but FriendFeed, again, proved to be the best platform for this kind of inquiry) for examples of witty, normal-language titles of scientific papers. You can see some &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/coturnix/b15ef014/collecting-funniest-silliest-most-irreverent" title=""&gt;responses here&lt;/a&gt; and everyone reminded me of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbirofl.com/" title=""&gt;NCBI ROFL&lt;/a&gt;, the blog that specializes in finding wacky papers with wacky titles. Many, but certainly not all, of such titles indeed cover the science of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see this trend towards abandoning unreadable scientese (at least in titles) happening now or in the near future? Is it more likely to happen in OA journals? Do you have good examples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, watch Mary Roach - see why humor is an important aspect of science communication to lay audiences:&lt;/p&gt;

You might know the name already - he's wrote a book a couple of years back: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Forbidden Fruit: Sex and Religion in the Lives of American Teenagers&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his latest paper, he (along with grad student Charles Stokes) has analysed data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. What he was looking at was differences between the child's rating of the importance of religion and their parent's rating. He also looked at how often they went to church, compared with their parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he fed this into a model, along with a bunch of other demographic factors, to see how they related to the child's report of parent-child relations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he found was very specific. Family harmony is hurt if the child is less religious than their parent, but not if the child is more religious than their parent. What's more, church attendance doesn't factor - it doesn't really affect family harmony if the child doesn't go to church, what matters is whether they think their religion is important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Regnerus puts it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our findings strongly suggest that those parents who care about religion appear to be frustrated with their children who do not, creating an environment with both opportunities for conflict and for inscribing 'normal' conflict with religious meaning. And the greater the magnitude of the discord, the more intense is the negative sentiment from child to parent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst problems occurred in families where parent and child differed by at least 2 points on a 5-point scale (so, for example the parent reports religion as 'very important' while the child reports it as 'fairly unimportant'). Eleven percent of American children fall into the category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's important not to get this out of proportion, however. Religious differences are one of many factors in the model, and all of them combined only explain about 10-15% of the variation in family strife. So most family strife is due to something else!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what about in the reverse direction? It seems that children who are much more religious than their parents don't face the same barriers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regnerus doesn't really speculate on why this might be - except to suggest that religions teens may make more effort to live in harmony/be obedient to their parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I reckon that it's more likely to be due to differences between atheist parents and religious parents. For a start, most people are religious in the USA, but there are few atheists. So maybe atheist parents are less freaked out by their kids taking up religion because it doesn't seem so weird.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then too, atheists are different to the religious. They are more likely to be college educated, and to have more liberal, freethinking views. Religion, especially in the USA, is more attractive to those who tend to see the world in terms of polar opposites, rather than shades of grey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here's a question to the readers of this blog. How would &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; feel if your kids (OK, you may have to use your imagination here) became fervently religious? Do you try to shield them from religion?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would you send them to an atheist summer camp? Would you be more likely to if they failed to 'see the light'?&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Social+Science+Research&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.ssresearch.2008.05.002&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=When+faith+divides+family%3A+Religious+discord+and+adolescent+reports+of+parent%E2%80%93child+relations%E2%98%86&amp;amp;rft.issn=0049089X&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=38&amp;amp;rft.issue=1&amp;amp;rft.spage=155&amp;amp;rft.epage=167&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0049089X08000628&amp;amp;rft.au=Stokes%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Regnerus%2C+M.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Social+Science%2CReligion"&gt;Stokes, C., &amp;amp; Regnerus, M.

As was pointed out to me by &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;a friend&lt;/a&gt;, if you plug the phrase "carne asada" into Google it translates it as "pot roast."  Pot roast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pot roast?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POT ROAST?!?!?!?!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't this pot roast:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is carne asada:&lt;/p&gt;

First Ned. I see the crowd of campers and parents and counselors, the trunks and sleeping bags. “Bye-bye, Ned!” we say. Alex says, “Bye, Ned!” and they hug. Then we drive somewhere else and do the same thing with Alex. “Bye! Bye! Bye!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/nedcamp.jpg" alt="Ned on his way to camp" width="360" height="480"&gt;Then we drive away in a newly empty car. We drive immediately to a hotel near a beach where our room faces the ocean. There is a masseuse available 16 hours a day, so if you can’t sleep you can book a soothing massage. There’s a full-service salon with similar hours. Usually, just as I’m deciding between pedicure and aromatherapy massage, I drift off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning half my reverie came true. We took Ned to a sidewalk crowded with campers and parents and counselors, and left him on the bus. He was making friends with counselors and showing off. “Bye, Ned,” I said, thinking I’d have a last hug or kiss. “Bye,” he said, without getting up. “Maybe I’ll write you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all, as Jeff would say, some different from taking Alex to the camp departure. First, there’s a long check-in line for campers (almost all of them) who need to have their medications and prescriptions signed in by the nurse. Then there’s a lot of waiting around before kids get on the bus. Finally Alex is seated, and my last look at him is his little white face, peering out the window, staring, wondering (I think) what the week ahead will be like, when he’ll come home again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, we’ll get to see how Alex feels about going to sleepaway camp. For now, it’s one down, one left, and hoping that the next good-bye session will go as smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is pretty lame, and I have it on good authority that Tudge wrote it in about &lt;em&gt;two months&lt;/em&gt; to meet the May deadline for the big NYC unveiling, after other authors had refused the offer to write it.  The rush job shows.  In my opinion, &lt;em&gt;The Link &lt;/em&gt;is neither worth buying nor reading, though the fossil is certainly worth seeing because it is so complete, preserving outlines of the fur and even the stomach contents. (You can see it for free on &lt;a href="http://www.revealingthelink.com/"&gt;“The Link” website&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .The buzz around Ida may in fact mark a watershed moment in science reporting: the merging of science journalism and tabloid journalism. On the whole, there isn’t much difference between Ida’s press releases and the &lt;em&gt;National Enquirer, &lt;/em&gt;with Ida playing the role of Paris Hilton: an attractive specimen that adds little to our culture. To a scientist, statements like this — made by one of Ida’s discoverers — grate like fingernails on a blackboard: “When we publish our results it will be like an asteroid hitting the Earth.” But in the end, it’s not so much the hype and the absence of scientific &lt;em&gt;gravitas &lt;/em&gt;around Ida that bothers me, it’s the irresponsibility of trying to gull the public into accepting a scientific conclusion that wasn’t properly vetted by scientists. This end run around the scientific community is the kind of thing that creationists do. Fortunately, real science has won out — for now. When Chris Beard, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was asked to assess Ida, he remarked dryly, “This fossil has been hailed as the eighth wonder of the world. Frankly, I’ve got ten more in my basement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was a very junior lawyer and he was following a case I was working on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not a libel case, and he was curious about certain basic points of law and procedure. He then signed for me a copy of his then just published biography about the personality central to the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week Tom Bower scored a fantastic libel victory - and he has now written a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/26/tom-bower-diary-richard-desmond"&gt; wonderful account&lt;/a&gt; of his defeat of the awful Richard Desmond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it is a technical point about the case which interests me here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of many interesting features about libel law is the elephant trap of pleaded meanings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a libel claim is threatened, and sometimes even when it is launched, the claimant "bigs up" the alleged meaning of the words complained of, to make the libel sound as serious as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is all very well - when the claim succeeds, or if the case settles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, if a claim is defeated, the "bigged-up" alleged meaning is still there - undefeated - to haunt the claimant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Desmond is now in this position. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The passage in Mr Bower's book about which Mr Desmond complained was:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Rumours of a crisis [within Black's firm Hollinger] reached Richard Desmond, the owner of Express Newspapers in London. Desmond shared a printing plant with the Telegraph, which had led to an argument and a court case two years earlier between himself and Black. At the end of the trial the judge, Sir Andrew Morritt, had declared Desmond's evidence to be unreliable and found in Black's favour. Now Desmond ordered the Daily Express to report that Hollinger was '"facing its biggest crisis ever" after a credit facility was cancelled by its bankers'. Black was horrified … To protect himself and suppress the truth, he sued Desmond and the Express for libel. 'There is no cash crisis, nor any prospect of one,' he said in a short statement. To rapidly defuse the row, a mediator was appointed and Black and Desmond were told to go into a room and hammer out a deal … [Eventually] a settlement was agreed, accepting Black's insistence that there was no financial crisis. Victory against Desmond, a tough operator, vindicated Black's remorseless pursuit of challengers. Grinding his critics into the dust had never failed."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We often don't get pleaded meanings in case reports. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/667.html"&gt; Court of Appeal decision&lt;/a&gt; on excluding "similar fact" evidence of Desmond wrongly influencing editorial decisions (the evidence was eventually not excluded, and the rulings of Mr Justice Eady were overturned, and see the article &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2009/jul/23/richard-desmond-express-newspapers"&gt; on the evidence which remained excluded&lt;/a&gt;), Mr Desmond said the alleged defamatory meaning of the passage just quoted was:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"that motivated entirely by his personal desire to get revenge against Conrad Black for losing an earlier court battle with him, the Claimant had directly ordered the Editor of the Daily Express to run a horrifically damaging story about Mr Black's (and Hollinger's) financial dealings, wholly indifferent as to whether the story was in fact true or false, in a vindictive and completely unjustified attempt to damage Mr Black's reputation and that despite his reputation for being a tough businessman and the fact that the story was actually true, the Claimant allowed himself to be ground into the dust by Mr Black by accepting an abject and humiliating settlement."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serious allegations indeed: just count the colourful words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this meaning, Mr Desmond lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His defeat does not, by itself, make the statements in the pleaded meaning necessarily true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be that the jury held that Mr Bower "justified" the meaning alleged by Mr Desmond; or that the jury felt the passage in the book was not a libel in the first place; or that Bower's alternative pleaded meaning was true:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"(a) the Claimant, [who treated Express Newspapers as his personal vehicle to serve his own agenda,] dictated that Lord Black and Hollinger, against whom he bore a grudge, be the subject of damaging attacks, not caring about the truth and fairness of what was written; and&lt;br&gt;(b) the Claimant, having insisted upon Lord Black and Hollinger being attacked by Express Newspapers to satisfy his own animus against Lord Black, climbed down when in the presence of Lord Black at a mediation of Hollinger's libel claim, allowed himself to be taken in by Lord Black's assurances of the financial health of Hollinger and submitted his newspaper to a public settlement that gave vindication to Lord Black's pursuit of his critics."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The newspaper reports are simply not clear as to the basis of the jury's decision, and I was not in court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a strident plea of meaning like that of Mr Desmond is sometimes dangerous, especially when it being used for tactical purposes at the start of a case, and it can end up discrediting the claimant all the more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So a bad day for Mr Desmond; and a good day for Mr Bower and investigative journalism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/Smyrq2bGGpI/AAAAAAAAALs/YefoIBl4n7M/s1600-h/Tom-Bower2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:265px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/Smyrq2bGGpI/AAAAAAAAALs/YefoIBl4n7M/s400/Tom-Bower2.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-2633101849056162519?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248635565606"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8452">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dfdead1d86533af8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Stalkers</title><published>2009-07-26T19:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T19:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8452" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us have had a stalker, or two. Perhaps the stalker was online, or in real life. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; were the stalker…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best worst stalker was a fellow I met online. A vague friendship soon turned into an obsession. He found my phone numbers and called. Continuously. He emailed me. Continuously. He contacted me using bogus accounts, posing as an admirer to gauge my responses. He was a troll on my mailing lists, discussion boards and forums. He used email programs to pose as me in correspondence. He hacked into my accounts, and cracked my passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he’d tell me he loved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relationship inside his head lasted for years. To this day, I know he still keeps a cyber eye on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hi there, Ted!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your stalker story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's finally here! Awhile ago, the youtube user Thunderf00t (most well known for his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=AC3481305829426D"&gt;Why do people laugh at creationists?&lt;/a&gt; series and smackdowns of VenomfangX), who I'll call TF for the sake of brevity, took up Ray Comfort's (the banana is proof of God and Peanut Butter disproves evolution guy) challenge to a debate. After Ray initially balked and wanted $10,000 for it, he eventually gave in. And now the discussion &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2FskTKrx40"&gt;is online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Gets out the a bottle of liquor and prepares for the stupid fest*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right off the bat, Ray shoves his foot in his mouth:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Why the name Thunderf00t? I mean, is it African-American?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;WTF? Does he mean “Native American”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When TF says it came from his online capture-the-flag games which he used Thunderf00t as his character name, Ray immediately poisons the well saying&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;I thought it was because you liked stomping on Christians&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yep. Rational discussion right there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only 51 seconds in and there's 9 10 minute videos like this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Takes a shot*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 2:12 in, Ray starts making his unsubstantiated claims:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;I know [what happened in the beginning]. You don't know. I know what was in the beginning. “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” You don't know. I do.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;By 7:03, Ray's chastising TF for our generation thinking they're right. As if that doesn't apply to his claims as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9:42 comes along and Ray makes it pretty clear that he's not listening and is just hammering his talking points. He keeps beating on about how this universe is a &lt;i&gt;creation&lt;/i&gt;, even after TF has pointed out that that's an assumption that Ray has not supported. But Ray just keeps pounding it with his strawman of “nothing” creating something. Yet TF has never once made this claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10:16: Ray claims that TF's position is “all these things [that] happened by sheer accident, that they just formed by themselves...”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that's not bad enough, Ray's claiming it's “intellectually dishonest” to admit “we just don't know.” Since when is admitting the limits of knowledge “intellectually dishonest”?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wX0pHHidY&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_832007&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1:00 Ray's claiming DNA is “language” and using the writing in the sand analogy. TF points out that another form of the argument Ray's using is “paintings have painters....”. TF points out that there's a reason Ray can claim this (which Ray calls “common sense”). TF points out that he can make this claim because we've seen people paint paintings. Ray counters that he'd never need to see someone actually paint to know paintings were painted because he'd know it just wouldn't “happen by itself.” (Sounds like &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2007/05/ray-comfort-and-kirk-cameron-are-liars.html"&gt;what I said&lt;/a&gt; watching another video with Ray.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF asks if “rainbows just happened by themselves.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray's response is priceless: “No. God created them. *smug smile* I know. Says it in scripture.” Ray also claims that God creates the rain as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When confronted with a completely naturalistic explanation for rain, Ray then cops out, effectively saying, “Well God still did it.” Even snow: Goddidit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By 4:05, TF finally gets to the point that Ray is beating around: “So you're asking, can I violate the Law of Conservation of Energy?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray says of course he can't: “You can't make anything from nothing.” Back to beating on his assumption of “nothing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray then attempts to say that, no matter what, TF can't know there's no evidence for God because you'd have to know everything to know that, of course failing to realize that since he doesn't have omniscience either, this applies to his claim of knowledge as well. But that's ok. Because the Bible tells him everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, at 6:40, Ray is finally able to get to his next talking point after spending several minutes trying to change the topic before TF can make a full answer (Gish Gallop much?). His next claim: Man is different than animal because we are a “moral” creature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF's response is to point out that many of our morals are dependent on just how society will permit it and whether or not a behavior will cause the extinction of the civilization. Simple explanation, no need for additional causes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLg7TPYbdBI&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_234774&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;0:43 – Ray quickly changes the subject again without bothering to address TF's points. Next subject: Where do people go when they die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, TF calls Ray on the assumption that they “go” anywhere. Ray dances around invoking the “soul” and then equivocates it with “life” with &lt;i&gt;absolutely&lt;/i&gt; no basis for doing so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 2:40 Ray invokes an argumentum ad populum saying that since most people believe in afterlives, that should be the default state of assumption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4:30, Ray's claiming that his interpretation of the scriptures must be right because “it's clear to [him].”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 5:38, Ray makes a really weird claim.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;I know God in the same way I know my wife. It's an intimate relation, relationship with her.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Woah there buddy. Don't need to know what goes on behind closed doors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB8A-QIQ_w4&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_622880&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of this section is TF talking about how, from a psychological standpoint, people are tuned to follow an “alpha figure” and when they do, it gives them happiness and comfort via a placebo effect. This was in response to Ray's claiming that, because he woke up one night and acceptance of God suddenly dawned on him and made him feel good, that God must be real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jauUjxWpcyc&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_583883&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray leads this part off asking if TF is using this to imply that people are easily deceived. TF replies that he does, and Ray would have to agree with this by saying everyone not following his religion are being deceived by other religions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF admits that even he can be easily deceived as well, but reiterates his point that people will believe and act in ways that don't necessarily follow logic (such as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment"&gt;Milgram experiment&lt;/a&gt;) when given authority figure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 8:18 TF asks a question that surprised me, because it's answer should have been so expected coming from Ray. TF asks “What other definition is there for “morality” [besides what benefits and creates a stable society]?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray instantly claims that TF has no absolute morality (although in part 4, TF stated clear as day that he did because there are &lt;i&gt;absolute&lt;/i&gt; limits on actions that will not create the extinction of a society, thus making it obvious again, that Ray isn't listening and just hammering his points) and that he does have another, better definition: The 10 Commandments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE1yLk75Aew&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_423341&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray's first question in this section is if TF had to choose whether to save his “rotten neighbor” or his dog from drowning, who would he save? TF answers that he would save the dog because he doesn't feel any empathy for someone who's his enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think a better answer would be “define 'rotten'.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next topic: abortion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray immediately tries to get TF to admit that “life” starts at conception. TF tries to remind him that it's not self viable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF then asks, whether or not a zygote that develops into a fetus without a head, it would still have the soul that's so important to Ray. Ray gives an honestly incredulous, “I don't know. I have no idea.” But before even considering the question, he goes, “But it's dead.” His reasoning? “If it hasn't got a head, it's dead.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF tries to explain it, but Ray quickly ducks away hiding behind the Bible saying “the Bible speaks of a woman being 'with child' again and again. It doesn't say with fetus or with cells.” Thus, anything (unless without a head) is a child because the Bible doesn't contain any mention of anything else (not that they'd have known about it 2000 years ago).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF goes back to the point that there's no distinguishable difference between the good feelings one gets following a “phantasmal” authority figure as Ray does following his God. TF asks how Ray can distinguish between the two since the results are apparently identical. Instead of answering, Ray goes on a rant about idolatry and drags Dawins' understanding of God into it. Not letting him get away with it, TF drags Ray back to it and Ray responds with the usual, “Bible says so.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At that point, they start discussing how to conclude which leads us to&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKJUnZRptIM&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_193291&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They go back to the topic at the end of the last one on distinguishing “mental teddy bears” vs God. Ray's only answer is that it's in the Bible, so God is real so he's following that to get eternal life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF asks if eternal life would really be a blessing or a curse. Ray immediately answers it would be the greatest of blessings because “We live in a fallen creation. Everything is futile. We're about to die, every one of us. Look in the mirror, things are degenerating. The future is bleak...”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF interrupts and says that the future is bright because of the accumulation of knowledge. This is an interesting split between the two which shows where their focus lies. To Ray, he's only good because God says so and he wants eternal life for &lt;i&gt;himself&lt;/i&gt;. He doesn't seem to genuinely care about others, but only does so because God tells him to, so he fakes it. TF meanwhile, actually cares about the improvement of the species. The question of what's in it for him after he dies doesn't even seem to cross his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, it's clear who has more mettle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF then points out that the retarding of knowledge Ray does by sowing disinformation about evolution is what gets him so irate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray claims that evolution is “just a theory” and that there's “no species to species transitions in the fossil record.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh the willful ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Takes a shot*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray then vacillates about “kinds” and how he has no reason to believe in evolution because the Bible doesn't say so. As much as I've debated and watched Creationists, it still amazes me that they obsess themselves with “Truth”, yet can't be bothered to pull their heads out of the Bible long enough to look at reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 5:11, Ray says something amazing&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;You can tie me in knots with evolution, but I don't believe it.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: All the facts of the world could be against me, but I won't believe it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This comes right down to the core of Creationist belief. Evidence and reality aren't important to them. This is why we &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; keep these people out of schools. They're dangerous to knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray then equivocates about TF's “faith in the word of man.” No mention of all the evidence. It can all be lumped together as “faith” and then compared to the “faith” of having absolutely no evidence at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF goes on to give a functional definition of speciation so Ray can't wiggle out of it anymore. He then gives an example of some salamanders that are genetically isolated by a mountain range who can no longer inter breed. Ray claims it's “not evolution” and that the salamanders “have an infertility problem.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wut?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray even admits that you can breed dogs far enough apart that they can't interbreed, but that has nothing to do with evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*headdesk*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF points out that that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; speciation and Ray &lt;i&gt;even admits it&lt;/i&gt;. But then demands something “not reproducing after its own kind.” Whatever the hell a “kind” is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray admits that, at that point, “you need time.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF explains that, given geological time that's not a problem. Ray keeps on with the equivocating about belief and when TF reminds him that a four and a half billion year old Earth is what the evidence supports, Ray just responds with, “So you believe.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Yep. Damn the evidence. If I can just pretend it's 'faith' or 'belief' and drag them down to my playing field, I can win.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It really is futile to argue with these people (for the sake of convincing them. I think it's perfectly reasonable to debate them to show &lt;i&gt;others&lt;/i&gt; just how intellectually challenged they are). As the saying goes, “Don't argue with an idiot. They'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJU-AcC1kLA&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_358888&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start off this part, Ray invokes &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager"&gt;Pascal's Wager&lt;/a&gt;. TF's response is one of the cleverest I've seen. He points out the premise is that the consequence is infinitely bad, such that we should believe in God even if it's the slightest chance that he might actually exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TF poses another such scenario: That of a rhino running around at the speed of light. If someone gets hit, relativistic effects would be such that they'd be stuck in that moment of agony for eternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray's response is that “the chance of that happening are totally unreasonable.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Way to miss the analogy, Ray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can't actually consider how unlikely his God is because “this creation &lt;i&gt;screams&lt;/i&gt; to me there's a Creator.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as we've already seen, Ray hasn't looked around enough to actually make an honest statement about whether it's possible to explain “creation” without a “Creator.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Ray keeps hammering on about the Bible, at 6:17, TF pulls out his bible, stuck full of little blue sticky tags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC8fuTfVWTg&amp;amp;annotation_id=annotation_785345&amp;amp;feature=iv"&gt;PART 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray says that it's impossible to understand the Bible without the holy spirit. In other words, you have to accept it as true without question, before you can see it's truth. I'd think that an all powerful God would be able to come up with a better method of communication than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one point, Ray acknowledges that there's a lot of things in the Bible he doesn't understand. Yet he continues to have unyielding faith in it? And he claims to preach it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, I don't think Ray makes a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; salient point without having to resort to “the Bible says so.” Given he has to rely on this every few minutes, I think it's safe to say that Thunderf00t completely humiliated him. Of course, those that think such answers are acceptable will disagree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: Looks like &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/05/bye-venomfang.html"&gt;I was right&lt;/a&gt;. VenomfangX is back and adding his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwEr_Eo8I9E"&gt;worthless, hypocritical, .02&lt;/a&gt; Willing to bet my comment doesn't make it through "moderation".&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5386670152382270123?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248631960468"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8472">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6644688e707b3157</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meta Stuff"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="ray comfort"/><category term="thunderf00t"/><title type="html">Happy Birthday &amp;amp; A YouTube Gift</title><published>2009-07-26T18:08:52Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T18:08:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8472" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, did you know it’s Skepchick Jen’s birthday today? Well, you do now. Wish her well in the comments and/or on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/antiheroine"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! I met Jen for the first time two weeks ago, when she magically appeared in my wedding party, and she was an incredible, vibrant, smart woman who I can’t wait to meet again. In the meantime, I’ll just continue to enjoy her excellent work on the Skepchick Quickies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only present I have for her is also a present for all of you — though, like a lottery ticket, I’m not sure whether or not it’s a good one. Thunderf00t, the YouTuber &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4996"&gt;we’ve mentioned before on Skepchick&lt;/a&gt;, ventured out to California to sit down with &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z-OLG0KyR4"&gt;Ray “Handle My Banana” Comfort&lt;/a&gt;. They had a conversation and the entire thing was uploaded to YouTube, sans edits so that the viewers could decide who came across saner.&lt;/p&gt;

People will argue over the definition of human nature, but regardless of what people think or say, it is reasonable to assume that all humans share a psychological and developmental framework to the extent that any two people raised in the same background will 'turn out' similar with respect to several behavioral traits or tendencies.  Also, a pair of twins separated at birth and raised up in very different cultures are likely to exhibit more differences than similarities owing to the different cultures but perhaps some set of seemingly uncanny similarities owing to their parentage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/reading_human_nature.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/reading_human_nature.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/69Bx1vpaj54" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248631493644"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/26/the-sunday-snog-3/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e73434a824211f09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="lions"/><category term="The Sunday Snog"/><title type="html">The Sunday Snog</title><published>2009-07-26T17:36:31Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T17:36:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/26/the-sunday-snog-3/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wildlife photographer &lt;a href="http://nicolasdevos.com/"&gt;Nicolas Devos&lt;/a&gt; has generously contributed this week’s featured photo from the Kalahari, South Africa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;My college admissions essay said it all — if only I had stopped and listened to myself at the time. I was more concerned with finding a hook that would set me apart from the tens of thousands of other applicants, who were, of course, trying to do the same thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;At my affluent public high school, potential pre-meds and Wall Streeters (yes, at age 17) lined the hallways. Foreign languages were a more unlikely passion. So I seized on that, choosing to narrate my journey from middle-school Francophilia to full-blown foreign grammar nerd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Looking through the brochures accumulated on endless campus visits, I didn’t find many schools that offered bachelor’s degrees to people who studied a random assortment of languages, and wanderlust made me reluctant to choose one. But most offered a major in something called linguistics. Maybe by professing my appetite for such a charmingly obscure course of study, I could win over the admissions officers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got her into Yale (though I suspect there were a few other factors). Anyhow, in the end, this self-presentation strategem worked out for her in other ways. She surprised herself by actually majoring in linguistics, and was seduced by her senior thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“You know,” my friend David said, “this research is just about the only thing I’ve ever heard you talk about with any sort of enthusiasm or passion . . . except for, like, partying or the Giants or something. Why don’t you go get a Ph.D.?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“I — but — ” I stuttered. Graduate school? Me? I’ve never been particularly academic. My parents weren’t academics. As a staunch commitment-phobe, I thought devoting one’s whole life to the study of some minute cluster of phenomena was utterly unfathomable. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized David had a point. There was nothing in college I cared about so deeply as this. I felt indignant; research had sneaked up on me. Who would have thought that I would discover, in February of senior year, that what I was majoring in was actually what I was interested in? I think Professor Piñango saw it coming before I did. The following Monday, I was anxious to share what I had termed my quarter-life crisis. I burst dramatically into her office.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“You know what I realized? I really like this stuff!” I exclaimed. “I can work on it for hours on end and it never feels like a chore.” She was unfazed. “Yeah? So? Go to grad school.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I think I will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own reasons for majoring in linguistics were even more accidental. I entered college with sophomore standing, and so I had to declare a major right away. I wanted to major in math, but this required an interview with the department chair, Prof. Gleason, who was distinctly not encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tell me, young man," he said, peering at me coldly over the top of his glasses, "what new theorems have you proved?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well&amp;quot;, I said, taken aback, &amp;quot;just the ones I was assigned for homework, or on tests. But those weren&amp;#39;t new, I guess…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exactly," he said. "As a rule, we find that mathematical talent shows itself early. So if you haven't made an original contribution by the time you enter college, the chances are that you won't ever do so. I tell you this for your own good."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt somewhat disappointed, since no one had told me before that perfect scores on the SAT mathematics and AP calculus exams were an inadequate qualification for undergraduate study in mathematics. But I could take a hint, and so I decided to seek my fortune elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next idea was &amp;quot;applied mathematics&amp;quot;, which was a separate department. But as I recall, you couldn&amp;#39;t major in plain &amp;quot;applied mathematics&amp;quot;, it had to be &amp;quot;X and applied mathematics&amp;quot;, for some value of X. Looking at the alternatives, I stumbled on a magnificent loophole in the general education requirements — the authorities were apparently unsure where linguistics belonged in the Great Chain of Academic Being, and so any linguistics course could be counted against the requirements in natural science, social science, or humanities, at the student&amp;#39;s discretion. Even though I fully intended to take courses in all of those areas, the opportunity to do so without compulsion was irrationally irresistible. So I signed up as a major in &amp;quot;linguistics and applied math&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some twists and turns, this worked out as well for me as it seems to be doing for Ms. Finn. Her description is a pretty good recommendation, don't you think? "I can work on it for hours on end and it never feels like a chore."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard from others that Andrew Gleason's advice to me was his standard speech in those days to would-be math majors. Years later, I found myself on the same conference program with him (it was an event in honor of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Metropolis"&gt;Nicholas Metropolis&lt;/a&gt;), and I teased him a bit about this advice. He explained that he regarded undergraduate majors as an unwelcome distraction, for the most part, and also felt that encouraging less talented students to pursue the subject did them no favor, given the poor job market for professional mathematicians. If I'd come in as a freshman, I probably would have learned enough in my first year to ignore his advice, if I really wanted to. Anyhow, no regrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For college-bound high school students, that long-closed general-education loophole still has a useful moral. As a &amp;quot;linguist&amp;quot;, you can work in areas that span the disciplinary spectrum: mathematics, natural science, social science, humanities, medicine, public policy, engineering, … So if you like the idea of not having to specialize too narrowly, or you&amp;#39;re having a hard time making up your mind, give us a look. (Of course, a positive interest in some aspects of speech, language and communication is also a plus — but most people qualify on that dimension.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248629787874"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/home_alone.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03e1235f37a1bd96</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Home alone</title><published>2009-07-26T18:19:20Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T18:19:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pcyGKLhFBYU/home_alone.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/home_alone.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been abandoned.

&lt;p&gt;The Trophy Wife has gone to summer camp!

&lt;p&gt;I'd say that I should get her to send me daily updates on the events there, but I think she's going to be busy.

That wouldn’t be newsworthy &lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/671729"&gt;except for the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… there is no shortage of atheists in the world, but precious few of them were born into the family of a conservative rabbi and raised in what many would consider a stifling domain, the austere, God-fearing world of the haredim, as ultra-Orthodox Jews are known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah is a rarity in Israel. She is a “yotze,” the term used here for someone who has left the haredi world behind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s extremely courageous for Sarah to come out as an atheist when you consider the strict world she’s leaving behind.  She is refusing to have an arranged marriage at a young age, she is refusing to have a quiverfull of children, she is refusing to wear mandatory headgear, and she is refusing to obey any rabbi.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lot to say no to, and it’s admirable that she’s done what so many other women in her position might not be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While her family didn’t completely abandon her, they weren’t happy with her decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… her departure was a wrenching affair, and she went for several years without communicating with her parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just stopped talking to them,” she says. “It was easier for everybody.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has since gotten back in contact with them, and they’re working things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/671729"&gt;What a powerful story&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hope other girls in Sarah’s position get a chance to read this and see that, even though it may be rough, it is possible to leave the faith.  You don’t need religion dictating your lifestyle.  Having the freedom to do as you wish a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

None.  When you read statements from many representatives, you see such simplistic, anhistoric thinking that pessimism about health care reform is the only logical response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so it seems from media reports.   The New York Times, whose quality seems to be dropping by the femtosecond, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/25/health/policy/25doctors.html?em"&gt;reported this week&lt;/a&gt; on salaried vs. traditionally paid physicians. This could have been a terrific article, if the reporter knew anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me catch you up a bit.  Doctors are generally paid in one of two ways.  They are either salaried employees of a health care system, or they are on their own, billing insurers and patients for the services they provide.  For the latter, it is not precisely true, as the Times reports, that, "the more procedures and tests they order, the more money they pocket."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perspective on this is pretty intimate, as I have two jobs; one in which I'm salaried, the other in which I'm a traditional fee-for-service private practice doc.  In my private practice, I am paid a modest fee for seeing a patient.  If I order one of the few tests I offer in my office, such as an EKG or a chest X-ray, I can bill for that as well.  But the fees are pretty much set.  Medicare decides what "fair" reimbursement is, and the rest of the insurers follow suit.  If my rent goes up, I cannot raise my fees.  If I want my patient to get more procedures or more tests, I can't profit from it, although I could if I owned big, fancy machines.  Doctors who own their own stress test machines, etc, can make more money, so that incentive is certainly there.  But for the average primary care physician, there is no incentive to "do lots of more".  The only incentive built into the system is to see lots of patients so that you can pay the rent.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, lest we are misunderstood or misread, we want to emphasize that this does not mean there aren’t many other forces–such as poor education and scientific illiteracy and the unreliable media–contributing to the gap between science and society. However, scientists can also be a contributing factor, as we explain in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Pew Research Center and the American Association for the Advancement of Science unveiled the latest embarrassing evidence of our nation’s scientific illiteracy. Only 52 percent of Americans in their survey knew why stem cells differ from other kinds of cells; just 46 percent knew that atoms are larger than electrons. On a highly contentious issue like global warming, meanwhile, the gap between scientists and the public was vast: 84 percent of scientists, but just 49 percent of Americans, think human emissions are causing global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are fond of citing statistics such as these in explaining conflicts between the public and the scientific community. On politicized issues like climate change, embryonic stem cell research, the teaching of evolution, and the safety of vaccines, many Americans not only question scientific expertise but even feel entitled to discard it completely. The reason, many scientists infer, is that the public is just clueless; perhaps we wouldn’t have these problems if the average citizen were better educated, more knowledgeable, better informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet while scientific illiteracy is nothing to shrug at, the truth is that it’s only part of a broader problem for which scientists themselves must shoulder a significant portion of the responsibility. Decrying ignorance and scientific illiteracy, many scientists treat their fellow citizens as empty vessels waiting for an infusion of knowledge. That is exactly wrong, and exactly why so many people, in turn, see science and scientists as distant, inscrutable, aloof, arrogant. Rather than blaming, scientists ought to be engaging with the public, trying to personally make their knowledge hit home and to instill by example (rather than from a distance) the nature and virtues of the scientific mindset - while also encouraging average Americans to ask their own questions and have their say. Scientists must make it clear that while they don’t have all the answers, science is about searching for the truth, an imperfect process of doing the best one can with the information available, while knowing there is always more to learn - the epitome of humility….&lt;/p&gt;

Hey, how about some good news on the alternative medicine front? Well, I’ve got some, along with some setbacks. But it’s mostly positive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/a_homeopathy_apologist_takes_over_the_ly.php"&gt;From Orac&lt;/a&gt;: a homeopath is tapped to run the UK’s Lymphoma Association? Note to self: do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; get sick with in London for TAM UK in October. Holy crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The Lancaster (Ohio) Eagle-Gazette &lt;a href="http://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/article/20090715/NEWS01/907150321"&gt;ran a pro-vax op-ed piece&lt;/a&gt;. Good on them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Autism Speaks has had two high-profile resignations this year, both because &lt;a href="http://skepticdetective.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/new-twist-in-autism-vaccine-saga/"&gt;the organization refuses to accept the overwhelming evidence that vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/07/20/the-backlash-against-the-anti-vax-lobby-continues/"&gt;More bad press for the Australian antivaxxers&lt;/a&gt;, who have been so successful that people Down Under — including at least one baby — have been dying. This particular page was sent to me by David McCaffery. Yes, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/antivax-kills/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; David McCaffery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(Don't worry, there'll be new insolence tomorrow.) This time, I'm feeling the love from a reader named Shawn, who, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/reader_e-mail_why_are_you_picking_on_jen.php"&gt;unlike yesterday's correspondent&lt;/a&gt;, was not polite. It's not as wingnutty as some of what P.Z gets (come on, guys, you can do better!), but it's entertaining nonetheless:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You and &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/"&gt;Stephen Barrett&lt;/a&gt; should be butt buddies. Mr quackwatch himself has been exposed as a fraud numerous times (&lt;a href="http://www.canlyme.com/quackwatch.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.canlyme.com/quackwatch.html&lt;/a&gt;) , and his rampant campaign to discredit anything that doesn't have to do with drug based "medicine" is very similar to yours. You guys are birds of the same feather: quacks! 

&lt;p&gt;Your sphere of influence is rapidly shrinking buddy. Can you feel it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, but I can feel the heat of the burning stupid emanating from your e-mail. But you did give me an opportunity to insert a link for &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt; into this post, thus doing my small part to improve its Google ranking while using the rel="nofollow" tag for any link to your favored site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, Shawn appears to be someone who frequents the &lt;a href="http://www.canlyme.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;amp;u=181&amp;amp;sid=32aa7eed833f3c6fa35e90e604723740" rel="nofollow"&gt;Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation Bulletin Board&lt;/a&gt;. If he is representative of the scintillating wit and sterling intelligence that characterizes those forums, it looks like we're looking at another Whale.to or Mothering.com. I had previously been unaware of the Canadian Lyme Disease Foundation, but, thanks to Shawn, I promise to take a look in the near future, even though looking at the dubious diagnosis of and treatment for chronic lyme disease is usually one area that I leave to my blog buds &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/town_declares_science_wrong_sc.php"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=523"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;.

scientists at Asilomar Conference Grounds on Monterey Bay in California&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=2&amp;amp;hp"&gt; discussed possible concerns &lt;/a&gt;about the future of computers - especially increasingly intelligent machines. I find this a fascinating topic. We are living through the tranformation of our civilization by information technology - and we’re only getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the points raised gave me a, “well, duh!” reaction. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discussed possible threats to human jobs, like self-driving cars, software-based personal assistants and service robots in the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New technology often threatens existing jobs. As technology advances the job market must constantly evolve to match it. But while old jobs become obsolete, the technology creates new jobs - services and utilizing the technology. It is probably safe to say that in 50 years a large portion of jobs that people hold today will no longer exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they did raise some very interesting points, and it is not too early to attempt to anticipate potential problems. For example, what if criminals get a hold of AI software that they can use to troll for personal information on the internet, or tirelessly do their nefarious tasks? The abuse of AI by criminals and terrorists is a legitimate concern, and building in safeguards could be helpful. I liken this to the problems of spam, viruses, worms, and identity theft on the internet. When the internet and then the world wide web were first being developed, these kinds of things were not anticipated. If they were perhaps more security could have been built into the basic structure of the internet. Could we be living in a spam-free world today if it were anticipated 20 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern that was raised was AI becoming more intelligent than humans. In my opinion this is inevitable. It is not a question of if but of when. Unless we go the Dune route and ban machines that mimic the mind of man, we will have machines that are smarter than humans. This is not a problem in and of itself - only if these machines go beyond our control. We certainly should not build fully self-sufficient AI military robots whose mission and capabilities extend to killing humans. That seems like an accident waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Kurzweil’s answer to this problem is that humans will merge with our machines. The AI of the future will be us - so no worries. This will likely be true to some extent, but it is difficult to say exactly how this will manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very good point I had not thought of was that we should begin an open dialogue on the issues raised by AI and computer advances before public opinion polarizes, as it has with genetically modified foods. This polarization is already happening to some degree, with “technologists” anticipating all the wonderful things this technology will do, while alarmists warn about the risks to humanity. Discussing this issue may ameliorate this polarization, or it may accelerate it. I predict the latter - because it is likely that those who are not participating in the early discussions of the impact of AI that will react fearfully when the technology starts to hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of ethical controversies are coming - what are the rights of AI, what is the definition of human, is it ethical to even turn on an AI machine? We can and should discuss these questions, and try to anticipate and head off abuses. But if history is any judge society is likely to stay one step behind the forces that are transforming it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were commenting on the Capitol Visitor Center and the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/12/god-to-be-engraved-in-visitor-center/"&gt;potential engraving&lt;/a&gt; of “In God We Trust” inside of it.  &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/14/ffrf-sues-over-in-god-we-trust-at-capitol-visitor-center/"&gt;FFRF is suing&lt;/a&gt; to stop that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does the editorial team stand on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is another case that calls for reasonableness rather than stridency. Although there is an understandable rationale for keeping phrases like “In God We Trust” in places where they’ve traditionally appeared — on, say, pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters — it hardly seems necessary to retrofit a government building at substantial cost merely to add words that might offend some people. At the same time, it’s worth noting that the defenders of secularism sometimes seem to make an inordinate fuss over minor issues (such as this one) when there are more significant battles to be fought.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*sigh*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, no.  Bad editorial board.  Bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are correct that “In God We Trust” has been on coins for a long while — since &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust#Use_on_currency"&gt;after the Civil War&lt;/a&gt; — but that’s no reason to keep them there now.  What exactly is the “understandable rationale” for keeping the phrase on our currency?  I don’t know, and they don’t say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And are defenders of secularism making too big deal about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt there are more important church/state violations.  But we should not ignore this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t (couldn’t) make a fuss when IGWT was slapped onto our money, made our national motto, and “under God” was inserted into the pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, those very things are used against us when we protest church/state violations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Capitol Visitor Center is allowed to engrave IGWT on the inside, you can bet the Religious Right will use that in the future as evidence that this is a Christian nation.  They’ll use it to justify further insertions of God into government-run projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may lose this battle, but we shouldn’t stop complaining and we need to keep the pressure up on this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to let the government know this is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about getting offended.  Atheists are used to that.  This is about a principle — keeping religion out of taxpayer-subsidized projects is good for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an embarrassing, disappointing editorial.  And this, despite the fact they come out on our side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Fidalgo&lt;/strong&gt; reminds us that this is the same &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt; that published &lt;strong&gt;Charlotte Allen&lt;/strong&gt;’s (&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/17/jews-no-jesus-no-reason-just-whining-theyre-motivated-by-anger-and-boohoo-victimhood/"&gt;truly offensive&lt;/a&gt;) anti-atheist piece a couple months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blocraison.blogspot.com/2009/07/la-times-supports-wall-misses-point.html"&gt;He adds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don’t think religious invocations should be removed from government buildings because they hurt my feelings. Hurt feelings is the rationale used by religionists when they oppose private atheistic displays. I want to keep these things separate because government support or endorsement of any kind of superstition, theology, mythology, supernatural revelation, dogma is a bad thing. It fosters sectarianism, it is exclusionary to all those who don’t subscribe to that belief or that form of theism (certainly our Hindu friends, for example, would probably like to know which god it is we are claiming to trust), it celebrates faith over factual understanding, it dilutes a commitment to science and reality, and casts as unAmerican those who do not trust in their imaginary superbeing. There is no constitutional amendment against being offended, nor should there be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very well put.  Don’t you think?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What lies ahead for Sarah Palin following her &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/us/politics/13palin.html"&gt;resignation from the governorship of Alaska&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Civil rights leader for people with intellectual disabilities," as &lt;a href="http://www.specialolympics.org/"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt; president Tim Shriver suggests in a July 23rd &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/religionfromtheheart/2009/07/the_perfect_job_for_sarah_palin.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; op-ed. This, he says, would be the "perfect job" for Sarah Palin, the mother of a young child, Trig, who has Down Syndrome; these are her "powerful credentials." Writes Shriver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a parent, imagine the attention she could help draw to challenges children with Down Syndrome face in early childhood. There are far too few early childhood centers for children with special needs, far too few day-care options, far too few preschools that accept children with Down Syndrome. Palin's name could do a lot for the cause of early childhood service improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the impact she would have if she testified before Congress about the health disparities facing children with Down Syndrome. Good medical care is difficult to get and frequently substandard. I remember one medical professional telling me that care for children with special needs was usually "quick and dirty. Get them in and get them out." Palin could expose the dirty secret that people with special needs are among the most discriminated against populations in the health care world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine Palin leading efforts to awaken her community and her country to the gifts of people with Down Syndrome. Today, when parents learn that they are carrying a child with Down Syndrome, the vast majority choose to terminate (some estimates are as high as 90%). This doesn't have to be about the legality of abortion but rather about informing prospective parents that people with Down Syndrome can lead happy and productive lives. That's a message that both the conservative Sam Brownback and the liberal Ted Kennedy have endorsed. I bet they'd both welcome Palin as a messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that some will says that Palin is "controversial to be effective in these roles," Shriver suggests that she could be "united," and suggests that she join with President Obama's Friday announcement to make the US a signatory to the 2006 &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/"&gt;United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;/a&gt;: "Couldn't Palin join with the president in helping our nation renew its global leadership for full inclusion of people with disabilities?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During last year's Presidential campaign, Palin's being the mother of a child with Down Syndrome was regularly noted. Examination of Palin's statements regarding disability suggest that, before taking a national (and, as Shriver seems to suggest, even an international) role in advocacy for individuals with disabilities, some study of disability in a broader context and of disabilities rights more generally would be helpful. In September of 2008 Palin spoke about curing "&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/palin-on-curing-dreadful-diseases-not-on-disability/"&gt;dreadful diseases&lt;/a&gt;" following a reference to "&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/sarah-palin-special-needs-mom/"&gt;special needs&lt;/a&gt;." Some more extensive comments from an &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/sarah-palin-interview-comments-on-special-needs/"&gt;October 2008 interview&lt;/a&gt; refer to Palin's views on providing "opportunities to special needs children and special needs adults also."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have been interviewed by &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/164790"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; about John McCain's pledge to help families with special needs children. In response to reporter Claudia Kalb's question "Isn't Sarah Palin a good role model for special-needs families across the country?" I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the fact that the choice of Palin brought working mothers, and especially working mothers of special-needs children, into the national discussion. And as a mother, I hesitate to criticize or judge another mother on her parenting style. But I'm concerned about the reality [she would face in] taking care of a special-needs child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while one, again, prefers to refrain from casting any judgments on other parents, and especially parents of children with disabilities, I'm not sure how Palin might be able to balance the realities of day-to-day care for a child with a disability while throwing herself, as has been speculated, into preparing for a future presidential campaign. If she can, more power to her, and many will be curious about how she manages it, and what she will be "advocating" for.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248593610420"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/perfect_pesticides_for_organic.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/061206a97a5de9d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Perfect pesticides for organic vegetable trees on the non-slavery West Coast</title><published>2009-07-26T05:36:45Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T05:36:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/7Fq-z5bfRPg/perfect_pesticides_for_organic.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/perfect_pesticides_for_organic.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Yxe_kwc8klw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0xcc2550%26color2%3D0xe87a9f&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/perfect_pesticides_for_organic.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/7Fq-z5bfRPg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248586706807"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1309367ed3452e64</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Dowsing by...iPhone</title><published>2009-07-26T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/649-dowsing-byiphone.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="iphonedowse" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/iphonedowse.jpg" width="135" height="NaN"&gt;In response to a post I saw on Twitter, I hustled over to the Apple iTune store to check the story out. Yes, indeed, there was a &lt;a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=314074433&amp;amp;mt=8"&gt;free application ("app") for a virtual dowsing rod&lt;/a&gt; (link opens in iTunes). When you launch the program, your screen shows two parallel rods over a background that looks like the ground, with grass and exposed dirt. As you tilt the phone, the rods spread or come together, and when you get a hit, the phone vibrates, buzzes, and a red light flashes. Apparently I have water in the keyboard of my Mac. Or maybe oil. I'll let you know how the drilling comes out, at which time I will be busy filling out my paperwork for the JREF Million Dollar Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so this a silly application. But I thought regular readers might get a kick out of the comments in the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this dowsing rod application when I was in the desert to find wter. An arch nemesis left me in the middle of the desert with only a bottle of motor oil, after he threw me out of the CEO position of my multi-national corporation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Naomi Baker)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248581781654"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/i_love_covers---is_that_wrong.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/902867fe21dbb954</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Narcissistic self-involvement"/><title type="html">I love covers---is that wrong?</title><published>2009-07-26T04:06:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T04:06:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/tzZbJg9XSTs/i_love_covers---is_that_wrong.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/i_love_covers---is_that_wrong.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Desire &lt;/em&gt;is a great friggin' album, and this is one of the better songs, but I never knew about this cover.

&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t know the answer… so he asks to use a lifeline.  (It’s not like the Pope would know any better.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite line from Morris is this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You know… the fact is that we don’t know *exactly* how things happened…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, religious people somehow “know” that Adam and Eve existed, and Genesis is true, and there was a talking snake, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Christians who don’t take Genesis literally “know” that God played a role in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But call them out on it — or have them explain what it is they believe — and their explanations fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris dodges the question completely by saying we don’t know what happened… and then proceeds to tell us what he believes happened.  It’s ridiculous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is probably why it’s on FOXNews to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

O'Conner and Stuart Kellerman defending singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/magazine/26FOB-onlanguage-t.html"&gt;All Purpose Pronoun&lt;/a&gt;", 7/26/2009). They lead, topically, with the value of shedding five characters from "he or she" to help stay under the limit of 140 characters per tweet. And they blame the retreat from singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; to sex-neutral &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; on Anne Fisher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If any single person is responsible for this male-centric usage, it’s Anne Fisher, an 18th-century British schoolmistress and the first woman to write an English grammar book, according to the sociohistorical linguist Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade. Fisher’s popular guide, “A New Grammar” (1745), ran to more than 30 editions, making it one of the most successful grammars of its time. More important, it’s believed to be the first to say that the pronoun &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; should apply to both sexes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minus the topical lede, much of this material is to be found in their excellent recent book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Origins-Specious-Misconceptions-English-Language/dp/1400066603/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is organized as a collection of bite-sized essays with clever heads. Specifically, this week's column draws on "To He or Not to He" (pp. 137-138), and "Gender Bending" (pp. 141-145).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Connor and Kellerman urge the anti-&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; forces ("atheyists"?) to give up their misguided and hopeless fight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Meanwhile, many great writers — Byron, Austen, Thackeray, Eliot, Dickens, Trollope and more — continued to use &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; and company as singulars, never mind the grammarians. In fact, so many people now use &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; in the old singular way that dictionaries and usage guides are taking a critical look at the prohibition against it. R. W. Burchfield, editor of The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage, has written that it’s only a matter of time before this practice becomes standard English: “The process now seems irreversible.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.) already finds the singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; acceptable “even in literary and formal contexts,” but the Usage Panel of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed.) isn’t there yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It’s a shame that grammarians ever took umbrage at the singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;. After all, they gave &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; a slide. It began life as a plural object pronoun and evolved into the whole enchilada: subject and object, singular and plural. But umbrage the grammarians took, and like it or not, the universal &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; isn’t universally accepted — yet. Its fate is now in the hands of the jury, the people who speak the language. Yes, even those who use only 140 characters a pop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit disappointing that O'Conner and Kellerman fail to &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003572.html"&gt;cite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003485.html"&gt;scripture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it would be nice if the Gray Lady's management decided to give this couple Safire's gig when he retires, assuming that Dave Barry &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001800.html"&gt;continues to hold out&lt;/a&gt;. There's a decade's worth of columns in their book, and plenty of evidence that they could spin out more as targets of opportunity arise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248574153915"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8463">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/090fea98bcd0366a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="geology"/><title type="html">Geology Word of the “Week” Triple Feature- Word I: Speleothem</title><published>2009-07-26T00:15:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-26T00:15:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8463" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4d1086e1efc1536a93f07c24cc1f272b&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing Rebecca and other skepchicks at the recent Amaz!ng Meeting 7, I realized that it’s time to start writing for Skepchick again. My geology word of the week slipped to a geology word of the month, so to make up for that I’m going to post a triple feature of geology words this week. I’ll post one word today, one on Monday, and one on Wednesday. After this kickstart, I’ll go back to my weekly word and try to write up some other skeptical tidbits now and again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the first geology word of the week is: &lt;b&gt;Speleothem&lt;/b&gt;. I was working on some speleothem samples this morning in lab, so I thought this would be a fitting word for today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been to a cave, you’ve probably seen speleothems. &lt;b&gt;Speleothem&lt;/b&gt; is an encompassing term which is used to describe all types of chemical precipitate minerals that form in caves. Speleothems generally precipitate from groundwater which has percolated through the bedrock surrounding the cave and leached various elements and compounds. When the enriched water reaches the cave, changing conditions (a large open space has very different pressure and temperature than pore spaces in bedrock) allow gases, such as carbon dioxide, to escape from the water. Evaporation can also occur. The changing composition of the water encourages the (usually very, very slow) precipitation of speleothem minerals from cave waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemically, the speleothems which form in a particular cave are similar in composition. Most caves are formed in limestone, and so the speleothems will generally be formed of calcite, the dominant mineral in limestone. However, depending on how and where the speleothem is precipitated, it can take on a variety of shapes. Scientists and other cave explorers have given different names to these various morphologies. Examples of speleothems are stalactites, stalagmites, flowstones, cave coral, cave drapery, cave curtains, and cave crystals. There are dozens of names for various cave formations, so speleothem is a nice catch-all phrase for geologists to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most speleothems form over thousands upon thousands of years. Thus, you shouldn’t touch or remove speleothems unless you’re doing so for legitimate science. Even when collecting speleothems for science, one should be conservative. Take small samples and obtain the necessary permissions. Fortunately, for my own research in Oman I am often able to collect speleothems which have fallen on the ground and are no longer growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img24.imageshack.us/i/evyspeleothem.jpg/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/1607/evyspeleothem.jpg" border="0" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture of me with a stalagmite in Oman. I didn’t sample this one, but I did sample some of its neighbors. This particular stalagmite isn’t forming in a true cave but rather in an open hallow underneath a layer of rock. Water percolated through the layer of rock and formed speleothems in the hallow underneath. I’ll try to write more about my research in Oman in coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for those of you who still confuse stalactite and stalagmite, here’s a reminder of something you probably learned in grammar school but may have forgotten by now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stala&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;tites hang tite to the &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;eiling while stala&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;mites grow up from the &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;round. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248566637598"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14134">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e454c4e5155e4e18</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">MIT’s Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values</title><published>2009-07-25T23:00:37Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T23:00:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/25/mits-dalai-lama-center-for-ethics-and-transformative-values/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Cambridge, MIT opened the &lt;a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/faith/story/839081.html"&gt;Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values&lt;/a&gt; this past spring.  It’s a bit of an old story, but I’m just coming across it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dalai Lama had some interesting soundbytes in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The majority of the 6 billion people on earth, I think, we can categorize as non-believers,” he said. “So we must find a way to promote ethics and values with these nonbelievers … We need promotion of secular ethics through education.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think he means it this way, but it’s like he’s saying we’re not capable of having ethics and morals on our own.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like religion does a good job of instilling those values.  (Do I need to make a list to prove that?  Mark Sanford.  There’s your list.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet described “secular” not as an absence of belief, but as a mode of treating belief and non-belief with equal respect
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I think he means well.  When it comes ethics and morals, certain ideas (be kind, don’t kill, Golden Rule, etc.) transcend religious beliefs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But belief and non-belief do not deserve equal respect.  People do.  Ideas don’t.  Bad ideas certainly don’t.  If you want to promote “secular ethics,” it’ll be in spite of religious belief, not because of it.  No doubt religious believers will say such goodness could not happen unless you worship their version of god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger story here, anyway, is that a university with the highest reputation of scientific integrity is joining together with a spiritual leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Buddhism has no history of conflict with science,” says B. Alan Wallace, president of the Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies. “In that regard, it may seem non-threatening to certain scientists who’ve grown very wary of Christians, who they think always have an agenda to try to plug intelligent design or their own particular theological creed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center also reflects a growing movement in higher education to explore how science and religion might be complementary, rather than perennial foes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhism has no conflict with science?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s bullshit… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhists may not believe in a creator God, but they do believe in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_%28Buddhism%29"&gt;Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, in the sense that when you die, your consciousness lives on in another form.  That directly contradicts scientific evidence.  There’s also the belief in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism"&gt;Karma&lt;/a&gt;, a “magical” energy that says what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; matters just as much as (if not more than) what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, which has no evidence to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I understand the good intent… but I’m puzzled why there’s so much deference given here to a man whose beliefs may contradict what the students and faculty already know is true.&lt;/p&gt;

In the course of doing that, I ran across a blog called &lt;a href="http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/"&gt;Theoria com Praxi&lt;/a&gt;, written by &lt;a href="http://www.shelfari.com/gbrettmiller"&gt;G. Brett Miller&lt;/a&gt; (his previous blog was &lt;a href="http://autism.gbrettmiller.com/"&gt;29 Marbles&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miller has a lot good to say, which I will get to in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Here I am at my daughter's competition. It maybe doesn't look hard: &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2006/07/jumpergirl_and_.html"&gt;go canter around and jump over fairly small obstacles 
&lt;/a&gt;
 but there a lot of separate sub-elements just having to do with riding,  steering, increasing or decreasing the rate of speed, increasing or decreasing the size of the horse&amp;#39;s stride.  Then there are the strategy elements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Miller's article on mastery really struck by this one:

&lt;a href="http://blog.gbrettmiller.com/you-dont-get-better-at-writing-essays-by-writing-more-essays/" title="Theoria cum Praxi » You don’t get better at writing essays by writing more essays"&gt;Theoria cum Praxi » You don’t get better at writing essays by writing more essays&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem is, as the title of this post hints at, that you can’t get better at something by just doing that something. The early part of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842247"&gt;Talent is Overrated &lt;/a&gt;is full of examples: Jerry Rice didn’t become the greatest football player ever by playing football games; Tiger Woods didn’t become the greatest golfer by simply playing endless rounds of golf; and Benjamin Franklin didn’t become the incredible writer that he was by writing essays. All of these people, and many more, became incredibly good at what they do (did) through deliberate practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You don't get better at jumping by jumping.  Mastery of the sub-elements is essential.

And of course the implications for k-12 education are also there.</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248560961495"><id gr:original-id="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/?p=121">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2bac77b6cb93094</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alternative Medicine"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="health care"/><category term="naturopath"/><category term="quack"/><category term="Tom Harkin"/><title type="html">Senators Want To Add CAM To Health Care Bill</title><published>2009-07-25T22:03:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T22:03:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/senators-want-to-add-cam-to-health-care-bill/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reported in the &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/07/24/senators_seek_coverage_for_alternative_therapies/"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like we have some senators who want our future health coverage, whatever it eventually turns out to be, to include coverage of complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM).  This might shock you, but I think this is incredibly stupid.  I love the idea of universal healthcare, but that is under the assumption that it’s actually real healthcare that people are getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the way that these senators are apparently trying to get CAM covered is by requiring the federal plan to cover practicioners licensed by the state they are in.  From the Globe article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Forty-four states license acupuncturists. Fifteen states, not including Massachusetts, license naturopathic physicians, who use natural remedies in their treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What!?  Fifteen states license naturopaths!?  What are they thinking?  What does it take to get licensed, and is there any reason to believe that a state-licensed naturopath deserves the same kind of insurance coverage that someone who went to medical school does?  I’ll answer that for you, NO!  Not when the &lt;a href="http://www.ncnm.edu/academics-at-ncnm/Programs_08-09.htm"&gt;accredited universities that you can get such licenses from require three quarters of homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;, a practice that has been shown over and over again to be ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what it looks like is that even though senators like Tom Harkin of Iowa want to include CAM in our national healthcare plan, the real problem exists at the state level.  The states who license naturopaths are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington., as well as Washington D.C., Peurto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  (Unsurprisingly dominated by liberal states).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in one of those places, you owe your state government a letter.&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote yesterday about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reporting_school_abuse"&gt;school abuse&lt;/a&gt; and before that about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sexual_abuse_and_safety"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt;: Safety has been on my mind a lot and then one reads about a 14-year old boy on the spectrum, Sean Carter, who was &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sexual_abuse_and_safety"&gt;severely beaten on his face and back&lt;/a&gt;. Sean's father, Ron Carter, claims that an organized gang in west Clacton is responsible, as reported in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/4510062.Autistic_boy_beaten_up_by_gang/?ref=rss"&gt;Gazette&lt;/a&gt; (UK). Now Sean is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “.....literally frightened to leave the house.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Carter no longer wants to send Sean to school because he is too afraid. He hopes to move out of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Sean had been tormented by his peers, who took advantage of his autism ever since he moved into a new class at the town’s Bishops Park College in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora has posted about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_1_of_6_violence_and_abuse"&gt;violence and abuse&lt;/a&gt; and particularly noted the "complexity of power imbalances" in such situations. She and I have both posted &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/bullying_at_any_age_is_wrong"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ben_x_and_bullying"&gt;bullying&lt;/a&gt; -- it sounds as if this had happened to Sean prior to being beaten. What did or didn't school authorities do, if anything?  Even if there were anti-bullying programs in place, these are not enough. As a commenter wrote yesterday on a post about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/reporting_school_abuse"&gt;school abuse&lt;/a&gt; and the call to form a group to create a new statewide policy on reporting abuse in the school system by Georgia governor Sonny Perdue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not just that they help some but not enough, it's that those people who work for these agencies don't really have the opportunity to say how their agency is really failing. They end up protecting the agency by continuing to sacrifice the rights of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of subtle as well as overt ways that staff members in these agencies are allowed to discourage those who have been abused from reporting it. It's important to remember that no matter what type of abuse it is, the victim first has to deal with their own shame. That's what abuse does. It makes the victim feel ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that the opportunity to report what has happened to them won't be enough. They need to be in an environment where they are encouraged and empowered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping that Sean can find a better place to live and attend school that is such an environment where he is "encouraged and empowered," and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248558194530"><id gr:original-id="http://www.snakehsu.info/wordpress/?p=868">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/049cea0eb7a41cb6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">What is truly adaptive management?</title><published>2009-07-25T15:34:06Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T15:34:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/X7oyiVXZ31M/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.snakehsu.info/wordpress/?p=868"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Folke et al.

I come in for some disapprobation for criticizing Francis Collins’s appointment as head of the NIH and for making unwarranted  “theological arguments” in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to dissect this debate here but, damn him, P. Z. Myers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/numbers_and_nelson_dislocate_s.php"&gt;went and did it first&lt;/a&gt;.  I swear, the man is all over the blogosphere, no doubt aided by his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_gloves_are_off.php"&gt;horde&lt;/a&gt; of informants. I have little to add to what P.Z. said except to note that the argument from imperfection — i.e., organisms show imperfections of “design” that constitute evidence for evolution — is not a theological argument, but a scientific one.  The reason why the recurrent laryngeal nerve, for example, makes a big detour around the aorta before attaching to the larynx is perfectly understandable by evolution (the nerve and artery used to line up, but the artery evolved backwards, constraining the nerve to move with it), but &lt;em&gt;makes no sense under the idea of special creation&lt;/em&gt; — unless, that is, you believe that the creator designed things to make them look as if they evolved.  No form of creationism/intelligent design can explain these imperfections, but they all, as Dobzhansky said, “make sense in the light of evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers was pusillanimous and failed to engage Nelson as strongly as he should have.  I was ashamed of his performance, especially because I considered him one of us. And shame on Bloggingheads t.v. for putting on a young-earth creationist on &lt;em&gt;Science Saturday&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Numbers’ performance was a fine example of faitheism, and of the kind of non-threatening discourse that faitheists think we should all have with religion.  Watch it if you can, and then tell me if Numbers’ “civility” is certain to win more friends for evolution than, say, Richard Dawkins would have done in the same position.  I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

Garbage is thriving: &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/07/23/discovery-channel-plays-creation-museum-ad/"&gt;the Discovery Channel is running ads for the Creation "Museum"&lt;/a&gt;, and our very own scienceblogs is intermittently running an ad for creationist literature. There are a couple of things to know about this. One is that the economy sucks, and the media, in particular are struggling. Science media especially are suffering, so everyone is scrambling to scrape up whatever revenues they can. The other thing to notice is that in a down economy, faith-based lies and wishful thinking are cheap to produce and continue to sell, so that's what's happening. There isn't much we can do other than to grab every penny we can from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here's something I'd like you all to do. Go to that &lt;a href="http://www.gnmagazine.org/evolution/"&gt;obnoxious creationist ad that keeps appearing here&lt;/a&gt;, and take them up on their offer of a FREE booklet. Order it, I did, and it really is free — they don&amp;#39;t ask for a credit card number, there are no hidden shipping fees, but they probably will stick your name and address on a mailing list of the gullible (don&amp;#39;t worry, though, you aren&amp;#39;t, so you are contaminating their list). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says it takes two to four weeks to ship. As soon as I get mine, I&amp;#39;ll open up a thread here with the same title as the book, and we shall all join in a gleeful public evisceration of their crappy little booklet. If you&amp;#39;ve got a blog, put a critical dissection of the book there and send me the link, and I&amp;#39;ll add it to the post. We&amp;#39;ll give them publicity, all right, but it will be the harshest, nastiest, meanest publicity possible — we will do everything we can to make sure that when someone googles their organization or their booklet, all that comes back is a mountain of snarling contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll be fun.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on, some of you are getting this &lt;i&gt;completely wrong&lt;/i&gt;. DO NOT HAVE THE BOOKLET SENT TO A FAKE ADDRESS. This is not a campaign to make creationists waste lots of money and generate lots of garbage in landfills—it is an exercise in &lt;i&gt;informed analysis&lt;/i&gt;. You are supposed to have the booklet sent to yourself, so you can read it, and you can critique it. We'll then have a &lt;i&gt;discussion&lt;/i&gt; about its failures. You won't be able to participate if you haven't read the silly thing, now will you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also do not have it sent to random people you don't like. They won't bother to criticize it here, either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/those_awful_ads.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/cWuoLoAlT_w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248553855751"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/numbers_and_nelson_dislocate_s.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1601747afc72658</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Numbers and Nelson dislocate shoulders with strenuous back-patting</title><published>2009-07-25T21:03:07Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T21:03:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/_WBjSqx4i5Y/numbers_and_nelson_dislocate_s.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/numbers_and_nelson_dislocate_s.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ron Numbers is a very smart fellow, a historian of science, who has done marvelous work on the history of creationism. Paul Nelson is a Discovery Institute Fellow, a young earth creationist (but an amazingly fuzzy one), and, unfortunately, very long-winded. Bloggingheads has brought &lt;a href="http://brainwaveweb.com/diavlogs/21107"&gt;Ronald Numbers and Paul Nelson&lt;/a&gt; together in a dialog. I can hardly believe I listened to the whole thing — I was working away at other stuff while it was playing in the background, so it wasn&amp;#39;t a total waste of time — but it was incredibly boring. Both parties were so determined to be nice to each other that they spent the whole time agreeing with each other, and never wrestled with their differences. It was an epic collision of titanic marshmallows; no one was bruised or dented, but afterwards, everyone involved was sticky and gooey. It just fills one with a desire to wash one&amp;#39;s hands and maybe take a shot of some good scotch to get back a little sharpness and bite. Conviviality is a fine thing in an appropriate social situation, but in a discussion of matters of substance, it can be a toxic sludge that obscures differences and impedes the achievement of any real understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few interesting comments managed to untangle themselves from the treacle. Numbers made the useful point that religion achieves compatibility with science when it recedes into the background and simply accepts whatever science discovers as what the gods have been doing. That's fine with me; he didn't come right out and say, though, that religion lacks any method to actually determine the truth of any statement about the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson brought up a hypothetical (a common tactic of his): if an intelligent designer created and planted the very first cell in the ocean a few billion years ago, could methodological naturalism determine that? His point was that &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it had actually happened — whether a deity conjured that cell into existence, or a passing alien spacecraft flushed its space toilets as it passed by — it would be undetectable to the tools of methodological naturalism, and therefore it is a flawed procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers had a couple of answers to that. One was to compare it to his field of history, in which everyone knows some information is always lost over time. That does not mean that history cannot work, but simply that we always acknowledge that we cannot possibly know everything. He also made the pragmatic argument that methodological naturalism has been eminently successful, and is a tool that allows even the most evangelical Christian to be a successful scientist, and that breaking that down is an expense we should be unwilling to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he failed to mention, though, is that Intelligent Design creationism does not fill the gap in our knowledge. They have no tools in place to detect a great cosmic space poof (or flush) that occurred 3 billion years ago, either. What is their way of knowing that succeeds where science fails? Where is their evidence? The failings of ID creationism were not brought up, however, perhaps because it would breach civility on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only point where they got spiritedly critical, but not with each other (they still agreed entirely with each other) was — and you knew it had to be this — was in damning those damned damnable atheists. A major problem here was that Jerry Coyne&amp;#39;s book, &lt;i&gt;Why Evolution Is True&lt;/i&gt;, was made the target, Paul Nelson glibly mischaracterized the book, and Numbers obligingly accepted his mangling. They spent a fair amount of time flogging a dead horse filled with straw, or some such unholy metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nelson claimed that Coyne's book is "soaked in theology", that it was one big theological argument from beginning to end, and compared it to a hypothetical (again!) situation in which aliens landed, asked us to explain evolution, and Coyne begins by telling them the Christian myth, and how it is all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read the book. Nelson was not describing any book I've read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His example was to talk about the argument from imperfections, the fact that many of the points Coyne made as evidence of evolution were from sub-optimal adaptations, or historical relics. Nelson has made this argument many times before; he says that it is an attempt to judge what a rational god would do, finding differences from our expectations, and then using those to argue against religion…a purely theological plan and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers chimed in to agree vigorously, pointing out that imperfections are no argument against creationism, because creationists believe in a flawed world as a consequence of the Fall. I know this. It is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument from biological imperfections is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; theological, no matter how vociferously Nelson asserts that it is, because no biologist is simply saying what he claims they are; the interesting part about imperfections like the recurrent laryngeal nerve or the spine of bipeds or mammalian testicles isn't simply that they seem clumsy and broken in a way no sensible god would tolerate, but that &lt;i&gt;evolution provides an explanation for why they are so&lt;/i&gt;. We can build a case that these structures are a product of historical antecedents, and have a &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; case for them as consequences of common descent. Nelson is misrepresenting the argument, and Numbers just went along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, talking about Coyne leads into some Dawkins-bashing. Coyne and Dawkins are going beyond the conventional boundaries of science, Numbers says, and he doesn't like theological conclusions being made from empirical work; evolutionary biology doesn't and can't tell us much of anything about god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;ve got a specific theological claim, such as that the earth is only 6,000 years old (or, in Nelson&amp;#39;s uselessly blurry version, is simply much younger than geology says), then science certainly can weigh in on a theological claim. It can say that that specific claim is wrong. We can whittle away at virtually every material claim that religions make, and reduce them to an empirical void — the Catholic Church, for instance, officially goes along with the scientific observations of evolution, and simply adds an untestable, immaterial claim on top of it, that there was some moment of &amp;quot;ensoulment&amp;quot; that corresponds to the literary metaphor of Adam and Eve. Science can&amp;#39;t disprove that, but what it means is that they are diminished to making pointless claims about invisible, unobservable entities being magically added invisibly and immaterially to people at a distant time and place that they cannot name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a frustrating discussion. If either of them had been having a dialog with Dawkins or Coyne, then this would have been an interesting tack to take, because then they would be arguing over differences, and maybe some reasonable arguments would have emerged (entirely from the Dawkins/Coyne camp, of course). As it is, the two simply dodged their own deep differences to find common, non-antagonistic cause in bashing positions neither understood that were not represented by anyone in their dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, Numbers says one thing that really made me roll my eyes: "One thing that is not welcome in the science and religion debates is people in the middle." It's so true. When you are debating over straightforward questions, like "evolution vs. creation" or "god vs. no god", the position in the middle is non-existent, and people who try to waffle about, refusing to answer the question, are definitely not welcome. They're only there to add noise and confusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/numbers_and_nelson_dislocate_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_WBjSqx4i5Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248553617746"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13906">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b8328442f5302c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">From Micro- to Macro-Evolution in Two Minutes</title><published>2009-07-25T20:00:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T20:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/25/from-micro-to-macro-evolution-in-two-minutes/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few million years of evolution shown in two minutes of animation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re talking about a Heisman-trophy-winning quarterback.  The big man on campus.  The guy whose pajamas Superman wears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, apparently, the guy whose belief in Jesus is keeping him from enjoying the company of the thousands of nubile young women who seem to be &lt;a href="http://www.thebuckingbronco.com/2009/07/10/i-cant-stand-tim-tebow-man-has-good-taste-women"&gt;throwing themselves at him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of this, I tend to look at most of my decisions, good and bad alike, as integral to who I am and where my life has taken me.  If I had the ability to take something back, I can only think of one thing that I would consider.  It was a small, stupid thing, many years ago, done out of impulse, that hurt someone I cared about.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about you?  Do you view your decisions through a similar lens?  Do you have any regrets? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is really only the first of four that are coming out over the next half year or so that focus on the critical importance of science communication–and of figuring out ways of doing it very &lt;em&gt;differently&lt;/em&gt; and much more &lt;em&gt;effectively&lt;/em&gt; than has been done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this may be the start of a wave. And it’s likely to be a productive wave, as all of the books are different and thus, in a sense, complementary. Here are two of the others, along with Amazon links as I encourage you to pre-order&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597265632?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=159726563"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/07/dont-be-such-a-scientist.jpg" align="left" height="240" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Randy Olson, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597265632?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=159726563"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t Be Such A Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The celebrated scientist-turned-filmmaker explains how scientists can “stay true to the facts while tapping into something more primordial, more irrational, and ultimately more human.” Pub date Sept 7, Island Press, book website &lt;a href="http://www.dontbesuchascientist.com/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll have much more to say about this one soon–but clearly, it brings the valuable Hollywood and entertainment perspective to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674036352?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674036352"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2009/07/dean-cover.jpg" align="right" height="240" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cornelia Dean, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674036352?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674036352"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I Making Myself Clear? A Scientists’ Guide to Talking to the Public&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;science writer and editor argues that “to convey the facts…scientists must take a more active role in making their work accessible to the media, and thus to the public.” Pub date Oct 15, Harvard University Press. It sounds like Dean’s book will provide much more of a “how to” guide for scientists on speaking with the media–something that we didn’t really include in our book, although I have taught on this and will do so again (with Sheril) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography this August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, Dean’s sounds like another important read–and don’t you get the sense that there’s a trend here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth book….well, I can’t find any info online about it easily, so I will avoid mentioning for now. But I know it’s out there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum: Quite a lot of people are thinking about science communication, quite a lot of people are writing about it, quite a lot of people are realizing that there’s something about the way it has been done in the past that isn’t satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it too optimistic to hope that the ultimate impact of all of these books, together, will be a new awareness within the science world of just how important it is to actively and strategically &lt;em&gt;communicate about&lt;/em&gt; research, rather than merely publishing it and hoping the message gets out somehow?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248547026643"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-3682379174557268778">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc01ad2e58b63f0a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="islam" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="christianity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Let's play "Guess the Intolerant Religion!"</title><published>2009-07-25T18:23:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T18:23:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/lets-play-guess-intolerant-religion.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Absolutely terrible story &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8168480.stm"&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; right now... an 8-year-old girl in Arizona, the daughter of Liberian immigrants, was lured into a shed by a group of boys aged 9 to 14 and repeatedly raped.  As if that weren't bad enough, her family decided that the girl had "shamed" them, and basically refused to do anything to take care of her in the aftermath of the rape, leading the girl being taken into custody by CPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that the reason they feel like a rape &lt;i&gt;victim&lt;/i&gt; brings shame in the family probably has to do with religion.  I mean, I've never heard of secular humanist saying, "Since I abhor dogma and hold reason in the highest regard, I'm'a go honor-kill mah daughter!"  However, none of the news reports say anything about the parents' religion, though, so I'm not sure which sickening delusion I should be criticizing today.  What a quandary!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Liberia"&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, Liberia has a plurality of Christians (40%), so playing the odds that would be most likely.  They do have a non-trivial Muslim population (20%), and I gotta say, this type of shenanigans has the earmark of being inspired by the Religion of Peace... but who knows, it could just as easily be Christianity, or even an indigenous Liberian belief system (20%).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now accepting bets!&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3682379174557268778?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248545908853"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1506">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e952971ee560aa1d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="Perth"/><category term="skeptic"/><category term="student"/><category term="UWA"/><category term="Western Australia"/><title type="html">Back To Work!

Attention and memory systems are hijacked, turned to focus on attractive rivals. That's according to &lt;a href="http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/maner.dp.html"&gt;Jon Maner&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues who say theirs is one of the first studies to look at how romantic jealousy alters low-level cognitive functioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maner's team conducted four studies with hundreds of heterosexual student participants. All began and ended in a similar way. Infidelity concerns were triggered in half the participants by asking them to write about four or five incidents in which they'd felt romantically jealous. The remaining participants acted as controls and wrote about an anxiety-provoking scenario that had nothing to do with infidelity. Meanwhile, all the studies ended with a test of chronic jealousy. Participants were categorised as jealous according to how jealous they said they would feel in a range of ambiguous scenarios - for example, seeing their partner smile to someone of the opposite sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the key findings. The first study required participants to shift their attention away from pictures of faces to make judgements about shapes located in a different part of the computer screen. Prompting concerns about infidelity caused jealous participants to find it difficult to drag their attention away from photos of attractive people of the same sex as themselves. It was as if their minds had become focused on romantic threats. Their attention to average looking people, by contrast, was unaffected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second study involved a card game a bit like "pairs" or "concentration" and showed that infidelity concerns prompted jealous participants to have superior memory specifically for attractive faces of people of the same sex as themselves - again, suggesting that their minds were suddenly wired up to detect romantic threats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final two studies showed that writing about infidelity caused jealous participants to suddenly develop subconscious negative attitudes towards attractive people of the same sex. For example, they were quicker to respond when attractive faces and negative words were associated with the same response key. This is the opposite to the usual finding that attractive people are viewed more positively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The current work provides a rich picture of the cognitive processes that may be involved in protecting relationships from potential romantic rivals," the researchers said. "Priming the threat of infidelity promoted intrasexual vigilance - a functionally organised cascade of lower-order cognitive processes aimed at preferentially processing highly attractive, and therefore highly threatening, members of one's own sex."&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Personality+and+Social+Psychology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Intrasexual+vigilance%3A+The+implicit+cognition+of+romantic+rivalry&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=97&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=74&amp;amp;rft.epage=87&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F19586241&amp;amp;rft.au=Jon+Maner&amp;amp;rft.au=Saul+Miller&amp;amp;rft.au=Aaron+Rouby&amp;amp;rft.au=Matthew+Gailliot&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology"&gt;Jon Maner, Saul Miller, Aaron Rouby, &amp;amp; Matthew Gailliot (2009).

&lt;p&gt;Albinos are getting killed and mutilated for their body parts.  Witch doctors believe their organs “bring good luck in love, life and business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man in the video explains how his brother Daniel was murdered by another family member — Daniel’s arms and legs were chopped off.  The body parts were later sold for $240.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what can happen when poverty and hopelessness meet superstition and miseducation.&lt;/p&gt;

It's only natural and proper that some things get of lot of attention if they seem to be scientifically important. But Thomas Pfeiffer and Robert Hoffmann warn in a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;PLoS One&lt;/span&gt; paper that popularity can lead to inaccuracy - &lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/Large-Scale%20Assessment%20of%20the%20Effect%20of%20Popularity%20on%20the%20Reliability%20of%20Research"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=PLoS+ONE&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Large-Scale+Assessment+of+the+Effect+of+Popularity+on+the+Reliability+of+Research&amp;amp;rft.issn=1932-6203&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=4&amp;amp;rft.issue=6&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.plos.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996&amp;amp;rft.au=Pfeiffer%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hoffmann%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CSocial+Science%2CResearch+%2F+Scholarship"&gt;Large-Scale Assessment of the Effect of Popularity on the Reliability of Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They note two reasons for this. Firstly, popular topics tend to attract interest and money. This means  that scientists have much to gain by publishing "positive results" as this allows them to get in on the action -&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify;font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In highly competitive fields there might be stronger incentives to “manufacture” positive results by, for example, modifying data or statistical tests until formal statistical significance is obtained. This leads to inflated error rates for individual findings... We refer to this mechanism as “inflated error effect”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Secondly, in fields where there is a lot of research being done, the chance that someone will, just by chance, come up with a positive finding increases -&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic"&gt;The second effect results from multiple independent testing of the same hypotheses by competing research groups. The more often a hypothesis is tested, the more likely a positive result is obtained and published even if the hypothesis is false. ... We refer to this mechanism as “multiple testing effect”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;But does this happen in real life? The authors say yes, based on a review of research into protein-protein interactions in yeast. (Happily, you don't need to be a yeast expert to follow the argument.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two ways of trying to find out whether two proteins interact with each other inside cells. You could do a small-scale experiment specifically looking for one particular interaction: say, Protein B with Protein X. Or you can do "high-throughput" screening of lots of proteins to see which ones interact: Does Protein A interact with B, C, D, E... Does Protein B interact with A, C, D, E... etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been tens of thousands of small-scale experiments into yeast proteins, and more recently, a few high-throughput studies. The authors looked at the small-scale studies and found that the more popular a certain protein was, the less likely it was that reported interactions involving it would be confirmed by high-throughput experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SmrvWpdh6LI/AAAAAAAAAck/KEkZCcj_dzo/s1600-h/popularity+science.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:136px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SmrvWpdh6LI/AAAAAAAAAck/KEkZCcj_dzo/s400/popularity+science.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The second and the third of the above graphs shows the effect. Increasing popularity leads to a falling % of confirmed results. The first graph shows that interactions which were &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;replicated &lt;/span&gt;by lots of small-scale experiments tended to be confirmed, which is what you'd expect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfeiffer and Hoffmann note that high-throughput studies have issues of their own, so using them as a yardstick to judge the truth of other results is a little problematic. However, they say that the overall trend remains valid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an interesting paper which provides some welcome empirical support to the theoretical argument that popularity could lead to unreliability. Unfortunately, the problem is by no means confined to yeast. Any area of science in which researchers engage in a search for publishable "positive results" is vulnerable to the dangers of publication bias, data cherry-picking, and so forth. Even obscure topics are vulnerable but when researchers are falling over themselves to jump on the latest scientific bandwagon, the problems multiply exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A recent example may be the "depression gene", &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5HTTLPR"&gt;5HTTLPR&lt;/a&gt;. Since a landmark paper in 2003 linked it to clinical depression, there has been an explosion of research into this genetic variant. Literally hundreds of papers appeared - it is by far the most studied gene in psychiatric genetics. But a lot of this research came from scientists with little experience or interest in genes. It's  easy and cheap to collect a DNA sample and genotype it. People started routinely looking at 5HTTLPR whenever they did any research on depression - or anything related.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wait - a recent meta-analysis reported that &lt;a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/06/myth-of-depression-gene.html"&gt;the gene is not in fact linked to depression at all&lt;/a&gt;. If that's true (it could well be), how did so many hundreds of papers appear which did find an effect?&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Pfeiffer and Hoffmann's paper provides a convincing explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Link &lt;/span&gt;- Orac also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/popularity_versus_reliability_in_medical.php"&gt;blogged this paper&lt;/a&gt; and put a characteristic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_and_alternative_medicine"&gt;CAM&lt;/a&gt; angle on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=PLoS+ONE&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Large-Scale+Assessment+of+the+Effect+of+Popularity+on+the+Reliability+of+Research&amp;amp;rft.issn=1932-6203&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=4&amp;amp;rft.issue=6&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.plos.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005996&amp;amp;rft.au=Pfeiffer%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hoffmann%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CSocial+Science%2CResearch+%2F+Scholarship"&gt;Pfeiffer, T., &amp;amp; Hoffmann, R.

I'm not going to reprint my response to that part, because, well, his criticisms were pretty much a boilerplate of other blowback I've received from the post. What caught my attention more was that he noticed a couple of posts of mine about Jenny McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll paraphrase, because I don't have this person's permission to post his e-mail. Not that that would necessarily stop me, as my e-mail policy clearly says that I retain the right to post any blog-related e-mail solely at my discretion. However, in this particular case I thought that would be totally uncool; I usually only invoke that policy for abusive or insulting e-mails. In any case, specifically he was unhappy over the "harshness" of my tone, pointing out that she was a mother of an autistic child, motivated by good intentions, and all the usual defenses I hear. He said that, even though he agrees with me my nastiness made him unlikely to want to read any further. As I responded, my e-mail got longer and longer, to the point where I thought: Why waste this? This is good stuff, man. It should go on the blog. I'm also really busy working on a grant this weekend; so wasting all that brilliance on one person seemed....well, wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to post an edited version of my response that leaves out my defense of my post about Bill Maher and addresses only the Jenny McCarthy issue. I do this mainly because the Bill Maher part might reveal more than I want to about who wrote to me:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/reader_e-mail_why_are_you_picking_on_jen.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/reader_e-mail_why_are_you_picking_on_jen.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/hkJVSc916qo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248537628586"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/atheist_fundamentalists.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e5a69cd5e9662c19</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">“Atheist Fundamentalists”</title><published>2009-07-25T15:52:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T15:52:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/_4gHnunppxI/atheist_fundamentalists.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/atheist_fundamentalists.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Number one on my list of dead-giveaways that I'm dealing with a moron of the first order: when they start whining about "atheist fundamentalists", comparing a Richard Dawkins to a Pat Robertson, or babbling about how those atheists are just as fanatical and wicked as the fundagelical zealots. When people start in on that line of unreason, all they're doing is trying to tar atheists with the taint of the wretched works of the Taliban or the American theocrats, without actually addressing any comparisons of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one writer at &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/07/the_silliest_smear.cfm"&gt;The Economist recognizes the absurdity of the false equivalence&lt;/a&gt;. The article would be very good &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it hadn't fallen for number two on my list of peeves: the old "Hitler was an atheist" canard. No, he wasn't. He was Catholic, leading a largely Catholic country. Not only can't you blame atheism for the Nazis, but even if he had been an atheist, it would be as ridiculous to fault atheism for his crimes as it would be to accuse Catholicism of being an explicitly genocidal cult bent on world domination by military conquest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer does have a few criticisms of atheists: he says we can be smug and annoying. That's a fair cop. When you're an advocate for what is right among the milling herd of gullible, superstitious jebus-worshippers, though, I think a little smugness is warranted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/atheist_fundamentalists.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_4gHnunppxI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248535663069"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_oh_captain_m.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a53592a6d3da1b50</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Stuff"/><title type="html">Weekend Diversion: Oh Captain, My Captain!</title><published>2009-07-25T14:55:31Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T14:55:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_oh_captain_m.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is so much good music out there that never, ever hits the mainstream.  But if you dig a little bit, you can not only find some good ones, occasionally you hit the gold mine.  Such is the case with &lt;a href="http://www.thebridgemusic.com/"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, a Baltimore-based band that I'll almost definitely come see September 5th when they come through Portland.  Take a listen to one of my favorite jams of theirs, &lt;a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/the-bridge/self-titled"&gt;Jeremiah Jones&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_oh_captain_m/07%2520Jeremiah%2520Jones%25201.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what's something I've never posted as a Weekend Diversion before, somehow?  A poem.  So, I present to you &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ocaptain.jpg"&gt;O Captain!  My Captain!&lt;/a&gt; by Walt Whitman, a beautifully sad one written just after the death of Abraham Lincoln.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;&lt;br&gt;
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;&lt;br&gt;	 
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,&lt;br&gt;
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:&lt;br&gt; 
    But O heart! heart! heart!&lt;br&gt;
      O the bleeding drops of red,&lt;br&gt;	 
        Where on the deck my Captain lies,&lt;br&gt;	 
          Fallen cold and dead.&lt;br&gt;	 
&lt;br&gt;
O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;&lt;br&gt;	 
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;&lt;br&gt;
For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;&lt;br&gt;	 
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;&lt;br&gt;	 
    Here Captain! dear father!&lt;br&gt;	 
      This arm beneath your head;&lt;br&gt;	 
        It is some dream that on the deck,&lt;br&gt;
          You&amp;#39;ve fallen cold and dead.&lt;br&gt;	 
&lt;br&gt;
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;&lt;br&gt;	 
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;&lt;br&gt;	 
The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;&lt;br&gt;	 
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;&lt;br&gt;
    Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!&lt;br&gt;	 
      But I, with mournful tread,&lt;br&gt;	 
        Walk the deck my Captain lies,&lt;br&gt;	 
          Fallen cold and dead.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It's a poem that almost everyone has heard of, but that hardly anyone I know has read.  It's also one of the most straight-as-an-arrow things about me: that I think Abraham Lincoln was simply a magnificent human being.  I hope this oft-forgotten poem touches you a little bit the way it does me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_oh_captain_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248534347284"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1600">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4c3ee1bfc24d014</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the law"/><title type="html">Law as applied linguistics</title><published>2009-07-25T14:28:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T14:28:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1600" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Barbara Phillips Long pointed me to Prof. James Maule's  tax-law blog, &lt;a href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/"&gt;Mauled Again&lt;/a&gt;, because, she wrote, &amp;quot;he touches on three areas that intrigue me –language, teaching and economics&amp;quot;. So I followed the link and read a few pages, and I was struck by a number of implicit connections. For example, his approach to teaching the tax code reminded me of the way I was taught, many years ago, to &amp;quot;construe&amp;quot; Latin texts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I take the students through an analysis of how Code sections and Treasury regulation sections are constructed, showing them that the secret to parsing the language is … to break the conglomeration of words into phrases and other segments and then to re-connect them, preferably in a manner that resembles English more than what I call &amp;quot;tax-ese.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Prof. Maule goes into the process in considerable additional detail, and it really does seem to be closely analogous to the traditional pedagogical technique described in the OED's sense 3 of &lt;em&gt;construe:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To analyse or trace the grammatical construction of a sentence; to take its words in such an order as to show the meaning of the sentence; spec. to do this in the study of a foreign and especially a classical language, adding a word for word translation; hence, loosely, to translate orally a passage in an ancient or foreign author.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach long ago fell out of fashion as a way to teach foreign languages, for mostly good reasons.  But it also gave students a model for understanding complex material in their native language by an analogous process of analysis and re-synthesis. And a more sophisticated version of the same process remains at the heart of everyday linguistic analysis, where the goal is not simply to understand what a sentence means, but also how and why it means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Maule's pedagogical notes are full of other implicit law/linguistics connections. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Finally, I try to instill in the students’ minds the difference between what they think they are going to be doing and what they often will need to do. They are accustomed to working from premises (or facts) to conclusions. Though there is opportunity enough in tax, and in other courses, to engage in this consequential analysis, there also is a need to understand the process of working from a desired conclusion to the premises or facts. As an example of how students enhance my teaching, I did not articulate this aspect of the course in this manner until a student, who had come to my office several times to complain that something was wrong with my teaching and grading because she was a top student but was doing poorly in my tax course, returned to exclaim, "I figured out what you are doing. We spent a year being given A and B, with the objective of getting to C, and you’re telling us we have A and want to get to C and are asking us what we need to get there." Bingo.  That’s the essence of transactional work, of tax planning and of planning in many other areas of law. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being given A, having the objective of getting to C, and trying to figure out "what we need to get there", is an excellent ordinary-language account of the theory of meaning advanced in e.g. Hobbs, Stickel, Martin and Edwards, "&lt;a href="http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/P/P88/P88-1012.pdf"&gt;Interpretation as Abduction&lt;/a&gt;", ACL 26, 1988, which argues that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… the interpretation of a sentence is the least-cost abductive proof of the logical form of the sentence. That is, to interpret a sentence one tries to prove the logical form by using the most salient axioms and other information, exploiting the natural redundancy of discourse to minimize the size of the proof, and allowing the minimal number of consistent and plausible assumptions necessary to make the proof go through. Anaphora are resolved and predications are pragmatically strengthened as a by-product of this process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005391.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002927.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some further discussion.)&lt;/p&gt;

These are generally professionally-done ‘casts made by people with long experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they had to start somewhere, right? At some point in the past, these folks were just people who had something to say and wanted their voices heard. So if you’re like that too — opinionated, willing to back up your claims, and dying to get the message out — but lack a platform, what can you do? Starting your own podcast can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds fmailiar, then you should check out &lt;a href="http://skeptographers.com"&gt;Skeptographers&lt;/a&gt;. This is a community-driven podcast where anyone can upload content and have it aired. Of course, there are some caveats; they can’t simply take anything submitted, but there are guidelines on how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is an interesting idea. The whole point of the internet is that it’s egalitarian; people who have quality content can flourish, and if you suck, people won’t listen. Well, usually. But that’s the idea, anyway. A podcast like this can get people who otherwise don’t have much of a voice online a chance to be heard. And if they’re good, then they may break out and be followed. It’s not without precedent; &lt;a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/"&gt;365 Days of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; has a similar basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So head over to Skeptographers, give it a listen (&lt;a href="http://skeptographers.com/episodes/pilot"&gt;the pilot episode is already online&lt;/a&gt;) and if you have something to say, then &lt;em&gt;say it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248533964052"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=591">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d009bbfdee8fa44f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Society of Homeopaths apply to join Health Professions Council</title><published>2009-07-25T13:32:17Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T13:32:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/society-of-homeopaths-apply-to-join-health-professions-council/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The Society of Homeopaths (SoH) are applying for membership of the Health Professions Council (HPC).

Babson before, but maybe some of you at east coast colleges have seen one of his monuments. He was an eccentric millionaire who &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Antigravity-of-the/47082/"&gt;founded the Gravity Research Foundation and donated money for anti-gravity research&lt;/a&gt;. He gave money to colleges that would accept one of his granite monuments to "remind students of the blessings forthcoming when science determines what gravity is, how it works, and how it may be controlled." It was his obsession. Apparently, his concern traces back to one event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babson, born in 1875, was a self-made millionaire who founded three colleges and once ran for the U.S. presidency as the candidate of the Prohibition Party. He became obsessed with gravity at the age of 18 when his younger sister, Edith, drowned in Massachusetts' Annisquam River.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"She was unable to fight gravity," Babson later wrote, "which came up and seized her like a dragon and brought her to the bottom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Tennessee state senator Paul Stanley. He's a solid conservative Republican and married father of two, who according to &lt;a href="http://www.paulstanley.org/about.htm"&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt; is "a member of Christ United Methodist Church, where he serves as a Sunday school teacher and board member of their day school." (Check out the religious imagery on the site -- the sun poking through clouds, as if manifesting God's presence -- which of course shows Stanley's deeply pious nature.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and most salient, as Oxford’s Tim Garton Ash writes, “there are no al-Darwinia brigades making bombs in secret laboratories in north Oxford.” Yes, sigh, many atheists like Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennet are just as convinced that there is no God as Osama bin Laden is convinced that there is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger. On one hand you have faith that makes people fly planes into buildings, genitally mutilate young girls, murder abortion doctors (in church), stone adultresses, outlaw certain forms of consensual sex or even just make it impossible to buy beer on Sunday in some states. On the other hand there is the atheist “faith” that makes people write smug op-eds, put ads on buses (see photo), file frivolous lawsuits against nativity scenes on public property, and the like. Show me what harm in the world a prominent atheist intellectual has done. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’re thinking of Stalin and Mao here, read the essay first.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atheists can be smug and annoying. So can Christians and Jews, Yankee fans and Red Sox fans. The claims of religious writers and atheist writers should be debated on their merits. But let’s can the “fundamentalist atheist” meme. The fundamentalist mindset is defined as one that cannot be changed by evidence. As Sam Harris, another atheist, has said, God could easily prove all the world’s atheists wrong. (Mr Harris’s &lt;a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Secular-Philosophies/Is-Religion-Built-Upon-Lies.aspx?p=4"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;: “I have just written a 30-digit number on a scrap of paper and hidden it in my office. If God tells you [or any of our readers] what this number is, I will be appropriately astounded and will publicize the results of this experiment to the limit of my abilities… Hint to the Creator: I’m thinking of an even number, and it’s not 927459757074561008328610835528″.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on this, see &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/may/03/cananatheistbeafundamenta"&gt;Anthony Grayling’s nice piece&lt;/a&gt;, “Can an atheist be a fundamentalist?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How can I know whether a certain religious group is Christian or if it’s a cult?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we all know it’s either one or the other…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Graham’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Cults often claim that they, and they alone, have the truth about God, and they often dismiss other churches as wrong or misguided. They also may claim that God gave their founder a new revelation that “corrects” the “errors” of others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone please explain to me why this is not incredible irony.&lt;/p&gt;

L. Mencken&lt;/a&gt; defined Puritanism as &lt;em&gt;"The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I once heard &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker"&gt; Paul Volcker &lt;/a&gt;say the same of central bankers.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This wonderful quote came to mind when I was chatting recently with a friend who has become editor of a leading magazine, with both a news-stand and a web presence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friend was quite relaxed about bloggers and fansites copying and pasting material from the magazine's main website, as long as it was properly attributed. It increased awareness and it promoted the magazine's credibility; it was, in effect, free and finely-targeted advertising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the publishing house's lawyers hated it. The material is copyright and, gasp, it was being used without authorisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their haunting fear was that someone, somewhere, may be using intellectual property without a licence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sympathised, for I know that mindset well. And, for me, it raises a fundamental problem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is the place of copyright of content in the &lt;em&gt;copy-and-paste&lt;/em&gt; generation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sheer ease with which one can now copy, download, and store any digital information undermines the traditional approaches to copyright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, for the conventional intellectual property lawyer, such ease does not compute; it must be stopped; threatening (yawn) letters must be sent; ISPs threatened, damages (and of course costs) demanded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I think there is a more sensible view. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The circulation of content for non-commercial use can be seen as the digital equivalent of "word of mouth". It is a good thing, as long as the content is properly attributed, for it promotes the client's reputation and profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intellectual property law will always have an important role in dealing with unauthorised commercial exploitation of proprietary material, or when content is passed off as the work of another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may perhaps be loss of royalties; but there are huge gains to be offset against the advertising budget. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fundamental question is whether overall there may be more traffic to the originating website or more "real-world" purchases of publications, CDs, and even downloads. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That can be a difficult commercial decision for the copyright owner; but it is one which really should not distorted by the artificial effect of zealous and anxious copyright lawyers.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-9040690352107440668?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248509451070"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/there_goes_yet_another_autism_myth">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7ba0faa26d3633ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">There Goes Yet Another Autism Myth</title><published>2009-07-25T07:37:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T07:37:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/there_goes_yet_another_autism_myth" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/images/2007/11/16/cds_15_152x203.jpg" alt="Pile of CD cases from http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/images/2007/11/16/cds_15_152x203.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are &lt;a href="http://www.wrongplanet.net/article361.html"&gt;so many&lt;/a&gt; autism &lt;a href="http://autism.about.com/od/whatisautism/tp/topmyths.htm"&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ColdandFluNews/story?id=6089162&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;floating&lt;/a&gt; around out there that debunking them often seems a constant aspect of advocating about autism. (And look out, too, for those &lt;a href="http://www.blogher.com/identifying-and-avoiding-autism-cults"&gt;autism cults&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One myth that always rankles me is that autistic children don't change and that they can't; that a child will always be a two-year-old inside even when he is six feet tall. It is the case that it's often not easy for my son to deal with a new situation or a change in circumstances. This leads to some occasionally interesting moments when the inevitable new situation or change occurs (his favorite &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diner_date"&gt;diner&lt;/a&gt; is closed for renovations; there's a different bus driver or new aide; he's tall enough to reach the top shelf of the cabinet). While Charlie often expresses maximum hesitancy to plunge into the new, he is not entirely resistant to change, not at all. What's tricky to ascertain is what Jim calls "the lag," the time between when Charlie realizes there's a change or something new going on, and when he assents to it and accepts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For quite a long time, Charlie's maintained a collection of CD and DVD cases and some CDs and DVDs. "Some" because many of the CDs and DVDs have been discarded; most have been so smudged and scratched that they are not playable; more than a few were secreted away down a certain crack in the stairs. There were two Beatles albums along with some Barney ones, some Disney ones, a (truth be told) Teletubbies album cover, and a smattering of jazz and blues and the Byrds. Charlie would spread them all out or stack them into piles of indeterminable organization and look at them absorbedly; at moments of extreme agitation, everything went flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the most recent instance of the latter, I gathered everything up and put them into a big white trash bag. I heard the voice of some consultant whispering in my ear about the "inappropriateness" of Charlie "stimming" on all those things and how letting him do it would be (was clearly) an antecedent for "behaviors" and what was wrong with us, kiddie stuff should have gone o-u-t a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I remembered how years ago, when everytime we turned on a Barney video Charlie asked for, he smiled and went to watch it and headbanged, we put all the Barney videos and a stuffed Barney himself into a plastic trash bag and threw them away. In those days Charlie equated something going into the garbage as being gone, gone forever, and, with many tears, that was the end of it. But ever since, we've felt that wasn't the best way to proceed with these stims/obsessions/absorptions. Obviously Barney (and the CDs and DVDs) meant something to Charlie and how would we feel to see our parents toss things away all while saying "I am doing this because it is good for you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left the big white trash bag of CD and DVD cases and CDs and DVDs sitting in Charlie's room. For a couple of weeks he left it there, only dumping out everything last weekend. Wednesday afternoon, his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_the_community"&gt;babysitter&lt;/a&gt; came and while she and I chatted, Charlie went to his room. I heard a few random noises but nothing untoward, and then looked up and saw Charlie with the big white trash bag, fully loaded. "Garbage," he said to me and held out the bag for me to tie up. After I did so, he carried out and, while the babysitter and I watched, put it into the garbage, smiled a bit, and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change happens. Parents (like this one) often want it to happen faster and when we feel, or are told, it's time. But there's more than something to be said for letting the person in whom you'd like to see the change---one's child---undertake that change himself, when he knows he is ready. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248505697772"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/observationsofanerd/~3/ArW1CswgJoY/live-mice-from-stem-cells.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f3446030287cd062</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Live mice from stem cells!</title><published>2009-07-24T19:45:01Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T19:45:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/pj9AmvO6J3U/live-mice-from-stem-cells.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/observationsofanerd/~3/ArW1CswgJoY/live-mice-from-stem-cells.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_tiny.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;News today has spread about new stem cell research out of China. Two teams used mouse fibroblasts, a kind of cell found in skin connective tissues, to create induced pluripotent skin cells (iPS), which were then used to create living mice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/SmpGGKk1pQI/AAAAAAAAAaI/CEW1s1lPPwk/s1600-h/mouse_in_petri_dish.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/SmpGGKk1pQI/AAAAAAAAAaI/CEW1s1lPPwk/s320/mouse_in_petri_dish.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Their breakthrough research suggests that both cloning full animals from stem cells and the creation of completely pluripotent stem cells from skin cells are both not only possible, but a current reality. The two teams published separately, in &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/abs/nature08267.html"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B8G3V-4WV0B98-1&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_coverDate=07%2F23%2F2009&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=browse&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=d3d10b1ba7ce9f22ee9290834fc10ae3"&gt;Cell - Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;, both very prestigious journals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first task for either study was to create stem cells from non stem cells. Embryonic stem cells, controversial because they often come from the destruction of live embryos, are what is called "pluripotent," which means they can become any cell in the body. To be able to create cells that act like embryonic stem cells, without the embryo part, opens to door to a fascinating and less-controversial field of medical research, including organ repair or even full organ replacements that are guaranteed to match the host's body. Just imagine never having to look for donors for bone marrow or a heart, and you can get the idea of how amazing this research could be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These teams are not the first to have created such cells - other studies have created stem cells from a variety of other cells, though some work better than others, and exactly how pluripotent they are is still up for debate. This team created stem cells, called iPS cells, from fibroblasts, the most common cell in connective tissue, from late stage embryos by using a viral vector to introduce genes which allowed the cells to "reprogram" into any cell type. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/SmpFgvDEv8I/AAAAAAAAAaA/2HIP6n98imo/s1600-h/Picture+3.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:320px;height:279px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/SmpFgvDEv8I/AAAAAAAAAaA/2HIP6n98imo/s320/Picture+3.png" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To prove that these iPS cells really could become anything, they tested them over and over again, including looking at whether they had the same cell surface markers as embryonic stem cells. They used fluorescent staining to show that the created cells did, indeed, have the same markers as embryonic stem cells (Left).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both groups decided that the truest test of their iPS cells, however, was to attach them to a sham embryo called a tetraploid embryo, which can create a placenta but no actual animal. The only way a mouse would form from the union was if the iPS cells were able to divide and differentiate into the necessary tissues to become a living animal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first group, published in Nature, included a dominant black coat color allele into their stem cells, then placed the embryos into white mice, giving them an initial visual check. If the young were black, they had to have come from the stem cells. When the first black baby mouse was born, further DNA tests confirmed that Tiny (as he was named) had indeed arisen from the iPS line. It took them over 250 developing embryos before they achieved a live mouse. Out of the 37 stem cell lines created, 3 produced live mice, and out of a total of 624 injected embryos from the best cell line, they got only 22 live births. That's a success rate of only 3.5%. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/SmpEt5qwnYI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/mrtSQwVH3No/s1600-h/Picture+2.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:211px;height:162px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/SmpEt5qwnYI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/mrtSQwVH3No/s400/Picture+2.png" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Even these mice, though born live, were not all perfect. Some were chimeric, having somehow taken genetic material from both the iPS cells and the host mom or tetraploid embryo. Even those that were fully iPS generated had flaws. Some died just days later, and many were deformed or physically abnormal. 12, however, were able to pass a reproductive biologists strict test of health: they were fertile, producing hundreds of second and third generation mice (like the one on the right). Even still, there is a lot that isn't known about these stem-cell derived mice, like whether their children develop diseases more readily than normal mice, or are as healthy in general. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other group, who published in Cell, followed the same basic procedure. They were able to create 187 tetraploid embryos and implant them in receptive female mice. Of those, however, they only had 2 live births (1.1%), one of which died in infancy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both teams are now looking deeper into the differences between iPS and embryonic stem cells to understand what causes the high mortality, abnormality and failure rates of these embryos. It also remains a mystery as to whether adult fibroblasts can become iPS cells which have the same pluripotent abilities, as both teams used the skin cells from late stage embryos to create their stem cell lines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If adult cells work, too, it would mean that we might be able to clone adult mammals using their skin. The authors vehemently deny any connection or plans of utilizing this research for human cloning - and at a rate of 1.1%-3.5% just to produce a live birth, let alone further complications, I agree with them. There's still far too much uncertainty to even think of applying this method to humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the fact that these stem cells were able to be pluripotent, even 1.1% of the time, gives a lot of hope to future medical research. Indeed, we might just be able to create tissues or organs on demand from a patient's own cells in the next 50 years, which would save the lives of many suffering from a variety of diseases. More interestingly, however, is that these cloned animals may lead to a better understanding of how cells develop, divide, and fail, leading to breakthroughs in prevention and treatments of conditions like cancer instead of just patches to prolong life after the disease has set in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Nature&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1038%2Fnature08267&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=iPS+cells+produce+viable+mice+through+tetraploid+complementation+&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fvnfv%2Fncurrent%2Fpdf%2Fnature08267.pdf&amp;amp;rft.au=Lan+Kang&amp;amp;rft.au=Jianle+Wang&amp;amp;rft.au=Yu+Zhang&amp;amp;rft.au=Zhaohui+Kou&amp;amp;rft.au=Shaorong+Ga&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology"&gt;Lan Kang, Jianle Wang, Yu Zhang, Zhaohui Kou, &amp;amp; Shaorong Ga (2009). iPS cells produce viable mice through tetraploid complementation  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt; DOI: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08267"&gt;10.1038/nature08267&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Cell+Stem+Cell&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.stem.2009.07.001&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=iPS+Cells+Can+Support+Full-Term+Development+of+Tetraploid+Blastocyst-Complemented+Embryos&amp;amp;rft.issn=19345909&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS193459090900335X&amp;amp;rft.au=Kang%2C+L.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wang%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Zhang%2C+Y.&amp;amp;rft.au=Kou%2C+Z.&amp;amp;rft.au=Gao%2C+S.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology"&gt;Kang, L., Wang, J., Zhang, Y., Kou, Z., &amp;amp; Gao, S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .amassing a library of creation literature for her church, building a model of Noah’s ark, and teaching creationism to elementary schoolers. She called her project Alternate Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now according to the Girl Scouts of America, this was not an endorsement of creationism but rather the award honors personal fulfillment and community involvement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…something that a girl can be passionate about—in thought, deed, and action. The project is something that fulfills a need within a girl’s community (whether local or global), creates change, and hopefully, is something that becomes ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s interesting how this at least superficially seems to mirror a topic I was discussing yesterday, Bill Maher being given the Richard Dawkins Award for promoting atheism. I disagreed with the choice given Maher’s infamous status as someone who promotes quack medicine while condemning real medicine. But a lot of people argued that he’s strictly being honored for his efforts with atheism and that his other beliefs shouldn’t play a factor in the decision regardless of how “religulous” they are. In this instance, I don’t actually know how the Gold Award process works and if every girl who completes their project receives the same award. But if not and this is a special award that she was being singled out for achieving, I would have definitely thought twice about choosing a girl who promoted pseudoscience as her project to be the recipiant of the high honor, lest it appear to be a tacit endorsement of evolution denialism.&lt;/p&gt;

And even more specifically, books with the title “&lt;em&gt;Baby Be-bop&lt;/em&gt;,” about a gay teenager, which they claim is “explicitly vulgar, racial and anti-Christian”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ned’s going to a farm camp some three hours from here, right in what they call in my home state “the willywacks” because that’s the sound the branch makes when it snaps back on the deep forest trail and hits you on the cheek. I never did sleepaway camp but Jill did, and she’s estimating with fair accuracy, I think, the stages Ned will pass through: three days of rapture at the parent-free life, one or two days of crumbling feelings, three days of homesickness, then rapture again until he gets off the bus wanting to immediately return to sleepaway camp for the rest of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:460px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/star-wars-bed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/star-wars-bed.jpg" alt="Image: geekologie.com" width="450" height="397"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: geekologie.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing the stages Alex will pass through: two or three days of rapture at the competition for my parents’ attention-free life, two or three days of wonder, then a few days of sadness at having nobody to kick on the couch, then…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? Asking for Ned I imagine: “Ned? Want Ned!” I suspect Alex will say more and more. (And not like when he sometimes says “Ned!” as a synonym for “annoying!”) Ned? Want Ned? I don’t think he’ll panic after Ned doesn’t return for a week; I don’t think Alex will be having bedtime breakdowns because nobody’s in the room with him (Ned might if the situation were reversed). I think Alex will keep wondering and wondering despite the explanations and timetable we give him. “Ned will be home in nine days, Alex.” “Ned will be home in seven days, Alex…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want Ned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately how much and to what depth Alex misses Ned will be a secret of Alex — not so much one he won’t share, but one that he can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody’s going to miss me,” Ned has claimed. I know mommy will and I know I will, and I’m pretty sure Alex will, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Headlines read "&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE56L5YB20090722"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Chinese herbs show early promise for endometriosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" and  "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090707201114.htm"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Chinese Herbs May Relieve Endometriosis Symptoms, Review Finds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a medical condition in which some of the endometrial cells (typically found in the uterus under the fluctuating influence of female hormones) are found outside of the uterine cavity. Symptoms include many nonspecific complaints such as pelvic pain, infertility, nausea, unusual menstruation, chronic fatigue, mood swings, back pain, ovarian cysts, constipation, urinary tract infections, diarrhea, anemia, etc. Appropriate diagnosis is by laparoscopic biopsy - a doctor will use a laparoscopic instrument to remove suspected extrauterine endometrial cells and examine them.  Treatments vary and can include hormonal treatments or surgery to remove the cells. In China, treatment of this disorder with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is routine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Christina Stephens)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248497345251"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/07/still-enjoying-interviewprojec/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a53745db8c57d3e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">still enjoying interviewprojec…</title><published>2009-07-25T02:41:01Z</published><updated>2009-07-25T02:41:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/07/still-enjoying-interviewprojec/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;still enjoying interviewproject.davidlynch.com&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248497345250"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/07/watching-survivors-remake-go/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ac5d7dbb84ba1aa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">watching #Survivors remake, go…</title><published>2009-07-23T00:59:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T00:59:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/07/watching-survivors-remake-go/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;watching #Survivors remake, good old fashioned BBC drama made better&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248496592831"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/isiss_office_window_a_place_fo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d9166e808a2ad894</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Isis's Office Window.

Then I remembered once seeing someone do some stuff on Ustream and the wheels started turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I got to thinking about how I teach, and the effectiveness of my teaching, and more about Ustream and I got to wondering if I could use it for office hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real life office hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe bloggy "office hours?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I've got a feed running live &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/isis-s-office-window"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where you can see out my office window while I sit an work.  Check out the chat features and what-not &lt;/p&gt;

Saginaw Hwy, Lansing, MI 48917. This restaurant is on the north side of the street, same as the Buffet World Restaurant where we held our meeting last month, and is on the strip mall just east of Mall Drive that runs N-S between these 2 restaurants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are delighted in having John W. Loftus as our featured speaker at this month’s meeting. John is a reformed evangelist and is author of the book, &lt;em&gt;Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity&lt;/em&gt;. He will enlighten us with his latest thoughts on the subject of religion based on his life journey over the years. Following the presentation will be a question and answer period. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6627168729233193805?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

If Y=1, the result is a circle. Y&amp;lt;1 creates a spiral inside the circle and Y&amp;gt;1 creates a spiral outside the circle. The logarithmic spiral is a very natural and fractal form, and being in the biology field and a fractal freak, I was captivated by this figure. Then the philosopher in me started seeing all the symbolism one could glean from this and it was all over. The other side of the story is that after 3 years of cortisone shots, physical therapy, surgery, more therapy and acupuncture to treat tendonitis in my right elbow, my arm is finally back to “as good as it’s going to get”.

There are too many bivalves and not enough researchers - remember that we live in a world in which we can't even determine lobster ages with any degree of certainty. Like many bivalves, lobster biochemistry doesn't seem to change with age in any usefully measurable way. You might recall research into the longevity of another bivalve, the arctic quahog clam, that suggests its longevity is a matter of excellent natural antioxidants: The ocean quahog Arctica islandica is the longest-lived of all bivalve and molluscan species on earth. Animals close to 400 years are common and reported maximum live span around Iceland is close to 400 years. High and stable antioxidant capacities are a possible strategy to slow senescence and extend lifespan Compare that with this recent open access paper on the pearl mussel wherein the researchers found a different story when looking at superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT): Free radicals are extremely reactive and produce damage and modify cell functions.

As always, you should &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/28/rating-articles-in-plos-one/" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/04/07/why-post-comments-on-plos-one/" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/04/the-how-and-why-of-trackbacks/" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Mendeley, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000573" title=""&gt;Circadian Clock Genes Contribute to the Regulation of Hair Follicle Cycling&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The hair follicle renews itself by repeatedly cycling among growth, regression, and rest phases. One function of hair follicle cycling is to allow seasonal changes in hair growth. Understanding the regulation of hair follicle cycling is also of interest because abnormal regulation of hair cycle control genes is responsible for several types of human hair growth disorders and skin cancers. We report here that Clock and Bmal1 genes, which control circadian rhythms, are also important for the regulation of hair follicle cycling, a biological process of much longer duration than 24 hours. Detailed analysis of skin from mice mutated for central clock genes indicates a significant delay in the progression of the hair growth phase. We show that clock genes affect the expression of key cell cycle control genes and that keratinocytes in a critical compartment of the hair follicles in Bmal1 mutant mice are halted in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These findings provide novel insight into circadian control mechanisms in modulating the progression of cyclic biological processes on different time scales.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006369" title=""&gt;Impact of Selection and Demography on the Diffusion of Lactase Persistence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The lactase enzyme allows lactose digestion in fresh milk. Its activity strongly decreases after the weaning phase in most humans, but persists at a high frequency in Europe and some nomadic populations. Two hypotheses are usually proposed to explain the particular distribution of the lactase persistence phenotype. The gene-culture coevolution hypothesis supposes a nutritional advantage of lactose digestion in pastoral populations. The calcium assimilation hypothesis suggests that carriers of the lactase persistence allele(s) (LCT*P) are favoured in high-latitude regions, where sunshine is insufficient to allow accurate vitamin-D synthesis. In this work, we test the validity of these two hypotheses on a large worldwide dataset of lactase persistence frequencies by using several complementary approaches. We first analyse the distribution of lactase persistence in various continents in relation to geographic variation, pastoralism levels, and the genetic patterns observed for other independent polymorphisms. Then we use computer simulations and a large database of archaeological dates for the introduction of domestication to explore the evolution of these frequencies in Europe according to different demographic scenarios and selection intensities. Our results show that gene-culture coevolution is a likely hypothesis in Africa as high LCT*P frequencies are preferentially found in pastoral populations. In Europe, we show that population history played an important role in the diffusion of lactase persistence over the continent. Moreover, selection pressure on lactase persistence has been very high in the North-western part of the continent, by contrast to the South-eastern part where genetic drift alone can explain the observed frequencies. This selection pressure increasing with latitude is highly compatible with the calcium assimilation hypothesis while the gene-culture coevolution hypothesis cannot be ruled out if a positively selected lactase gene was carried at the front of the expansion wave during the Neolithic transition in Europe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000486" title=""&gt;Bioluminescent Imaging of Trypanosoma brucei Shows Preferential Testis Dissemination Which May Hamper Drug Efficacy in Sleeping Sickness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, caused by two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei, is endemic in Subsaharan Africa. There is no vaccine and the currently used drugs are toxic and can cause severe side effects and even death. At present, we do not know how and when parasites can leave the blood and penetrate into organs (especially the brain). Such knowledge will be very helpful to develop and validate new drugs that can clear the parasite from both the blood and the tissues. In this study, we developed a novel technique allowing us to track the parasites in a live animal by the use of light signals. By following the luminescent parasites in the mouse we showed that, interestingly, the organisms migrate very early in infection to the testes. Here, they may be protected from the immune system and from drugs. Indeed when treating the mice with a sub-optimal dose of medicine, the parasites in this location were not cleared and subsequently could cause a reinvasion into the blood of the host.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006391" title=""&gt;Does Genetic Diversity Predict Health in Humans?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genetic diversity, especially at genes important for immune functioning within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), has been associated with fitness-related traits, including disease resistance, in many species. Recently, genetic diversity has been associated with mate preferences in humans. Here we asked whether these preferences are adaptive in terms of obtaining healthier mates. We investigated whether genetic diversity (heterozygosity and standardized mean d2) at MHC and nonMHC microsatellite loci, predicted health in 153 individuals. Individuals with greater allelic diversity (d2) at nonMHC loci and at one MHC locus, linked to HLA-DRB1, reported fewer symptoms over a four-month period than individuals with lower d2. In contrast, there were no associations between MHC or nonMHC heterozygosity and health. NonMHC-d2 has previously been found to predict male preferences for female faces. Thus, the current findings suggest that nonMHC diversity may play a role in both natural and sexual selection acting on human populations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000570" title=""&gt;Coevolution of Interacting Fertilization Proteins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When a sperm meets an egg, it must display the correct recognition proteins to achieve fertilization. Given the importance of fertilization one would think these proteins are perfected and do not change over time; however, recent studies show that they do change and quite rapidly. Thus, the sperm and egg must change together in harmony, through a process called coevolution, so the species can successfully reproduce. We followed the sperm-egg coevolutionary process at the level of genes: one that makes the protective egg coat and a sperm gene which opens that coat for fertilization. By examining their DNA sequences in two abalone species, we revealed two coevolutionary signatures. In one case, we discovered an association of variants between the egg and sperm genes, the origin of which could be strong preference for compatible variants. In the second case, we demonstrated that both genes changed at correlated rates over millions of years of evolution. Whenever one gene had accelerated in one species, the other showed a parallel acceleration in that same species. These unique signatures help us to understand coevolution by revealing its strength within natural populations and by showing that it has acted consistently over long time periods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006383" title=""&gt;Saccadic Compression of Rectangle and Kanizsa Figures: Now You See It, Now You Don't&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Observers misperceive the location of points within a scene as compressed towards the goal of a saccade. However, recent studies suggest that saccadic compression does not occur for discrete elements such as dots when they are perceived as unified objects like a rectangle. We investigated the magnitude of horizontal vs. vertical compression for Kanizsa figure (a collection of discrete elements unified into single perceptual objects by illusory contours) and control rectangle figures. Participants were presented with Kanizsa and control figures and had to decide whether the horizontal or vertical length of stimulus was longer using the two-alternative force choice method. Our findings show that large but not small Kanizsa figures are perceived as compressed, that such compression is large in the horizontal dimension and small or nil in the vertical dimension. In contrast to recent findings, we found no saccadic compression for control rectangles. Our data suggest that compression of Kanizsa figure has been overestimated in previous research due to methodological artifacts, and highlight the importance of studying perceptual phenomena by multiple methods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006364" title=""&gt;The Roles and Interactions of Symbiont, Host and Environment in Defining Coral Fitness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reef-building corals live in symbiosis with a diverse range of dinoflagellate algae (genus Symbiodinium) that differentially influence the fitness of the coral holobiont. The comparative role of symbiont type in holobiont fitness in relation to host genotype or the environment, however, is largely unknown. We addressed this knowledge gap by manipulating host-symbiont combinations and comparing growth, survival and thermal tolerance among the resultant holobionts in different environments. Offspring of the coral, Acropora millepora, from two thermally contrasting locations, were experimentally infected with one of six Symbiodinium types, which spanned three phylogenetic clades (A, C and D), and then outplanted to the two parental field locations (central and southern inshore Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Growth and survival of juvenile corals were monitored for 31-35 weeks, after which their thermo-tolerance was experimentally assessed. Our results showed that: (1) Symbiodinium type was the most important predictor of holobiont fitness, as measured by growth, survival, and thermo-tolerance; (2) growth and survival, but not heat-tolerance, were also affected by local environmental conditions; and (3) host population had little to no effect on holobiont fitness. Furthermore, coral-algal associations were established with symbiont types belonging to clades A, C and D, but three out of four symbiont types belonging to clade C failed to establish a symbiosis. Associations with clade A had the lowest fitness and were unstable in the field. Lastly, Symbiodinium types C1 and D were found to be relatively thermo-tolerant, with type D conferring the highest tolerance in A. millepora. These results highlight the complex interactions that occur between the coral host, the algal symbiont, and the environment to shape the fitness of the coral holobiont. An improved understanding of the factors affecting coral holobiont fitness will assist in predicting the responses of corals to global climate change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marriage commissioner &lt;strong&gt;Orville Nichols&lt;/strong&gt; was asked to perform a marriage for “M.J.”  When he discovered that M.J.’s partner was the same sex, Nichols backed away, because he believes that “God hates homosexuality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M.J. filed a human rights complaint, won the case, and was awarded $2,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichols appealed, and last week, the ruling was issued: &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2009/07/23/marriage-ruling.html"&gt;Nichols was wrong; religion is not a legitimate excuse to deny someone their rights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Court of Queen’s Bench decision was praised Thursday by the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To allow a public official to insert their personal beliefs into decisions about who should and who should not receive a public service would undermine the protection of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code,” said Human Rights Commission manager Rebecca McLellan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well put.  Nichols is a government official, not a priest.  His salary is paid using taxpayers’ money.  He is in no position to discriminate.  His bigotry must remain within his church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine if Nichols refused to marry a Muslim couple?  An atheist couple?  A black couple?  An interracial couple?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is simple: if you’re a federally-funded marriage commissioner, you can’t refuse to marry a couple because you think God forbids their love or their beliefs go against your theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, a Christian pharmacist is shaking in his boots.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve always wondered what they meant by that, since I’m not doing anything I know of to prevent people from seeking whatever treatments they want for themselves or their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I’m trying to do is give people information. If they are already happy with the information they have, if they have already found “The Truth”, all they have to do is ignore me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a recent conversation, it &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; came to me what all of those parents (and not a few practitioners) have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; been telling me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; bothers people is not that I am somehow standing in the way of them getting the treatments they think their children need – which is patently ridiculous - but that I am threatening their false hope. To borrow from the jargon of my youth, I’m &lt;em&gt;killing their buzz&lt;/em&gt;. [Note: for people who were not part of the psychedelic '60's, this means that I am interfering with their enjoyment of an unreal state of mind]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; it all makes sense! You see, while real hope is &lt;em&gt;based &lt;/em&gt;in reality, false hope is &lt;em&gt;destroyed&lt;/em&gt;  by reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some level, these angry parents &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that their hope isn’t real - &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; why they are so angry with me for speaking truth to fantasy. If they were &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; convinced that they were right, they wouldn’t get so upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If - for example - they were treating their child with antibiotics for pneumonia and somebody on a ‘blog somewhere in cyberspace was writing that antibiotics are &lt;em&gt;worthless&lt;/em&gt; for treating infections and are all just a sham to make money for doctors and “Big Pharma” (which, sad to say, has been written on at least one ‘blog), I doubt that they would be upset. &lt;em&gt;Amused&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps, but not upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with false hope is that it is - at its heart - a &lt;em&gt;lie&lt;/em&gt;. The people who provide the false hope may not consciously &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that it is a lie and the people who believe in the false hope almost certainly aren’t &lt;em&gt;consciously&lt;/em&gt; aware that it’s a lie, but it is a lie nonetheless. And, as most of us have discovered, one lie is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; enough - to keep the first lie going, you have to tell more lies. This is true even when you are lying to &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt;. You can see this in the way that many of the so-called “alternative” autism therapies are rationalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at thimerosal and chelation, as an example. First, it was claimed that the rise in autism prevalence was due to mercury in the vaccines and that chelation would produce a cure. At first, it was claimed that a “few months” of chelation would “cure” or “recover” most autistic children. When this didn’t happen, the claims slipped from “months” to “years” without explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thimerosal was taken out of children’s vaccines, it was claimed that the &lt;em&gt;continued&lt;/em&gt; rise in autism prevalence was due to “trace” amounts of mercury still in vaccines (disregarding the fact that the amount of mercury was &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; less than &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the “autism epidemic”). When &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was challenged, it was claimed that mercury from power plants, crematoria and even drifting across the ocean from &lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt; was the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; proved untenable, the claim morphed from mercury to more vague (and harder to refute) “toxins” and then to the lamentable “too many, too soon” argument - the acme of vague and undefined. All this to prevent a group of people from confronting the fact that they are living on (or profiting by) false hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a good time to introduce the concept of “cognitive dissonance”. Cognitive dissonance – in simple terms – is the sense of unease people feel when they are trying to reconcile two contradictory ideas. In most people, this occurs when what they &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; to be true (fantasy) is in conflict with what they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; is true (reality). This is an uncomfortable place to be, psychologically, and most people (so my psychologist friends tell me) will avoid it if they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to deal with cognitive dissonance is to resolve it – to consciously decide &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; of the contradictory ideas to keep and which to discard. Apparently, in conflicts between fantasy and reality, it makes no difference to your sense of well-being whether you discard the fantasy or the reality. Of course, if you discard reality in favor of fantasy, you will sooner or later encounter new opportunities to experience cognitive dissonance, as your false view of reality repeatedly comes in conflict with reality itself. It’s a bit like someone deciding that they would &lt;em&gt;rather&lt;/em&gt; be driving through Colorado and so uses a Colorado road map, despite the fact that they are in Kansas – they keep bumping into situations where their false reality is contradicted (often quite &lt;em&gt;forcefully&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my psychologist friends tell me that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people faced with cognitive dissonance use “avoidance” rather than facing their conflict and resolving it. They simply avoid, ignore or flee from situations where their fantasy is in conflict with reality. Over time, the “places” (physical and psychological) that they have to avoid grow in number. Interestingly, they &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; tend to lash out at people who remind them of their unresolved conflict, often accusing them of some sort of personal &lt;em&gt;attack&lt;/em&gt; when none exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; sound like anyone you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, this insight provides me with a faint glimmer of hope. Clearly, the people who lash out when they are confronted with information have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; yet resolved to abandon reality. They are still bothered – at some level – by the fact that their fantasies about autism are not supported by reality. There is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; some hope that they will eventually – when the pain of their cognitive dissonance is severe enough – decide to give reality a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my job is to keep flinging reality at these folks until they are forced to make a choice. And hope they choose reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just call me “Captain Buzz-Kill”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before someone accuses me of gloating or &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt;, let me say that I was one of those parents who bought the false hope and experienced the cognitive dissonance. I have &lt;em&gt;immense&lt;/em&gt; sympathy for parents who find themselves in the same position today (or tomorrow). My purpose is not to ridicule them but to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; them to find a way out of their dilemma. I’ve been there and I know a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are a &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; people who will be unable to make a choice – or will feel compelled to choose fantasy over reality. They are people who have stepped so far into the false hope of autism that they feel they cannot turn away. Some of them have “invested” their reputations in a very public way (often publically excoriating – and even slandering – people who disagreed with them) and may feel that the humiliation of admitting that they were wrong would be greater than the humiliation of persisting in error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have profited greatly from the false hope they believed in and feel they cannot choose reality without facing real consequences. For these people, the cognitive dissonance is far less than the fear of the wrath of the parents who bought their false hope. I note that while several ”DAN!” (a group emphasizing the “alternative” and “biomedical” treatment of autism) practitioners have quietly dropped out of the “autism business”, few (or none) have publically admitted they were wrong. Perhaps none of them &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that they were wrong and they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dropped out of “alternative” autism practice to “spend more time with their family” or “to limit their practice”, but I like to think that at least one or two of them “saw the light” and quietly slipped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have any easy solutions for those “alternative” autism practitioners who find themselves facing the conflict between their autism fantasies and cold reality. They &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have known better - at least better that the parents who trusted their expertise and followed their suggestions. However, even &lt;em&gt;doctors&lt;/em&gt; are human and make mistakes. The best solution is to admit the mistake – at least to themselves – and move on in the proper direction. It would be an even &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; mistake to keep on “believing” in order to evade the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of these debates because the Creationist side never has anything relevant to say, and Ray Comfort is no exception.  By debating his kind, we are merely giving Creationists the satisfaction of thinking they have something valuable to offer, when in fact they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the tape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/N2FskTKrx40%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want proof this type of debate is useless?  Here’s a brief excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;/strong&gt;: So what was in the beginning?  How did all this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderf00t&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, there is the assumption that there was a beginning.  I mean, this is what we would call in scientific terms an “unknown.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;/strong&gt;: You don’t know what was in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thunderf00t&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s unknown.  There are things that we know and the things that we don’t know and there are, as [Donald] Rumsfeld would say, there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;/strong&gt;: I gotta stop you there because I know what was in the beginning.  You don’t know.  I know what was in the beginning.  In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth.  You don’t know. I do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they move on to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud Thunderf00t for attempting to converse with Comfort, but this is no better than a &lt;em&gt;Nightline&lt;/em&gt; debate, which is to say good for ratings but useless to advance the dialogue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The title, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/health/24flu.html?_r=1&amp;amp;partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;Swine Flu May Cause Seizures in Children&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; intrigued me.

flu&lt;/a&gt; may cause &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Seizures." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/seizures/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt;, 
after four children were hospitalized in Texas for neurological complications.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;All four children fully recovered without complications after being treated 
at a Dallas hospital, according to a &lt;a title="CDC MMWR Report." href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/mmwrnews/2009/n090723.htm"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released 
Thursday by the &lt;a title="More articles about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/centers_for_disease_control_and_prevention/index.html?inline=nyt-org"&gt;Centers

Top health officials are reporting that swine flu causes seizures? Based on 4 cases? Hm.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read on....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and then I see paragraphs 3-4 (as an aside, can we call 1 sentence a paragraph?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The announcement does not surprise doctors accustomed to seeing complications 
in the brain caused by the seasonal &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Influenza." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; 
viruses that circulate every year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It's completely to be expected given that so far this novel H1N1 flu is 
behaving like the seasonal flu that we are familiar with," said &lt;a title="Dr. Moscona&amp;#39;s profile." href="http://www.weillcornell.org/amoscona/"&gt;Dr. 
Anne Moscona&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of &lt;a title="Recent and archival health news about pediatrics." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/pediatrics/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; 
and microbiology at the &lt;a title="More articles about New York-Presbyterian Hospital" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_york-presbyterian_hospital/index.html?inline=nyt-org"&gt;Weill 
Cornell Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Isis thinks to herself, &amp;quot;waaaaaaaaaaait a minute here.&amp;quot;  So, she clicks through and reads the one &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/mmwrnews/2009/n090723.htm#2"&gt;paragraph CDC report&lt;/a&gt; which states (I'm gonna bold, underline, etc the relevant parts for your viewing pleasure):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em&gt;For children who have flu-like symptoms accompanied by unexplained seizures 
or mental status changes, &lt;b&gt;clinicians should consider acute seasonal influenza &lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt; 
novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection as a diagnosis&lt;/b&gt;, send specimens for 
appropriate testing, and promptly begin treatment with antiviral drugs, 
especially in hospitalized patients.&lt;/em&gt; This article reports on four children 
who were hospitalized in Texas with neurological complications of novel 
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. All four recovered fully and were sent home 
without any neurological symptoms. This report highlights the potential for 
children with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection to experience 
neurological complications. &lt;b&gt;Physicians who are caring for children hospitalized 
with influenza-like illness and unexplained seizures or mental status changes 
should consider that the neurological symptoms may be related to influenza,&lt;/b&gt; send 
respiratory specimens for testing, and start treatment with antiviral 
medications used against flu.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What the physicians quoted in the article and the CDC report are saying, contrary to the misleading title Dr. Arnquist has chosen for us poor suckers, is not that novel H1N1 is unique in that it causes seizures.  It&amp;#39;s that H1N1 is like other strains of influenza and, as &lt;a href="http://utahinternalmedicine.com/pageview.aspx?id=14689"&gt;Dr. Andrew Paiva&lt;/a&gt; tells us at the end of the article:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The usefulness of this case report is that many doctors who deal with outpatient 
flu only may never have seen a case with neurological complications," Dr. Pavia 
said. "It's an important reminder [to physicians] that flu can present as seizures or as &lt;a title="In-depth reference and news articles about Encephalitis." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/encephalitis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I grow weary of these gonzo-esque headlines designed to troll people into reading.  Now, granted, Sarah Arnquist&amp;#39;s title is factually correct, but how many people will read that headline and get even more anxious, worried that swine flu is about bring about Armageddon, without reading the rest or the article?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People wonder why scientists and physicians don't trust the popular media?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, I suppose less people will click, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Effects of&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;swine flu just like other seasonal influenza.  Physicians should treat it the same&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;quot;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why can't &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/nicholasdkristof/index.html"&gt;Nicholas Kristof&lt;/a&gt; just write all of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;?  I love that guy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent post on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sexual_abuse_and_safety"&gt;sexual abuse and safety&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote that it's highly likely that many cases of abuse against individuals with disabilities may well go unreported. 11-year-old Stefan Ferrari, who is autistic, was abused by an adult at his Atlanta area school; after noting that he came home from school with bruises, Stefan's mother sewed a microphone into his clothes and heard inappropriate comments. As reported by &lt;a href="http://www.wxia11.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=130355&amp;amp;catid=40"&gt;WXIA&lt;/a&gt; on July 17th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teacher Sherri Jones admitted on the stand to making the inappropriate comments. But she denied ever hitting Stefan -- and the judge never named the adult whom he believes caused these injuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones continued to teach for eight months after the alleged abuse, continued to teach after admitting to inappropriate behavior on the witness stand. She was not removed from the classroom until the day after the 11Alive News story aired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ferraris went to DFACS, the police, the schools -- and no one helped them. It took suing the Atlanta Public Schools and telling their story to the media to get justice for their son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Ferraris' experience, the governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue, is starting a group to create a new statewide policy on reporting abuse in the school system. The group is to include "educational leaders, law enforcement and abuse experts" and every family in Georgia will receive a copy of the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the policy, here's a call to Governor Perdue to think pro-actively and see that training and supervision of teachers and parapros is in place to prevent abuse and mistreatment of students with disabilities from happening in the first place. We know that such abuse happens, and, rather than letting it happen over and over, we need to address it from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248472926525"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14181">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/80e3c8e482f900c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">God Is Not Your Bitch, Mark Sanford</title><published>2009-07-24T22:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T22:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/24/god-is-not-your-bitch-mark-sanford/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If newspapers are in danger of going out of business, this is certainly one way to draw in the eyes of readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Morford&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; wrote an article poking fun at Governor &lt;strong&gt;Mark Sanford&lt;/strong&gt;’s recent comments about how “&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/19/did-governor-mark-sanford-miss-this-bible-verse/"&gt;God will make him better&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

After all, if much of organized religion and nearly every conservative/fundamentalist adherent thereof are to be believed — and they most definitely are not — God is essentially the most obsessed, niggling micromanager of all time. He is all about being hugely, nay downright &lt;em&gt;obscenely&lt;/em&gt; interested in the trivial minutiae of modern life, from the food eaten on a particular day to the touchdown made during the Big Game to the brand of TV you watch it on, right on over to what book you’re reading and where you live and if you have the right guns and foreign policy and facial hair, and of course whether or not you judge gay people and demean women and nonbelievers in just the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because only then, when all preposterous criteria are met, might God absolve you, or lead you toward happiness, or grant success to your new laundromat, or forgive you your trespasses and your recreational drug use and your pornographic thoughts about your massage therapist, or even how many soft, cooing sounds you made over the body of a sexy Argenitine [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] female. Isn’t that right, Gov. Sanford?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when was the last time you saw something like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in your hometown paper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More, please.&lt;/p&gt;

He is one of the people with a firearms license, so he was on bear duty.  And a good thing, as he spotted a mother and cub (the most dangerous situation) not far from where the researchers and students were.  In fact, Paul Hebert -- ever the intrepid naturalist -- had trudged farther ahead and was unaware of the bears' proximity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Smn_rlsKiRI/AAAAAAAAAuk/siZIP-Hw7CM/s1600-h/006.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:298px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Smn_rlsKiRI/AAAAAAAAAuk/siZIP-Hw7CM/s400/006.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul and Joao, before anyone noticed the bears (see the two white objects off to the right).

It was a large male polar bear.  The group retreated to the van and everyone was fine, though I suspect some hearts were pounding nonetheless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another update:&lt;br&gt;Apparently there was a bear very close to the station today that was chased away by the staff.  With the ice melted, the bears are moving back in land.

I was met with many comments -- both positive and negative -- discussing this position.  So I'd like to, first off, find out what your opinions on it are:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that there are many other deciding factors on whether you think the answer should be yes or no, but I'd like you to pick the closest one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, a combination of the first and third reasons are why I am compelled to say yes.  This is important, because I freely admit that I believe &lt;i&gt;the scientific merits of a manned mission to Mars are very slight.&lt;/i&gt;  There is, at this point, nothing that humans can do over there that robots, telescopes, orbiters, etc., couldn't do at a tiny fraction of the cost and risk.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But -- and as a scientist, this is a tough admission -- we have more to consider than just science.  NASA was not originally a scientific organization, although it accomplished (and continues to accomplish) some great science.  It was originally a &lt;i&gt;military&lt;/i&gt; organization, and my point is that I believe the purposes of NASA projects &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;should&lt;/b&gt; go beyond the purely scientific.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, think about the Apollo program.  The Soviets had landed a probe on the Moon nearly a decade before.  Was it really important to have humans on it?  For science, not really.  But for humanity, &lt;i&gt;what a step!&lt;/i&gt;  With Neil Armstrong's first step, we became -- as far as we know -- the first species &lt;b&gt;in the entire Universe&lt;/b&gt; to travel to a world other than our own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, dreams of space tourism and space colonization seemed a reality.  40 years later, the best thing we've got is the ISS, a somewhat habitable buoy in orbit.  Why are we not &lt;i&gt;encouraging&lt;/i&gt; space tourism?  Why are we not ferrying civilians up to the ISS for parties?  Sure, it might cost 50 billion dollars to go to Mars the &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; time, and maybe all the astronauts who go will die there, but there are nearly seven billion of us who'd love to someday be able to go.  Great achievements require great courage, and a great reward never comes without great risk.  Although I wasn't yet alive for it, I don't know anyone who watched the Moon landing who wasn't living vicariously through Neil and Buzz.  And most of the people I know who saw it had dreams of someone just like them being able to do it too.  Although science fiction excites people's imaginations, it pales in comparison to when the &lt;i&gt;real thing&lt;/i&gt; catches up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not talking about warp speed or teleportation or any type of fiction; I'm talking about visiting or even living on another planet!  If it were possible, wouldn't &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; want a seat on that flight?  (Even if only one out of a thousand people say yes, that's millions of people who'll go!)  This is one of the greatest dreams of humanity, and we have the technology, resources, and abilities to make it happen &lt;b&gt;if&lt;/b&gt; we choose to invest in it.  If we committed to it, we could launch for it in 10 years.  This has been true since the 1990s, but we'd have to commit to it.  Not a return to the Moon, not requiring the invention of new technologies, just using what we've got right now to go to Mars.  It'll be risky, people will probably die, and the journey will likely be one-way.  But the adventure is worth the risk, and the reward is worth the investment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although it's a secondary reason for me, it may someday be &lt;b&gt;profitable&lt;/b&gt;, not just through tourism but &lt;i&gt;industrially&lt;/i&gt;, to go to Mars.  Why are we not trying to identify and market Mars' unique, untapped resources?  Because yes, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; resources there.  Like what?  Helium, for one.  Know how we get helium on Earth?  We find an underground deposit of radioactive material that decays via &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"&gt;alpha decay&lt;/a&gt;, producing helium.  It takes millions and billions of years for these deposits to build up.  We've already mined nearly all of it on Earth, so when we're out, we're out.  Except that there are surely radioactive deposits on Mars, and thus the same helium mines, &lt;b&gt;completely untapped&lt;/b&gt;.  We also have reasons to believe Mars is a rich source of deuterium, a rare and expensive isotope on Earth.  Who knows what else might be useful there?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, that's what I think.  There's really no science about it; this is a chance for humanity to make one of our dreams come true.  How many opportunities do we get in our lifetimes to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; make one of our dreams come true?  So whenever the chance arises, you know what I'll be pushing for.  And I hope that you'll push with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/should_we_go_to_mars_or_not.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248468317794"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/24/space-travel-isnt-funny-well-ok-maybe-it-is-a-little/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e79a30f251b8886f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Space travel isn’t funny.

&lt;p&gt;They prayed, fasted, put their hands on her, and anointed her with oil… which to me sounds like they knew something was wrong but actively chose to deny her real help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another case with similar details, the mother was found guilty of &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/22/neumann-guilty-of-second-degree-reckless-homicide/"&gt;second-degree reckless homicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to the Worthingtons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father, Carl Brent Worthington, was &lt;a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty_impact/2009/07/worthington_jury_has_reached_a/print.html"&gt;found guilty of “criminal mistreatment”&lt;/a&gt; but not guilty of manslaughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother, Raylene Worthington, was found not guilty on both charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So neither parent was convicted of manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presiding juror’s explanation doesn’t help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Granted, they didn’t take her (Ava) to the hospital, but it was truly because they thought she was getting better,” [presiding juror Ashlee] Santos said. “That was the best epiphany moment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It might be that a reasonable person might wait until Monday to take their kid to the doctor,” she said. “It came down to being the perfect storm of events that ended in where we are now, with her death.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re good parents who tried everything they knew in their heart. … They thought what they did was working,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t the Worthingtons call 9-1-1 or attempt to revive her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it didn’t cross their mind, because that’s their life,” Santos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all know they (the Worthingtons) didn’t do it on purpose, that they had no intention of harming their child,” Santos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Oregon law, manslaughter is not defined as an intentional killing but as accidental death that the defendant has a legal responsibility to prevent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one’s doubting they didn’t do it on purpose.  But their reckless actions killed their daughter.  They had the ability to stop that and they chose not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this case becomes precedent, more children will die because of the delusions of religious parents who don’t “trust” science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for any upside to this case, it may be that the Worthingtons were “legally prohibited from offering a religious defense.”  Their lawyers successfully showed that the parents thought Ava was getting better and that’s why they didn’t take her to the hospital.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Ava is thrilled about that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thegoodatheist.net/2009/07/faith-healing-couple-acquitted/"&gt;The Good Atheist adds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I wouldn’t have cared if either of these two morons had died of medical complication themselves. After all, I do still agree that individuals should be free to do what they want with their own bodies. What I strongly disagree with is the idea that their beliefs should carry over to others. Their responsibility was towards the welfare of their child, one that they were unable to perform because of their idiotic religious convictions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems religiously-inspired negligence &lt;a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/clackamascounty_impact/2009/07/worthington_jury_has_reached_a/print.html"&gt;runs in the family&lt;/a&gt;, too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The church and prosecutors will meet again in court early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raylene Worthington’s parents, Jeff and Marci Beagley, go on trial in January. They are charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of their 16-year-old, Neil Beagley, who died last June of an untreated urinary tract blockage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Bobby&lt;/strong&gt; offers this thought via email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I hate to needlessly pile on to these people and the tragedies their family is going through (due to their own negligence, but sad nonetheless). But with two children dead in your family within months, isn’t it about time to start asking your god some tough questions?  At the very least, “what have you done for me lately?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The good news is that I've been recovering just as quickly as I crashed. By Thursday morning, my 101.3 fever had broken, and while I still have a cough, the aches and chills are now largely gone.

Heh, what can I say, it's cheap and a crowd-pleaser.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with a standard pizza with yer basic toppings, we did a sort of "shrimp pad thai"-inspired pizza and a beet, goat cheese, and pistachio pizza.  The former was a big hit, the latter was alright but was kinda dry and seemed like it was missing something.  Maybe some other kind of cheese?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, no pictures, but approximate recipes below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Shrimp pad thai" pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3/4 lb uncooked shrimp, peeled and deveined&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp peanut oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5-6 garlic cloves, minced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 Thai chile peppers, minced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 scallions, chopped&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 Tbsp chopped cilantro&lt;li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-2 Tbsp Thai green curry paste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 14-oz. can coconut milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp fish sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup finely chopped peanuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 Tbsp basil &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiffonade"&gt;chiffonade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 med. orange or red bell pepper, sliced into rings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;small handful of bean sprouts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;your favorite pizza crust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combine shrimp, soy sauce, 1/4 cup peanut oil, half of minced garlic, and about a third of minced chile peppers in a medium bowl.  Toss to coat.  Place in refridgerator to marinate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp peanut oil over medium heat and add scallions, half of cilantro, and remaining garlic.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic and white parts of scallion start to soften, about 3-4 minutes.  Add curry paste and stir until aromatic, about one minute longer.  Add coconut milk.  If desired, dilute with some chicken broth (I kindof wish I had done this...).  Simmer until flavors start to combine, about 5-10 minutes.  Add fish sauce and 1/4 cup chopped peanuts, and simmer a little longer, about 3 minutes.  Add basil and remove from heat.  Set aside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preheat broiler.  Remove shrimp from marinade and place on broiler pan.  When broiler is ready, place shrimp six inches from heating element and cook until starting to caramelize on the outside, about 3-4 minutes per side.  Remove shrimp and set oven to 425 degrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will probably want to pre-cook the crust a bit, as the ingredients on the pizza don't really need to cook much and there is no cheese to melt.  When crust is fairly close to done, spread enough of the sauce on crust to cover it, and then evenly distribute bell peppers, bean sprouts, and shrimp over crust.  Top with remaining 1/4 cup chopped peanuts.  Bake about another 5-10 minutes, being careful not to let the peanuts get burnt.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining cilantro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beet, goat cheese, and pistachio pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;mixture of extra virgin olive oil and minced garlic&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-3 medium beets, roasted and then chopped into 1/4" cubes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;~3 Tbsp goat cheese, crumbled&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/3 cup finely chopped pistachios&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup chopped pea greens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;your favorite pizza crust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spread olive oil and garlic mixture over crust to cover.  Evenly distribute beets, goat cheese, and pistachios over the crust.  Sprinkle Parmesan over top.  Bake until crust reaches desired crispness.  Sprinkle with pea greens just before serving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;I've started experimenting with mincing a bunch of garlic and putting it in a jar in the fridge with extra virgin olive oil -- you know, kinda like that jar you can buy at the supermarket, only way better because it's homemade from fresh ingredients with no preservatives or other funky shit.  If you don't have this on hand, it should be fine to just spread the olive oil on the crust followed by a reasonable amount of minced garlic.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, a couple problems with these recipes:  The Thai pizza was delicious, but too heavy.  As I mentioned in the recipe, probably it would be better to dilute the coconut milk with some chicken broth.  Possibly also using low-fat coconut milk might be a good idea.  Also, be warned, it's a bit spicy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The beet pizza was interesting but a bit dry.  Mariah thinks maybe adding some fontina cheese would have improved it.  I had mozzarella on hand, but I think it would have been weird.  Also, although I enjoyed them, Mariah didn't care for the raw pea greens on top.  To each his own...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3116595817721790807?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248465984360"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-8959942552334830678">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4840ba34d2bbb139</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="sikhism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Can I demand an atheist police officer?</title><published>2009-07-24T17:45:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T17:45:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/can-i-demand-atheist-police-officer.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8161547.stm"&gt;Beeb reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sikh victims of crime in London are to be given the option of asking for a police officer of their own faith to work on their case.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It might not actually be &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; horrible of an idea.

Give me a break. Sure, they were atheists. But they did not kill because they were atheists. Hitler was a fanatical racist and Mao and Stalin fanatical communists, and they killed in the name of those fundamentalist philosophies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's ignore Hitler for a second, because his religious beliefs are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler&amp;#39;s_religious_beliefs"&gt;not at all clear&lt;/a&gt;.  So let's focus on Stalin and Mao, who were both unambiguous about their &lt;i&gt;nominal&lt;/i&gt; atheism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am going to one step further than The Economist, and argue (as I have in the comments on other blogs) that Stalin and Mao were not actually atheists in any useful sense of the word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atheism is usually defined as the lack of a belief in a god or gods.  Okay, so how do we define the word "god"?  Well, you could write a frikkin' book about that, but certainly some important elements would be infallibility, omnipotence/absolute control, etc.  There exists another concept to which these attributes are integral: the totalitarian state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any useful definition of atheism -- or at least, of secularism -- has to reject the idea of a single uncompromising source of authority.  Otherwise, the definition gets watered down to something almost meaningless, e.g. atheism is the lack of belief in Jesus, Buddah, Yahweh, Shiva, Brahma, Zeus, Thor, etc.  In order for the definition to be useful, there must be a functional definition of what beliefs atheism rejects, rather than just a laundry list of deities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a totalitarianist dictatorship, the dictator &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; god, by any useful functional definition.  He&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is all-powerful.  He cannot be questioned.  His command(ment)s must be obeyed.  In the case of post-Mao China, there was not a single dictator but it was still a totalitarianist state, and in that case the bureaucracy fills the role of god.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still don't believe me?  North Korea has even had the good grace to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche"&gt;formally codify&lt;/a&gt; the country's totalitarian ideals as a religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are skeptical about this expansive definition of god(s), consider the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven&amp;#39;s_Gate_(religious_group)"&gt;Heaven's Gate cultists&lt;/a&gt;.  Certainly they did not appear to believe in god(s) in the traditional sense, but it would be laughable to refer to them as a "secular" or "atheist" group.  Clearly they were not.  To me, it is equally clear that Stalinist Russia could not be reasonably labeled as secular or atheist, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wait, you say, even if we accept that Stalinism and Maoism are not actually atheistic belief systems, that doesn't mean that Stalin or Mao couldn't be atheist!  Well, sort of.  We can ask whether Stalin really believed in his heart that he had the wisdom to command all of the Soviet Union, but not only is this question unanswerable, it is ultimately irrelevant.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is almost a surety that some fraction of the Catholic priests who have been convicted of child molestation had internally abandoned their faith prior to their despicable actions... does this mean that the molestations were now committed by atheist priests, and that atheists must answer for their actions?  No, of course not.  The priests were part of the Catholic infrastructure, they self-identified as Catholics, so we have little choice but to say they are Catholics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the same token, it's possible -- maybe even likely -- that Stalin and Mao did not actually believe in their own infallibility.  But to say that this means they weren't truly totalitarianists is about as meaningful as saying that maybe &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koresh"&gt;David Koresh&lt;/a&gt; didn't literally believe he was a prophet and therefore he wasn't a Branch Davidian.  That's retarded.  Stalin and Mao preached totalitarianism, therefore they were totalitarianists, not atheists.  End of story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In short: It is my contention that secular totalitarianism is an oxymoron.  Totalitarianism by its very nature is non-secular, because it promotes ideals of infallibility and absolute obedience that are not compatible with a secular worldview.  By definition, no totalitarian dictator can be rightly termed an atheist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;I'm normally rather careful with pronouns, to either say "he or she", or if I am writing informally, the singular "they".  However, I'm not aware of any female totalitarianist dictators, so I think I am safe in using the male pronoun here.  Correct me if I'm wrong!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5233181255779431896?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248465924444"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3543">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc49769994ed174a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="scams"/><category term="skepticism"/><category term="alternate reality"/><category term="ARG"/><category term="skep"/><category term="woo"/><title type="html">Making Life A Game</title><published>2009-07-24T19:42:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T19:42:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/24/making-life-a-game/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week my friend sent me a picture of a flyer he had seen on the street. It didn’t seem like much at first glance — just some hokum woo — but, on further investigation (because of course you have to investigate hokum woo!) it opened up a whole world of intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flyer was for the ‘Vital Orbit™’ Personal Human Force Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:385px"&gt;&lt;img title="The Vital Orbit " src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3556/3487381697_b9b1726ff6.jpg?v=0" alt="Personal Human Force Field - note that all the contact tags have been removed" width="375" height="500"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal Human Force Field - note that all the contact tags have been removed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;At first, I dismissed the picture, and wondered why my friends pick me to send things like this. But, then I started thinking about it a bit more, and I’ll admit my curiosity got the best of me. You can’t see it in this image, but there was a weblink on the flyer for the &lt;a title="Vital Orbit" href="http://www.jejuneinstitute.org/vital.htm"&gt;Jejune Institute and the Vital Orbit product&lt;/a&gt;. I checked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrases like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channels users own Hydrodynamic activities to project a spherical charge armament against all material bodies and organic compounds. Unintended matter undergoes total magnetic reversal (a process called “negativism”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vital-Orbit reduces these basic tenets to a demonstrable formula by harboring hydro-dynamics multiplied by intention (aquatic/thought). It is proven, time tested, bonafide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had me rolling on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there was more, I noticed. There was a whole website to explore. The products offered are all fabulously imagined devices to make life better, and the Founder… well, his “meet the founder” video is a piece of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Cmdv1kUxbJM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything about this Jejune Institute was simply too good to be true (what is with the 1972 – 2036 copyright? And, seriously… Jejune? The word means dull or insipid, or lacking in knowledge.). I wanted to know more, so I went to &lt;a title="Google search results" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=wyP&amp;amp;q=jejune+institute&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi=g6"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="YouTube search results" href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jejune+institute&amp;amp;search_type=&amp;amp;aq=0&amp;amp;oq=jejune"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Google, I found an interesting &lt;a title="IO9" href="http://io9.com/5105128/what-is-the-jejune-institute-and-why-are-they-recording-your-thoughts"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; describing the Jejune Institute as the doorway to an ARG, or alternate reality game, which use the real world as their platform. So, by following the clues laid out before you, you can head quite willingly down the rabbithole of surreal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the game was launched last October (2008), and from the looks of it has gone through a couple of iterations and gathered quite a cult following. There is one &lt;a title="Jejune Scavenger Hunt" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31067456@N07/"&gt;flickr photostream&lt;/a&gt; dated April 30, 2009 chronicling a fairly large gathering for some scavenger hunt aspect of the game. The institute even has a &lt;a title="Yelp - Jejune Institute" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/jejune-institute-san-francisco"&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following links, it all appears to be a well thought-out, intricate game. I guess the only way to determine the truth is to take the final step, and actually start playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My wife is chinese. So in our house, comfort food is often something chinese. For 
her, one of her very favorite things is dumplings, also known as pot-stickers. They're 
time consuming to make, but not difficult.  They're really delicious, well worth the effort.
They're best with a homemade wrapper, but that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; easy. If you go to a 
chinese grocery store, they sell pre-made dumpling wrappers with are pretty good. Not
as good as homemade, but more than adequate. The wrappers are circular, and about
2 or 3 inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; These are traditionally made with ground pork. But I don't eat pork, so I use chicken
thighs. Definitely make sure you use thighs - to come out right, the meat inside can't be
too lean - it needs to have some fat in it. Thighs work really nicely;  breasts, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; When my wife stuffs them, this recipe makes around 30 dumplings. If I'm
stuffing them, it's more like twice that - she somehow manages to stuff an amazing amount of
filling into each dumpling. If I try that, I can't close 'em.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 3 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1/2 medium sized head of napa cabbage (about 1lb).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Thinly sliced green parts of two scallions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1 tablespoon Oyster sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1-2 tablespoons say sauce (to taste)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A small dish of cold water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dumpling wrappers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instructions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Put the chicken thighs and the oyster sauce into a food processor. Pulse until
you've got what looks like coarsely ground meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Finely mince the cabbage. Don't do it in a food processor - that'll just
  pulp it. You want it minced into little pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Fold the cabbage, soy sauce, and sesame oil into the ground meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Now you've got the finished filling. Take a wrapper, put a dollop of filling
into the center of the wrapper. Lightly brush the edges with water, and then fold
the wrapper in half, sealing the edges. (The really correct way of doing it crimps
it so that it actually looks like a crescent moon, and stands up by itself. But I have
no idea how to explain that! And it tastes good even with the lazy fold.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Keep doing that until you run out of either wrappers or filling.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Heat up a shallow frying pan on medium to medium-high heat. Cover the bottom with oil. You want enough oil to fry &lt;em&gt;the bottom&lt;/em&gt; of the wrappers, but not enough that they're swimming in it. And you
only want the &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; to fry. (Don't use a wok for this. This is one of the only times
that I'll ever say that about chinese cooking - but you really want a flat bottomed pan.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Put the dumplings into the pan in shifts. You don't want them too close together, or they'll
stick to one another. Let them cook for one or two minutes, until the bottom is a nice dark brown.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Take about 1/2 cup of chicken stock, dump it into the pan, and &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; cover the pan
tightly. Let it cook like that until almost all of the stock evaporates. Then take the dumplings out,
and put them in a serving bowl. They'll stick to the bottom a bit; pry them up gently with either a 
spatula or tongs. (There's a reason that they're called pot-stickers!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Keep going in batches until they're all cooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Serve them with a dipping sauce. Spoon a bit of sauce over each dumpling right before
you eat it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There are a ton of dipping sauces you can use. My own favorite is:
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; about 1/4 cup of clear rice vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; About 1/4 cup of soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; 1 teaspoon of sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; one clove of crushed garlic, finely minced.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; One slice of ginger, crushed and finely minced.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Greens of one scallion finely minced.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; One drop of sesame oil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; One half teaspoon of sambal or sriracha chili sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; These little suckers are &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; good eating. They're sort of like potato chips, in that
once you start eating them, you can't stop. So make a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If you really want to make homemade wrappers (which is a lot of work, but
which makes these wonderful little things so much better that you'll never go back to store-made wrappers), there's a great recipe for them in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609605305?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0609605305"&gt;Ming Tsai's "Blue Ginger" cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0609605305" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/friday_recipe_chinese_potstick.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/l8f2l8BzQco" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248462199900"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8369">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72dc5c1bd27a982e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Kicking ass and taking names…</title><published>2009-07-24T19:00:31Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T19:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8369" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1beafebbab2576c2ae4319408c7858f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promise by next week, I’ll stop talking about marriage but this is something I’m curious about. When I got married, I decided to take my husband’s name. My maiden name was interesting and part of who I am, so I made it my middle name. I didn’t want to hyphenate because it would mean having a last name of 14 characters and nobody needs that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you think about the practice of a wife taking her husband’s name? Hyphenation? Keeping her maiden name? If this is a decision you’ve dealt with or are dealing with, what were/are your reasons? Any guys out there take their wives’ name?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I have been enjoying watching the chatter in the blogosphere who are &lt;i&gt;shocked&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/07/23/2009-07-23_obama_doesnt_regret_acted_stupidly_remark_compliments_sgt_james_crowley.html"&gt; arrest of Henry Gates &lt;/a&gt;on his own front porch despite his pleas to the police that he was trying to enter his own property after locking himself out.  Angry?  I get that.  Outraged?  I get that too.  But, &lt;i&gt;shocked&lt;/i&gt;?  Are people really that shocked at a story of a man of color being arrested as he tried to get into his own house? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;shock&lt;/i&gt; in the blogosphere kind of reminded me of this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/hO6oNlierSQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video 1: Beginning at about minute 1:20.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Surely a police officer &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/07/23/2009-07-23_sgt_james_crowley_cop_who_arrested_henry_louis_gates_denies_hes_a_racist.html"&gt;who teaches racial profiling at the local police academy &lt;/a&gt;didn't arrest Professor Gates because he's black.  After all, he says he's not a racist.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't a man's word good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

I've blogged about the ADA a fair amount, some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_6_of_6_ada_sections_ii_and_iii"&gt;positive&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_dark_side_of_the_ada"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt;, and plenty just &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=ada+raymaker"&gt;in passing or reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the only person who has mixed feelings about this legislation which has been both a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_6_of_6_ada_sections_ii_and_iii"&gt;powerful tool for equality&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_5_of_6_ada-aa_whyfor_in_employment"&gt;nasty disappointment&lt;/a&gt; for people seeking justice.  Lower Hudson Journal News contributor Robert Cole asks whether &lt;a href="http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009907120310"&gt;a get well card would be more appropriate for the ADA&lt;/a&gt; than a birthday card.  Cole sites little change in employment rates, continued lack of access, and continued lack of community inclusion as deep issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_5_of_6_ada-aa_whyfor_in_employment"&gt;issues with the ADA itself&lt;/a&gt; that need to be rectified, but do those issues account solely for Cole's observations?  What role might other factors such as lack of program coordination, conflicting policies, and program disincentives (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_two_faces_of_government_programs"&gt;National Disability Policy: A Progress Report&lt;/a&gt; document for more ideas) play in the bigger picture?  What about situations where the government is refusing to work on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/class_vs_cca"&gt;the infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; necessary for the ADA to be fully realized?  What &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stereotypes_about_not_working"&gt;other complex factors&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/transportation_addendum_to_stereotypes_about_not_working"&gt;intricacies of transportation&lt;/a&gt;, that often aren't thought about?  What about the sort of discrimination few see because it is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/culturally_sanctioned_stigma_as_academic_bias"&gt;culturally sanctioned&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Cole states, we have to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where is the leverage for doing better?  Is it in the ADA itself, or elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think, should the ADA get the birthday card, the get well card, or both?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248458871857"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14169">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3fa23826052df71f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">One Christian Calls Out the Others for Being Hypocrites on the Gay Marriage Issue… Then Screws It All Up</title><published>2009-07-24T18:00:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T18:00:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/24/one-christian-calls-out-the-others-for-being-hypocrites-on-the-gay-marriage-issue-then-screws-it-all-up/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s an article in &lt;em&gt;Christianity Today&lt;/em&gt; by senior managing editor &lt;strong&gt;Mark Galli&lt;/strong&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=84210"&gt;“Is the Gay Marriage Debate Over?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too hard to pick apart much of what he says, beginning with the very first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he does make a very powerful statement to his fellow Christians, one that I rarely hear coming from the mouth (typing hands?) of an evangelical Christian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We cannot very well argue for the sanctity of marriage as a crucial social institution while we blithely go about divorcing and approving of remarriage at a rate that destabilizes marriage. We cannot say that an institution, like the state, has a perfect right to insist on certain values and behavior from its citizens while we refuse to submit to denominational or local church authority. We cannot tell gay couples that marriage is about something much larger than self-fulfillment when we, like the rest of heterosexual culture, delay marriage until we can experience life, and delay having children until we can enjoy each other for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we have been perfect hypocrites on this issue. Until we admit that, and take steps to amend our ways, our cries of alarm about gay marriage will echo off into oblivion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in typical conservative Christian fashion, he can’t possibly leave it at that… so he screws up the argument with the next paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This does not mean we should stop fighting initiatives that would legalize gay marriage. Gay marriage is simply a bad idea, whether one is religious or not. But it’s bad not only because of what it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; do to the social fabric, but because of what it signals &lt;em&gt;has already happened&lt;/em&gt; to our social fabric. We are a culture of radical individualists, and gay marriage does nothing but put an exclamation point on that fact. We should fight it, because it will only make a bad situation worse.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Christians and gays are both responsible for the downfall of our society… so let’s stop changing our Christian ways and continue denying gay people their right to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is another testament to the fact that Christians have no solid reasons to deny gay marriage other than their religiously-inspired homophobia.&lt;br&gt;

Jennifer Ouellette is a science writer, blogger, smart chick, and head of the Science and Entertainment Exchange (SEE), a high-level effort to get more science into movies. She also spoke at TAM 7 last week, where we threw her on a panel with Penn &amp;amp; Teller, My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™, and Bill Prady (co-executive producer of &amp;quot;The Big Bang Theory&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/twisted_physics/2009/07/in-praise-of-insignificance.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/jennifer_ouellette.jpg" alt="Jennifer Ouellette head shot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was concerned about her impact in such a high-powered panel, but I think she was awesome. She has an ability to take personal anecdotes and extrapolate them to the bigger picture, and do it in a charming and meaningful way. And, just to prove it in meta fashion, she took that panel experience &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/twisted_physics/2009/07/in-praise-of-insignificance.html"&gt;and wrote an excellent blog post&lt;/a&gt; about significance and insignificance in the Universe.

&lt;p&gt;I was raised by my grandmother, a 4′9″ lady who wore gloves when she drove to keep her hands from getting suntanned. Her cocktail parties were pure Mad Men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind this tiny, delicate, lady-like exterior, she was a Darwin-thumping atheist and the most logical person I have ever met. One who marched against the draft for WWII, worked to bring non-fiction into libraries and spoke her mind with gleeful disregard for propriety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one party, my Catholic great aunt said “Barbara, I don’t understand how you can live without God in your life.” Grandmother patted her on the knee in a friendly fashion and said “That’s because you’re an idiot, dear.” And they both laughed because it was an ongoing discussion within their group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is difficult for me to see skepticism as a current trend. Rather it seems to have leapt a generation and is now coming back into popularity as an interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one was at a social gathering with many strangers and started a conversation about ghost debunking, moon-landing conspiracies, or any of the more pop-skeptic topics, the results would be immediate and gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little luck, you might even get an idiot there to feed you the straight lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could use this:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is racial bias ever a factor in police work?  Was racial bias a factor in GatesGate, the recent incident in Cambridge Massachusetts involving Harvard scholar Skip Gates and the Cambridge Police? Here, I want to relate an incident in which I was involved in which a very strong racial bias clearly occurred, in which the police tried to arrest a black man principally because he was black even though he was totally innocent, and at the same time, gave undue sway to a white man.  First a little context, then the parable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the facts emerge it becomes clear that Skip Gates was unlawfully arrested by the Cambridge Police, and that while this may not have exactly been a &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2009/07/is-hate-crime.html"&gt;hate crime&lt;/a&gt;, there is a reasonably good chance that racial bias was involved.  I have a feeling that Skip Gates himself would be the first to point out that this is not the worst thing that has ever happened to anyone, there are much worse cases where racia bias ultimately victimizes a person of color.  I assure you that on the same evening dozens, nay, hundreds, of equally black men very much in their own homes were also busted by racist white police officers at various locations across this country, and they didn't do anything either.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was the arrest unlawful?  Well, technically, it was not, but he was arrested under a widely used type of statute that is designed to keep the peace but is in fact used by the police to directly punish people who give them lip.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, race is a factor in this case, which is in part why we are talking about it here.  The very validity of the concept of race itself &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/08/the_gene_for_running_fast_or_f.php"&gt;can and should be questioned&lt;/a&gt;, and despite modest efforts of educating the public (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/10/the_science_museum_of_minnesot.php"&gt;like this exhibit&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/insisting_that_races_are_real.php"&gt;questionable social model of biological race&lt;/a&gt; persists in Western society.  (See &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/11/the_scientific_political_socia.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/10/the_nature_of_the_racist_conve.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.)  Racism is at the root of well known horrific &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/08/mississippi_burning.php"&gt;historical events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/02/charles-and-willie/"&gt;singular murderous acts&lt;/a&gt;.  Racial bias &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/06/class_action_status_for_race_d.php"&gt;affects people's jobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/06/chronic_racial_discrimination.php"&gt;people's health&lt;/a&gt;, and increased a person's chance of being in prison if their skin is not white.  Racialized thinking and racism can be very &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2008/08/when_the_big_cat_eats_the_blac.php"&gt;bad for the health of those with subaltern status&lt;/a&gt; (usually that means "non white").  Racialized thinking and racial bias can lead to unabashedly &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31050599/"&gt;bald faced blaming&lt;/a&gt;, to absurd &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/06/walter_cronkite.php"&gt;fear-based bias &lt;/a&gt;amongst members of the same, upper class, to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/06/white_supremacist_shoots_guard.php"&gt;outrageous acts of senseless violence&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/04/ultimate_racism_the_liberation.php"&gt;deeply insulting political decisions&lt;/a&gt;.  Despite a lack of research, there is evidence that &lt;a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w6784.pdf"&gt;race plays a role in policing&lt;/a&gt; from the police (staffing)  end of things.  &lt;a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=driving+while+black"&gt;Driving while black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ccj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/3/345"&gt;shopping while black&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently being in your house while black, are representitive outcomes of a racialized society.  &lt;a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=police+racial+profiling"&gt;Racial profile and policing&lt;/a&gt; can go hand in hand.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will all get sorted out and there are already strong indications from Cambridge that the ultimate outcome of Gatesgate will be a positive and forward moving learning experience for all.  So, while that is happening, let me tell you my story about black and white and the Cambridge Police.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/cambridge_police_a_matter_of_b.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/cambridge_police_a_matter_of_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/B5uOpluQKP8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248458447158"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/what_are_hate_crimes_and_shoul.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd7e19fb52752246</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospherics"/><title type="html">What are hate crimes, and should there be a law against them?</title><published>2009-07-24T17:20:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T17:20:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/yrfJnuly8lI/what_are_hate_crimes_and_shoul.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/what_are_hate_crimes_and_shoul.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of objections that have been raised to proposed US hate crime legislation are nothing more than politically motivated (and hateful) knee-jerk reactions by yahooistic wing&lt;em&gt;nuts&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Science is everywhere, and there’s no need to be stuffy about it.  One of the best ways to communicate the excitement that we feel about science to a much wider audience is to connect it to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/18/seex/"&gt;popular culture&lt;/a&gt; in all sorts of ways — whether it’s &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/12/26/the-physics-of-imaginary-things/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/02/the-numbers-behind-numb3rs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NUMB3RS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/04/a-teaching-moment-angels-demons/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lostuniversity.org/index.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/lostuniversity.jpg" align="right" alt="LOST University"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; So it’s great to see the producers of ABC’s hit TV show &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LOST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; jump on the bandwagon.  This fall they will be releasing the DVD collection of the fifth season, and the Blu-ray edition is going to feature a special treat:  mini-”lessons” on various academic subjects related to the show.  (The final season of the show begins early in 2010.)  One of those subjects is time travel, and you have a pretty esteemed group of professors guiding you through this fascinating subject:  &lt;a href="http://physics.usc.edu/Faculty/Warner/"&gt;Nick Warner&lt;/a&gt; of USC (who taught me general relativity back in the day), our old friend &lt;a href="http://asymptotia.com/"&gt;Clifford Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, and myself.  Suffice it to say, I’ve seen the rough cut, and they did a good job — and we had quite a bit of fun.  I was only included because having all the professors speak with British accents would have seemed a bit posh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And along with that, they’ve just launched an associated website:  &lt;a href="http://www.lostuniversity.org/index.php"&gt;LOST University&lt;/a&gt;.  You can see what the other courses in the curriculum are going to be, including Philosophy and Foreign Languages.  At the moment the website is essentially promotion for the DVD’s themselves, but I’m hoping more content will appear over time.  LOST has a tradition of enhancing the show with quite elaborate online activities, in the form of &lt;a href="http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/ARG"&gt;alternate reality games&lt;/a&gt;.  So hopefully this new site won’t simply be an advertisement — one of the lessons of new media is that giving away cool stuff for free makes it more likely that people will pay money for the even cooler stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear:  the science of time travel on LOST does not necessarily &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/05/14/rules-for-time-travelers/"&gt;obey all the rules&lt;/a&gt;.  None of us had anything to do with the show itself, and I have no idea what the writers did in terms of seeking science advice.  But understanding how the rules are broken can serve as fodder for teaching moments just as easily as seeing them obeyed.  That’s life here “on the cutting edge of tomorrow.”  &lt;/p&gt;

The quacks are cheering him on, too — every naturopath, homeopath, acupuncturist, crystal healer, shaman, meditator, and iridologist wants their slice of that great big health insurance pie. It&amp;#39;s a disgrace. Strangely, the insurance companies aren&amp;#39;t complaining. This comment explains that, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey Kaltsas, president emeritus of the American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, said the country could save billions of dollars by shifting care for a number of conditions away from pharmaceutical treatment and toward acupuncture. Kaltsas said the number of licensed practitioners has grown to 20,000 from just 300 in 1971, indicating that many people are sold on the practice's effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that last word should be stricken out and replaced with the more appropriate term, "profitability".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country could also save billions of dollars if, instead of treating cancer with chemotherapy and surgery and all those expensive Big Medicine remedies, they instead used my personal tickle therapy cure — the only expenses are the cost of feathers and my personal time, at $500 an hour. It is so much cheaper than those overpriced medicines! And instead of putting the patient in a state that requires months or years of sustained expense, and years and years of regular doctor&amp;#39;s visits and diagnostic examinations, my therapy is fast — depending on how far the cancer had progressed, I only need to be employed for weeks or months…and then no more medical expenses at all. Ever. I can guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurance companies should love me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/please_stop_electing_fool_hark.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DHl0oEzvvYw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248454434796"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14158">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7313f9a21b12d046</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Bus Ads"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">A Simple Atheist Bus Ad Gets Lots of Publicity</title><published>2009-07-24T16:00:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T16:00:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/24/a-simple-atheist-bus-ad-gets-lots-of-publicity/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nyc-atheists.org/"&gt;New York City Atheists&lt;/a&gt; have had this ad running on Manhattan buses for the past month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nyc-atheists.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/bus-poster.gif" alt="bus-poster" title="bus-poster" width="500" height="239"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the ad because if you get offended by it, then really, you’re the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicity continues with &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/nyregion/24nyc.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clyde Haberman&lt;/strong&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The message, in white lettering on a sky-blue background, is nonconfrontational by design. It doesn’t attack religion or say there is no God. It simply says: “You don’t have to believe in God to be a moral or ethical person.” Hard to gainsay that thought. Most of us know nonbelievers who are pillars of rectitude. We also know pious types who are as honest as a Siberian winter’s day is long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… the poor economy has been something of a blessing for the nonbelievers. “We probably could not have gotten this poster program in New York City if the financial times were very good,” said Mr. Bronstein, who is 70 and retired from I.B.M. “But people are looking for business.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also highlights the most important part of the worldwide atheist bus campaign: It’s not about tearing down religion.  It’s about showing closeted atheists that they are not alone.  It’s about getting atheists to be open and proud of their non-belief in a god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep the ads coming.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three historians of science are unhappy about their treatment in a creationist movie about Darwin, as they explain in a note in the July 2009 Newsletter of the History of Science Society. Peter Bowler, Janet Browne, and Sandra Herbert write, "We have recently been featured in a documentary film, 'The Voyage that Shook the World,' produced by Fathom Media of Australia and directed by Stephen Murray of Synergy Films, New Zealand. We were led to believe that the movie was being made to be shown as an educational film on Australian broadcast television and possibly elsewhere.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;World’s most powerful supercomputer becomes operational&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article continued with this detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world’s fastest and most powerful supercomputer, named Novo-G, has become operational at the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love super-computers and I always celebrate in my own way the crowning of a new super computer king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when they graduate from one thousandfold number crunching realm to another. Last year, IBM’s &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9095279/All_hail_Roadrunner_s_petaflop_record_now_what_about_the_exaflop_"&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/a&gt; system did this when it was the first official computer to break through the the teraflop barrier into the domain of &lt;a href="http://isp.webopedia.com/TERM/P/petaflop.html"&gt;petaflops&lt;/a&gt;. This means that Roadrunner can make more than one quadrillion calculations per second allowing it to tackle previously unassailable physics problems and to more realistically simulate fiendishly complicated systems like the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually it takes a while for a completely different supercomputer to leap-frog a new  champion, but hey, what the hell, the sooner the better in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is…Novo-G is not the “fastest and most powerful super-computer”. So what’s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the author read that the Novo-G was ” the most powerful computer of its kind” and kind-of forgot to dig deeper on the “of its kind” bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This computer is the probably the most powerful Reconfigurable Computer in the world but that’s a far cry from what Roadrunner can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of this writer’s error, this is a nice advance and it could bode well for the future of reconfigurable computers. These computers can actually change the way their circuits are arranged on the fly in order to optimize it’s speed and power consumption for any given task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of computer is a best-of-both-worlds approach to computing. Your PC is very flexible but it pays the price with slow performance and a lot of overhead in terms of space and energy. Special-purpose computers (like super-computers) are designed to perform specific tasks extremely well but they are not flexible at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Vernon Middle School science teacher John Freshwater was scheduled to resume today, July 24.  However, after an hour-long conference this morning among the attorneys and referee, the hearing did not resume and will not resume until sometime on or after September 10, 2009.  It seems that the Ohio Revised Code provides that in such a hearing, the subject of the hearing, in this case Freshwater, can elect to not have hearing days scheduled when the schools are not in session, and through his attorney, R. Kelly Hamilton, that choice was made today.  In interviews after the aborted hearing Hamilton made it clear that it was his decision as Freshwater’s attorney, not Freshwater’s.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton said he intends to file a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus" rel="external "&gt;writ of mandamus&lt;/a&gt; with the Ohio Supreme Court to compel the Board to issue subpoenas for two Board of Education members, Jody Goetzman and Ian Watson, to testify.  He had previously requested that they be subpoenaed, but the Board of Education (the issuing body for subpoenas for the hearing) quashed the subpoenas and the Knox County Court of Common Pleas declined to enforce the (non-existent because they were quashed) subpoenas.  See &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/freshwater-upda.html" rel=""&gt;here for that story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A writ of mandamus is a high priority item for the State Supreme Court – it goes to the head of the queue on the Court’s docket – but the Court is on summer recess now so it’s hard to know when the Court will rule on Hamilton’s motion, which is not yet filed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More below the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s of some interest that Hamilton informed the hearing referee of his intention to delay the hearing on Tuesday of this week, but it was not acted on until this morning after a bunch of attorneys, a prospective witness, and a (very small) gallery of spectators and media had assembled in the hearing room this morning.  That it was a last-minute affair is consistent with Hamilton’s apparent strategy to delay, delay, and delay some more in order to bring pressure on the Board of Education to settle on Freshwater’s terms.  Hamilton mentioned his intention to appeal the Common Pleas Court’s ruling two weeks ago on July 11, 2009, in &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/marion_delgado/Freshwater_Burney_ALL.txt" rel="external "&gt;a radio interview&lt;/a&gt;.  So there was no need to bring all these attorneys to Mt. Vernon this morning only to announce that Freshwater would choose to postpone it until September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the radio interview linked above Don Matolyak, Freshwater’s pastor, complained about the cost of the hearing to the school district and the hours that Freshwater’s attorney has put in, explictly coupling the latter with comments about Freshwater’s terms for a settlement.  In my view, Freshwater and his attorney have been a primary cause of that cost.  Just this morning five attorneys spent billable hours because Hamilton delayed the request to postpone the hearing until the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comments after the postponement, David Millstone, the Board of Education’s attorney, said that he wouldn’t speculate on Hamilton’s motives for requesting the postponement, but that the Board was eager to conclude the hearing expeditiously and regretted the delay.  He said that calling the Board members to testify was inappropriate because they have no first-hand knowledge of the matters that are the subject of the hearing, Freshwater’s behavior in a variety of school contexts.  He said also that the Board members will have to make a decision on the referee’s recommendation.  They initiated the process that will lead (sometime this decade, I hope!) to a recommendation from the referee and will then have to act on the recommendation.  However, they were not themselves parties to or observers of the acts that led to the initiation of termination proceedings and hence their testimony is inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Freshwater (and/or Hamilton) has a conspiracy theory to the effect that his 2003 effort to introduce Jonathan Wells’ crap into the school science curriculum put a target on him, “branded” him, in his own words in the interview linked above.  Apparently someone – the Board, the administration, someone – has held a grudge against him for that, and the termination proceedings six years later are the result of that grudge.  It’s of some interest that there are only two people in authority in the school during his termination proceedings who were also in their positions during the 2003 incident.  They are Lynda Weston, who was Director of Teaching and Learning from 2000 to 2008, when she retired, and &lt;a href="http://www.mvnu.edu/facstaff/professors/NatScience/mbennett.asp" rel="external "&gt;Dr. Margie Bennett&lt;/a&gt;, an administrator at the Mt. Vernon Nazarene University and the only Board member during the 2003 incident who is still on the Board now.  So if Freshwater is right and administrators and Board members have been conspiring since 2003 to get rid of him, it’s Weston and Bennett who must be the culprits.  I don’t think John has thought this through very carefully.  Bennett in particular has taken significant pressure from her co-religionists in this matter both in 2003 and now, and I admire her ability to think about her responsibilities to the schools in spite of that pressure.  She has done a good job for the schools for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major influences that combined to form Western psychedelic rock was traditional Asian music. But musicians in Asia picked up the vibe pretty quickly and started to play their own versions of it. Lately I've been listening to a great compilation of the stuff, and I'm particularly struck by the 1975 track "Gönül Sabreyle Sabreyle" (&lt;a href="http://www.imeem.com/gkhnksc/music/1ockzhpp/uc-hurel-sabreyle-sabreyle/"&gt;hear it streamed here&lt;/a&gt;). The band playing it is the brother trio &lt;a href="http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_H%C3%BCrel"&gt;Üç Hürel&lt;/a&gt;, "The Three Hürels", &lt;del&gt;and the song's title would in English be something like "Oh Sabreyle, my heart, Sabreyle"&lt;/del&gt;. &lt;a href="http://progressive.homestead.com/3_HUEREL.html"&gt;Reading up&lt;/a&gt; about the band on the web, I've learned that the Hürel brothers released only two albums before disbanding for decades, and that this track is on the second, more Western-styled one: &lt;i&gt;Hürel Arsivi&lt;/i&gt; (1976). Calling them an Asian band isn't strictly correct though, as they're from Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/awesome_turkish_70s_psychedeli/ferdinun_h_rel.jpg" width="233" height="197" alt="ferdinun_h_rel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The musicianship is great: just listen to the darbouka drum fills. Awesome. And youngest brother Feridun Hürel not only sings his heart out &lt;del&gt;for the apparently cruel and unyielding or otherwise unavailable Sabreyle&lt;/del&gt;, he also plays the fuzz guitar solo &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the electrified &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%9Flama"&gt;saz&lt;/a&gt; solo on the same two-necked instrument, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; wrote the song. Talented guy! The song's clearly a classic in Turkey: poking around I've found a number of covers, ranging from overdecorated 80s metal versions to a grizzled guy alone with a saz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried machine-translating the &lt;a href="http://www.gitarakor.com/sarki-sozleri-487521/uc_hurel/gonul_sabreyle_sabreyle.htm"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;, but I couldn't get them to make much sense ("Assortment eating does not always go", errr...). I'd be much obliged if somebody with the necessary language skills would translate them. Myself, I pretty much only know the Turkish word for "sausage".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update same day:&lt;/b&gt; Dear Reader Samarkeolog of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://human-rights-archaeology.blogspot.com/"&gt;Human Rights Archaeology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; came through with a translation! Turns out "sabreyle" is not the name of some dark-eyed Bosporanean wench after all.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every winter has a spring&lt;br&gt;
Every night has a morning&lt;br&gt;
Enough now leave&lt;br&gt;
The heart with a sword&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every rise has a fall&lt;br&gt;

The heart with a sword&lt;/p&gt;

First, there is an &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JD011637.shtml"&gt;atrocious paper&lt;/a&gt; that has just been published in JGR by McLean, de Freitas and Carter that is doing the rounds of the denialosphere. These authors make the completely unsurprising point that that there is a correlation between ENSO indices and global mean temperature – something that has been well known for decades – and then go on to claim that that all trends are explained by this correlation as well. This is somewhat surprising since their method of analysis (which involves taking the first derivative of any changes) &lt;em&gt;eliminates&lt;/em&gt; the influence of any trends in the correlation. Tamino has an &lt;a href="http://tamino.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/old-news/"&gt;excellent demonstration&lt;/a&gt; of the fatuity of the statements in their hyped press-release and &lt;a href="http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2009/07/surprising-conclusions-from.html"&gt;Michael Tobis&lt;/a&gt; deconstructs the details. For reference, we showed last year that the long term trends are still basically the same after you &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/07/global-trends-and-enso/"&gt;account for ENSO&lt;/a&gt;. Nevermore let it be said that you can’t get any old rubbish published in a peer-reviewed journal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second (and much more interestingly) there is an open call for anyone interested to contribute to setting the agenda for Earth System Science for the next couple of decades at the &lt;a href="http://visioning.icsu.org/"&gt;Visioning Earth Science&lt;/a&gt; website of the International Council for Science (ICS). This is one of the umbrella organisations that runs a network of committees and programs that prioritise research directions and international programs and they are looking for ideas.

I expected some blowback for my criticism, and I got some. However, I was surprised at how mild it was, at least from the one person I expected to defend the decision, P.Z. Myers. Quite frankly, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/put_maher_in_the_hot_seat.php"&gt;his defense of&lt;/a&gt; the decision to select Bill Maher struck me as enormously half-hearted, in essence saying, "Sure he's a wingnut, but he's &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; wingnut, and, oh, by the way, all that quackery he supports has nothing to do with the award anyway because he made a movie atheists like. So stop harshing our buzz at getting to have a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; celebrity well known in the mainstream address the convention." It wasn't really worth a whole post to respond to (just one an aside in one of my characteristically long-winded non sequiturs of an introduction), because P.Z. struck me as being rather embarrassed at having to defend the choice of Maher. That such a tepid defense of the choice of Maher was the best that P.Z. could come up with told me pretty much all I need to know about how crappy the choice of Maher was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus endeth the non-related introduction to this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, I realized that I hadn't done &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt; in over a month, and I needed a fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So searching through my infamous Folder of Woo, along with some more recent candidates for a a discussion, I noticed that a lot of them were fairly old. I guess that's what I get for farting around so much about doing YFDoW on such an irregular basis. I noticed one thing fairly quickly. I've been doing this little flight of fancy for three years now, less frequently in the last year, and I don't think that I've ever found any really good woo for pets. Oh, sure, I've found the occasional pet acupuncture site, but they've never been anything all that woo-ey. Ditto the occasional pet herbal remedy site. But then, I hadn't really looked--until now.&lt;/p&gt;

Just a heads-up for me droogs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are attending Comic Con, I’ll be signing copies of my book &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href="http://mysteriousgalaxy.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents"&gt;the Mysterious Galaxy booth&lt;/a&gt; (#1119) on Friday, July 24 (today!) from 6:00 to 6:50 p.m. I’ll note that they have advance copies of the new paperback edition of the book! I hadn’t even known the paperback version would be ready by now, so I’m very excited to see it! This is your first chance to get a look, and the only one for some time; the paperback won’t go to mass market for a few more months. This is a Comic Con special, so grab ‘em while you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t be carrying around copies of the book, so the only way you can get ‘em AFAIK is there. If you happen to buy one and see me later, I’ll be happy to sign it whenever, of course — unless I’m talking to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Torv"&gt;Anna Torv&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/02/mysteries-of-the-cosmos/"&gt;Brea Grant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see me talking to them, then &lt;em&gt;by all means&lt;/em&gt; come up and ask. Can’t hurt my cred.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248445442856"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=590">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b30ec314d4e10f2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="calories"/><category term="dieting"/><title type="html">Calories Revisited</title><published>2009-07-24T13:54:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T13:54:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=590" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a proponent of the notion that the dominant factor in determining weight gain or loss is the formula – calories in vs calorie out. In fact, this formula is inescapable – change in weight must be equal to the total calories consumed minus the total calories burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I write about this topic, however, angry critics (food is always highly emotional) charge that this formula is not true because it is too simplistic. But I think they misunderstand the formula. For example, some argue that this formula does not necessarily explain the differences among people. This is partly correct, but irrelevant. It does largely explain the difference – overweight and obesity does in fact correlate with higher caloric intake, and all weight loss diets work by reducing calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, people are different – they have different digestive systems and different metabolisms. They have different amounts of brown fat – the kind of fat that burns calories to generate heat. Therefore, some people burn more calories while sitting and watching tv than other people, and they are more likely to be thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at present there is no safe and effective way to change people’s metabolisms. Without going into detail, I do not think that stimulants are a safe way to achieve this. And drugs to block food absorption have been pulled from the market due to side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while metabolism may explain why person A is thin and person B is overweight, if person B wants to become thin they need to either decrease their caloric intake and/or increase their caloric expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And keep in mind that the evidence suggests that most people who are overweight are so not because they are victims of their genetics, but because of their lifestyle. This is actually a good thing – because we can change our lifestyle.  (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090325162634.htm"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; shows that the morbidly obese are sedentary 99% of the time.  &lt;a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/AmberWaves/November05/Findings/USFoodConsumption.htm"&gt;Data shows &lt;/a&gt;that per capita food consumption is up 16% in the US since 1970. – just to give a couple examples. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest and most effective ways of altering behavior to consume fewer calories is &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Fitness/Story?id=5327486&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;keeping a food diary&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, anything that makes us pay attention to how much food we are eating is likely to decrease how much food we are eating – which is probably why most diets work in the short term. It also makes sense that we should pay attention to the caloric density of the food we eat – an apple may be about the same volume as a slice of cheesecake, but their caloric content is not the same. We need some way to estimate the amount of calories that we consume, so that we do not accidentally over eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327171.200-the-calorie-delusion-why-food-labels-are-wrong.html?full=true"&gt;article in the NewScientist&lt;/a&gt; points out that one barrier to accurate calorie estimating is that the number of calories reported on various food items may be misleading. Food calories are calculated using the Atwater system, which assumes that our body burning food for energy is literally equivalent to incinerating the food and measuring the heat produced. I remember seeing this on a “Mister Science” type show when I was a kid – burning a pile of jelly donuts and saying that the energy released is the same as if we ate the jelly donuts. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a catch – processing, digesting and absorbing nutrients from food costs calories, and some of the calories in food are consumed by the bacteria in our guts or excreted as waste. Therefore what we really want to know about the food we eat is not how many calories are in the food but how many calories we will net from eating it. If a piece of food has 100 calories, but it costs 20 calories to extract that energy, and 10 calories are lost to bacteria and stool, then we are only netting 70 calories from that piece of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all food were 70% efficient then this would not be a big deal – in fact lowering the number of calories reported on food labels may contribute to more overeating.  But the real issue is that different foods have significantly different efficiencies. Soft foods are easier to consume than hard foods. Cooked foods are easier to digest than raw foods. Cooking food actually gave a huge boost to human evolution because our ancestors could extract many more calories and nutrients from their food, and expand the number of foods they could eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking is interesting because we are literally using energy from fire to replace energy we would have to expend in digestion, and we can get more energy from the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differences in food calorie efficiency can range from 5-25%. Some argue that food labeling should reflect this – not just the total Atwater calories. Therefore we would be better able to estimate our caloric intake. At present people may falsely assume that soft and easily digested food is equivalent to mechanically hard and fibrous food of the same calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences between total and effective calories may also explain why highly processed food seems to be associated with being overweight. Processed food is not necessarily bad for you – it is just highly efficient. Finely milled wheat is more efficient than whole grain. Chopped or processed meat is more efficient than whole meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiency was a good thing when we were scraping out a living in the wild. It is also a good thing in those parts of the developing world where hunger and starvation are a problem. But in the affluent West – we are victims of our own efficiency. If you want to lose weight, you want to be caloricly inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one realization about effective calories vs Atwater calories is not going to solve our obesity problem. But each little bit helps. I maintain that the weight loss industry has been largely counterproductive – promising easy solutions and distracting people from the real issue. For any individual hoping to maintain a slimmer and more healthy weight, keep it simple. Find a fun exercise you can do on a regular basis. And keep some basic track of your effective calorie intake and keep it under control.&lt;/p&gt;

The reason? Fishermen can sell a single bluefin for $173,000. At first thought, you might feel like blaming the greedy fishermen (and I think there is some fault there), but here's an &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/hivemind/2009/07/24/frank-bruni-rich-aholes-and-bluefin-tuna-as-gucci-handbag/"&gt;article that assigns the blame more appropriately&lt;/a&gt;: fault the rich assholes who regard paying an obscene price for a small bite to be part of the cachet of the fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People believe in their hearts that a piece of raw fish is worth $600. And one of the main reasons that it's worth $600 is because you can't afford it and I can't, but they can. That makes it very special, and it makes people who eat it special.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Any kind of luxury goods largely come from that sort of statement: I can afford it, and you can't. I'll drive a Maserati, even if I can't drive it faster than 65 miles per hour in most of the United States. I can afford a $280,000 car, and you're stuck with a Dodge Neon. I can fly private jet, drive a Maserati, do anything I bloody well please, including having a $600 piece of fish. And you can't."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And this is the brutal truth: bluefin, which beyond their intrinsic value as living creatures happen to be one of the universe&amp;#39;s more majestic species, a Platonic ideal of oceanic speed and grace, aren&amp;#39;t being extinguished by our greed. They&amp;#39;re being sacrificed to our vanity, pretension, and ostentation — the most pathetic of our vices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep that in mind, rich assholes of the world. When you throw down huge amounts of cash for luxury items, the rest of us aren't watching you admiringly. We think you're vain and pretentious and, well, revolting, in the most pathetic sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/destroying_beauty_because_you.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/S4wnlRMqL3k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248444923502"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/kooks_dont_need_evidence.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/232a98083054992a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Kooks don't need evidence</title><published>2009-07-24T13:50:34Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T13:50:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/c6vVrx6P7G8/kooks_dont_need_evidence.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/kooks_dont_need_evidence.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I mentioned the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/oh_no_ill_never_be_able_to_moc.php"&gt;silly anti-global-warming argument of Alan Quist&lt;/a&gt;: he claims a 16th century map shows Antarctica in accurate detail, revealing that 500 years, the continent was completely ice-free.

(There are several dozen species of toucans in five genera, all Central or South American.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next most obvious hypothesis is diet: maybe toucans eat a type of food that requires large bills to handle.  But that doesn’t seem likely, either.  Toucans are frugivores (fruit eaters; Fig. 3), and there’s no obvious reason why they need such a big bill to handle fruit.  Indeed, there are many frugivorous birds, like parrots, and none of the others have such hypertrophied beaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5939/468"&gt;A paper in today’s &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives a clue: the bill is a radiator. You might suspect this because the bill is full of small blood vessels and is uninsulated. But can the birds control the flow of blood to the bill as needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors used thermal-imaging video cameras to record the temperature of the birds’ bills and bodies in rooms adjusted to different temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 34 degrees C (the species was the toco toucan, &lt;em&gt;Ramphastos toco&lt;/em&gt;, which has the largest bill of all toucans).  What the authors found, and what you can see in the movies below, is that the toucan can adjust blood flow to the bill depending on ambient temperature.  When the room heats up, the surface of the bill heats up rapidly, allowing body heat to be dumped.  The reverse happens at cooler temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When birds are flying — a time when they produce 10 to 12 times more metabolic heat than when they are resting — the bills can heat up by as much as 6 degrees Centigrade.  And when the birds get ready to sleep, a time when their body temperature is reduced (this saves metabolic energy), the surface of the bill transiently heats up, allowing them to dump heat (see movie #1 below).  There are also, as you can see in movie #2, transient changes in bill temperature &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; sleep, presumably to regulate body temperature (like many birds, the toucan tucks its bill under its feathers while asleep, presumably also to buffer heat loss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol325/issue5939/images/data/468/DC1/1175553s1.mpg"&gt;Movie 1&lt;/a&gt;.  Body heat moves to the bill right before the bird goes to sleep (note bill glowing bright orange, while body stays darker; temperature scale to right). “Heat dumping to the bill during entry into sleep. Thermal imaging video demonstrating transient movement of body heat to the bill during initiation of sleep in a toco toucan. Time-lapsed data obtained at 10-s intervals.

&lt;p&gt;Now none of this answers the question of why the beaks are often brightly colored.  That probably has the same answer to the question of why some other non-dimorphic birds, like parrots, are also brightly colored.  There are lots of theories (ease of recognizing members of your own species is one), but, in short, we don’t know why.  And we also don’t know why toucans, but no other species, have beaks this large.  Why do toucans need to thermoregulate more than other species? A final question — one that probably can’t be answered — is this: did natural selection increase bill size because that increase directly helped with thermoregulation, or is the thermoregulatory function an &lt;em&gt;exaptation&lt;/em&gt;, a beneficial byproduct of a feature selected for some other reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; I am not a style doctor or writing adviser, and (unlike Strunk and White) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I don't think everyone should write like me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;. My interest here is solely in the fact that we need an explanation for the fact that educated Americans today have scarcely any clue what "passive clause" means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; [emphasis added] &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, on July 21, (someone going by the name of) David Walker happened on this post and added a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1485#comment-37702"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; "I don't think everyone should write like me." Me? Is that correct? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer, of course, is "yes". But if you were interested in short answers, you wouldn't be reading Language Log. So after the jump, you'll find a longer one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mr. Walker represents (or gives a fine imitation of) the "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1357"&gt;nervous cluelessness&lt;/a&gt;" that modern grammar teaching generates in its victims. He's uneasy about this case, I conjecture, because two shibboleths intersect: "me vs. I" and "like vs. as".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, neither of these prescriptivist bugbears applies here — but the only thing that Walker recalls (or pretends to recall) from his grammatical instruction is that he should be nervous whenever one of these choices arises, and thus doubly nervous when both choices arise at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quoted phrase (&amp;quot;… everyone should write like me&amp;quot;), &lt;em&gt;like me&lt;/em&gt; is a prepositional phrase functioning as a manner adverbial. That is, &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; takes a noun-phrase complement, as in "walk like an angel", "ran like nobody's business", "handles like a shopping cart with a wobbly wheel"; and the combination  &lt;em&gt;like + NounPhrase&lt;/em&gt; serves as an adjunct telling us how someone or something writes, walks, runs,  handles. etc. When the complement happens to be one of the pronouns that still indicates case, it's naturally in the objective case: here "me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it has been for several hundred years. Shakespeare wrote in &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt; "Doting like me, and like me banished". Thomas Campion's &lt;em&gt;My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love&lt;/em&gt; ("Set foorth to be song to the Lute, Orpherian, and Base Violl") attempted to improve on &lt;a href="http://rudy.negenborn.net/catullus/text2/l5.htm"&gt;Catullus Carmen 5&lt;/a&gt; with these lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;If all would lead their lives in love like mee,&lt;br&gt;
Then bloudie swords and armour should not be,&lt;br&gt;
No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleepes should move,&lt;br&gt;
Unles alar'me came from the campe of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift, in &lt;em&gt;The Lady's Dressing Room&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;He soon would learn to think like me,&lt;br&gt;
And bless his ravisht Sight to see&lt;br&gt;
Such Order from Confusion sprung,&lt;br&gt;
Such gaudy Tulips rais'd from Dung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southey, &lt;em&gt;To Lycon&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Be mine, in age's drooping hour, to see&lt;br&gt;
The lisping children climb their grandsire's knee,&lt;br&gt;
And train the future race to live and act like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelley, &lt;em&gt;Julian and Maddolo&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Even the instinctive worm on which we tread&lt;br&gt;
Turns, though it wound not–then with prostrate head&lt;br&gt;
Sinks in the dust and writhes like me–and dies?&lt;br&gt;
No: wears a living death of agonies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dickens, The Old Curiosity Shop: &amp;quot;… he told me about my mother, and how she once looked and spoke just like me when she was a little child&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on.  So why does Walker (pretend to?) worry about whether &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; is "correct"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first reason involves a chain of events something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Many people say or write things like "you and me were meant to be".&lt;br&gt;
2. Others complain that this is illogical — &amp;quot;you and me&amp;quot; is the subject, so it should be &amp;quot;you and I&amp;quot;. (Grammar is not logic, cf. French &amp;quot;vous et moi&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;vous et je&amp;quot;; but never mind.)&lt;br&gt;
3. Chastened, some people say or write things like "between you and I".&lt;br&gt;
4. Others then complain that "you and I" is the complement of &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt;, so it should be "you and me".&lt;br&gt;
5. Result: people like Mr. Walker, who have never been taught to recognize subject or complements or any other grammatical entities, enter a state of nervous cluelessness about  how to choose between &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; in any case where doubt might arise, and even in many cases where there should never have been any doubt at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is the strange prescriptivist animus against conjunctive &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. "Some people prune English roses like they do Hybrid Teas". The description below is summarized from the account in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;pg=PA600"&gt;MWDEU&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Like&lt;/em&gt; has been used conjunctively (i.e. to introduce a subordinate clause) since the 14th century, by Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats, Dickens, Shaw, etc.&lt;br&gt;
2. At some point, this became controversial. Noah Webster's 1790 list of "improper and vulgar expressions" included "He thinks like you do"; Tennyson corrected Prince Albert for using conjunctive &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;; Henry Alford said conjunctive &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; was &amp;quot;quite indefensible&amp;quot;; and Strunk &amp;amp; White scorned it as &amp;quot;widely misused by the illiterate&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;taken up by the knowing … who use it as if they were slumming&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
3. This attitude requires banning (what previously were) perfectly standard and commonplace uses (Winston Churchill: "We were overrun by them, like the Australians were by rabbits").&lt;br&gt;
4. No fault is thereby found with  &lt;em&gt;like &amp;lt;noun-phrase&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;; but the prescription against the standard and still-common instances of conjunctive &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; leaves the Walkers of the world in a state of nervous cluelessness about any use of &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q.E.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Walker reads "I don't think everyone should write like me", and  thinks (or pretends to think?), "Wait, isn't there something wrong with that?"&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248437522538"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3408">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f7061076ba63f5c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Guidelines for posting</title><published>2009-07-24T12:01:31Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T12:01:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/guidelines-for-posting/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of recent threads have begun to turn into flame wars.  To prevent this website from degenerating, here are a few guidelines for posting.  If you flout them, your posts are subject to removal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Do not call people names.  I don’t like to see people called “idiots” or “morons” to their e-face, no matter who they are.  Let’s keep the discourse calm and civil, although of course passionate &lt;em&gt;arguments&lt;/em&gt; are welcome — indeed, encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  If you’re coming here to claim that the “theory” of evolution is a hoax, or is in some important way incorrect, you’re probably at the wrong place.  Realize that you are fighting 150 years of solid evidence.  The evidence for evolution is of course the topic of my book, which is also the title of this website.  If you think you have new and dramatic evidence that modern evolutionary theory is wrong, give it.  If you just want to rant, there are plenty of other blogs where they welcome that.  If you’re seeking education about evolution, ask politely for it and then go consult the references you’re given. If you assert something that my book — or many of the other books describing what evolution is and how it works — debunks, you’ll be spanked for not doing your homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  If you’re here to tout some form of intelligent design/creationism, you’re probably at the wrong place as well.  ID and creationism have been thoroughly refuted for years.  I won’t tolerate somebody coming here and announcing that, say, Michael Behe has a lot of great ideas about irreducible complexity.  If you have dramatic new evidence for ID/creationism, give it.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Dale,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the time you took to fill out our website questionnaire.  Unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;I don’t think we are a good fit for developing your website as we are committed Christians&lt;/strong&gt;. I think it would be difficult for us to give our all to a website promoting values and beliefs with which we don’t agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for your time. I hope you understand my reasons for declining your request.&lt;/p&gt;

The topic of genes and autism often seems to be as much about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10_autism_controversies"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; as it is about science. Studies of the genetics of autism (like this &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/27_genes"&gt;recently reported one&lt;/a&gt;) often only seem to have identified genes in a small set of individuals; further, so many genes are pointed to as potentially linked to autism spectrum that the thought of anyone ever honing in on some specific "autism genes" seems quite beyond reach. Then, too, should any specific genetic markers for autism be identified, questions about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/acceptance_and_genetics"&gt;prenatal genetic testing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/eugenics_fear_and_pain"&gt;eugenics&lt;/a&gt; with huge ethical implications arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="http://aaidd.allenpress.com/aamronline/?request=get-abstract&amp;amp;doi=10.1352%2F1944-7558-114.4.269-273"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; linking certain genetic markers to "problem behaviors" in adult males with developmental disabilities highlights all of these concerns; further, it's important not to say that "problem behaviors" are only the fault of the person displaying these, but may well be due to other factors (including how that person is treated and perceived).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;105 white men between the ages of 18 and 50 were participants in a study of the gene enocding  monoamine oxidize A or MAOA, MAOA is, as noted in the July 23rd &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090721122855.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;......involved in the regulation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is linked to appetite and mood, and the neurotransmitter and hormone norepinephrine, which is linked to the fight-or-flight response. Previous studies found that variations in MAOA were linked to violent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAOA has also be linked to "autism in children, autism &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/musings_on_the_dsm-v_revisions_and_severity"&gt;severity&lt;/a&gt; and communication problems."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Problem behaviors" are specifically defined as "aggression, self-injury or property destruction" and are said to occur in 15 to 20 percent of adults with developmental disabilities. A co-author of the study, &lt;a href="http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/x4871.xml"&gt;Craig Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, professor of special education at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of education and human development, says that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Problem behaviors in these populations account for billions of dollars in intervention costs each year, but nearly all of these interventions occur after the fact.......This research suggests one way we might predict which individuals are at risk of being aggressive and destructive and provide treatment before problems occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies on genetics can seem very distant; some raise questions about why research efforts (and dollars) are not devoted to studies about treatments that might have a direct (as in immediate) impact on people's lives. Beyond seeking to identify genes that might contribute to autism, this new study indeed looks at something that specifically affects people's lives, "problem behaviors," with the hope of making it possible to anticipate an individual having such. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of "problem behaviors" mentioned does include some that we've had to address in regard to my own son; no easy task. From dealing with this sort of thing, I do know that "environmental factors" such as what people around my son say and do and numerous other circumstances often as much the reasons for a "behavior" as something internal to him. These sorts of things need always to be kept in mind when considering an individual's "behaviors." It's very possible that the "problem" is as much in other people saying or doing certain things, in a room being too warm or having too harsh lighting and the like, and it's important to be ready and willing to look for such factors, for such sources of the "problem," rather than attributing these to the individual with disabilities alone.&lt;/p&gt;

Mystery Hill is a more correct moniker, but the mystery is why people are so reticent to accept a mundane explanation for observed phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a rocky hill in Salem, NH, giant stones have been placed in a circle by someone. Inevitably, many of these stones line up with astronomical events... it's rather hard to put stones in a circle and NOT have this happen, but for all I know they may have been placed that way on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of the much larger story, but I'm going to focus on one specific element of America's Stonehenge: the "sacrificial stone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Located next to a cave partially constructed of large slabs of granite, this stone table is large enough for a man to lie on. Around its edges are carved grooves which encircle the stone and lead off the edge into a spout that could pour into a bucket or other container. Should you wish to cut a man's throat on this stone, his blood would be collected very conveniently.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248422156362"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4049dd7acc2130a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><category term="Anti-science"/><category term="Central Lancashire"/><category term="Chinese medicine"/><category term="Department of Health"/><category term="NICE"/><category term="Pittilo"/><category term="Robert Gordon's university"/><category term="Salford"/><category term="Traditional Chinese medicine"/><category term="Universities"/><category term="University of Central Lancashire"/><category term="University of Salford"/><category term="University of Westminster"/><category term="Westminster university"/><category term="acupuncture"/><category term="antiscience"/><category term="herbal medicine"/><category term="herbalism"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="badscience"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="Chinese herbal mediicine"/><category term="meridians"/><category term="Qi"/><category term="quackery"/><title type="html">Chinese medicine -acupuncture gobbledygook revealed</title><published>2009-07-24T07:15:35Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T07:15:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.dcscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/salford-acu-head.jpg" width="500" height="226"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture has been in the news since, in a moment of madness, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593"&gt;NICE gave it some credence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people still seem to think that acupuncture is somehow more respectable than, say, homeopathy and crystal healing. If you think that, read &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell"&gt;Barker Bausell’s book&lt;/a&gt; ot &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#singh"&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/a&gt;. It is now absolutely clear that ‘real’ acupuncture is indistinguishable from sham, whether the sham control uses retractable needles, or real needles in the ‘wrong’ places. There has been no clear demonstration of long-lived benefits in any condition, and it is likely that it is no more than a theatrical placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the indistinguishability of ‘real’ and sham &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=945"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; shows, beyond reasonable doubt that all the stuff about “energy flow in meridians” is so much hokum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small group of ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=351"&gt;medical acupuncturists&lt;/a&gt;‘ that believes that it is hokum. but who nonetheless maintain that acupuncture works, despite the evidence to the contrary. But most acupuncturists go for the wholesale gobbledygook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t belive that, take a look at the exam paper that has come into my possession. It is this year’s exam from the University of Salford. Salford has, very sensibly, now decided to stop all its degrees in alternative medicine, so don’t hold this against the university too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/SalfordChineseMedicine.pdf"&gt;download the entire exam paper&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/salford-acu-q1.jpg" alt="Q1" width="500" height="149"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So students, in 2009, are being taught the crudest form of vitalism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/salford-acu-q5.jpg" alt="Q5" width="350" height="152"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh really. Perhaps protons neutrons and electrons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/salford-acu-q22.jpg" alt="Q22" width="500" height="51"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK I’d fail that one because the words have no obvious meaning at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/salford-acu-q23.jpg" alt="Q23" width="500" height="50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an elementary textbook of embryology would help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/salford-acu-q24.jpg" alt="Q24" width="500" height="67"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How one would love to see a set of model answers for these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is ancient hokum being taugh to hapless students in the 21st century as though it were fact. The University of Salford has understood that and closed the course. All we need now is for NICE and the Department of Health to understand what it is that they are promoting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NICE neglected the cultural cost of their guidance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/"&gt;National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&lt;/a&gt; (NICE) included an acupuncture option on their low back pain guidance, they quite forget that one effect of their decision would be to ensure that new generations of students would have their minds poisoned with intellectual junk like this. That is why NICE really must think again. . See also&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1516"&gt;NICE falls for bait and switch by acupuncturists and chiropractors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542"&gt;NICE fiasco part 2  Rawlins should withdraw guidance and start again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593"&gt;NICE fiasco Part 3. Too many vested interests, not enough honesty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pittilo and statutory regulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public consultation is due to open shortly on the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;appalling repor&lt;/a&gt;t of the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK (see also, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the recommendations is that acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine should have statutory regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC), despite the fact that that would involve the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284"&gt;HPC breaking its own rules&lt;/a&gt;. Another recommendation of Pittilo is that entry to the “profession” (his word, not mine) should be by means of honours degree only.  So he wants to impose on students exams like this one in order to “protect the public”?  The absurdity of that proposal should be obvious now. This exam paper will form part of my evidence to the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is one other small problem.  Universities are busy shutting down their degrees in alternative medicine, now that the ridiculousness of what is taught has been exposed.  They have shut down entirely at the&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885"&gt; University of Salford&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899"&gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, And even the&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812"&gt; University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; is working on closing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All we need now is for the common sense and integrity that has been shown by these universities to spread to the Department of Health (and NICE).&lt;/p&gt;

In retrospect, the things I liked about him were his harsh criticisms of religion and our shared politics on many issues. And last year when Maher released his film, &lt;em&gt;Religulous&lt;/em&gt;, I considered it one of the best films of the year. And even though in the film and while promoting the film, Maher continued to perpetuate the myth that being an “atheist” means absolute certainty that there is no god, while he just simply respond with something akin to, I don’t know and neither do you, but I highly doubt it (the atheist position), I still liked Maher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’d heard that Maher had wacky beliefs about medicine but I hadn’t really heard him discuss them. But perhaps I just didn’t want to hear them and just wanted to believe Maher was as rational as he seemed to be when criticizing religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to believe that Maher was only a little wacky when it comes to modern medicine but I really had no idea how much of that Kool-Aid he drank. But &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php#more"&gt;Orac has opened my eyes to Maher’s beliefs&lt;/a&gt; when arguing why Maher should not receive the Richard Dawkins Award, an award that is intended to not only celebrate one’s promotion of atheism but one’s commitment to science and reason. He opened my eyes and now I’m afraid I can’t shut them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orac makes a really, really compelling case against Maher, quoting past comments he’s made over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re in denial, about I think is a key fact, which is it is the at… people get sick because of an aggregate toxicity, because their body has so much poison in it, from the air, the water…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Maher’s anti-medical comments have been about as bad as they get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe in vaccination either. That’s a… well, that’s a… what? That’s another theory that I think is flawed, that we go by the Louis Pasteur theory, even though Louis Pasteur renounced it on his own deathbed and said that Beauchamp(s) was right: it’s not the invading germs, it’s the terrain. It’s not the mosquitoes, it’s the swamp that they are breeding in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher even discouraged David Letterman from continuing to take his heart medicine a few years ago when Letterman suffered from heart disease that required a multiple coronary artery bypass operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letterman:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you interested in medical journals and that sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maher:&lt;/strong&gt; Not western medicine, I think we’re being poisoned…I would love for you to investigate the possibility that your health issues might have arisen from the fact that you’re being poisoned by America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea he was that delusional. I love the Bill Maher that gave us Religulous but the amount of pseudoscience he promotes does not reflect well on atheism or on Dawkins’ name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is there mucus?…It’s because your body is toxic and it’s trying to create a river to get rid of these toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maher represents everything Dawkins debunks in his &lt;em&gt;Enemies of Reason&lt;/em&gt; special. Maher really needs to be challenged on his BS, not rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the same thing as with figures like Penn and Teller, who while may hold some wacky views, aren’t advocating that all of modern medicine is wrong. Also, Penn and Teller can and allegedly have been persuaded to change their minds on some of the issues they criticized on their show, even talking about possibly making an episode that debunks some of their own bullshit, which was previously promoted on the show.  So while I disagree with them on some issues, they’re far more rational than not. But no position I’ve ever heard them defend comes anywhere near as bad as Maher’s denial of germ theory and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather the receiver of the Richard Dawkins Award believe and promote the view that the Earth is 6000 years old than have them promote germ theory denial and anti-vaccinationism. It’s not even close. And I would prefer Maher just believed in a young Earth than his current beliefs on medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540"&gt;end &lt;/a&gt;of my series* on ‘Acupuncture Anesthesia’, I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Westerners—Michael DeBakey and John Bonica being exceptions—who observed ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in China during the Cultural Revolution seem to have failed to recognize what was going on right under their noses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have added–and I now have–Arthur Taub’s name to that tiny group. Taub, a neurologist and neurophysiologist at Yale, was a member of a delegation of Americans sent to China to observe ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in May of 1974, about a year after &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=494"&gt;Dr. Bonica&lt;/a&gt;’s visit. The delegation included several prominent anesthesiologists. Their report,  &lt;em&gt;Acupuncture Anesthesia in the People’s Republic of China:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A Trip Report of the American Acupuncture Anesthesia Study Group&lt;/em&gt;, was published in 1976 and is available in its entirety &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books/download/Acupuncture_anesthesia_in_the_People_s_R.pdf?id=UjQrAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;output=pdf&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U3Vt6Dph38MxkBEKWRsdrDa-D2M6w&amp;amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Excerpts follow (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain is a subjective experience. Judging whether an individual is in a state of pain depends on observations of the subject’s behavior, including verbal reports to the observer…When there is no evidence of pain, the observer can adopt one of three positions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A judgment about pain cannot be made because of lack of evidence. The corollary of this position is that only the presence—not the absence—of pain is recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pain is present in spite of lack of evidence. This position accepts the notion that pain-associated behavior and autonomic responses can be withheld by the subject, but that the presence of pain can be inferred from other factors, such as the presence of extensive tissue damage. This position also implies that the observational measures currently available are too crude to form the sole basis for judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since there is no evidence for pain, there is no pain. Although this is the position most often adopted by clinicians and pain researchers, it relies heavily upon the observer’s skill and accepts the notion that a judgment about the presence or absence of pain can be made on the basis of behavioral observations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major area of disagreement among members of the group derived from the above issue…The grading system employed indicates &lt;strong&gt;acceptance of the last position by most members of the delegation&lt;/strong&gt;…It was not possible for the group to reach complete accord regarding the degree of hypalgesia under acupuncture, since it could always be argued that, for whatever reason, our observations were inadequate to judge the extent of private pain experience. The realities of life and patient management, however, continually force us to make judgments about pain on the basis of the best evidence available. To the extent that this is possible, then, the group could conclude that the majority of patients were not in pain during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation was quick to dispense with the term “acupuncture anesthesia”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be clearly understood that acupuncture does not produce conventional surgical anesthesia. In no instance is sensation totally abolished or consciousness disturbed; thus, acupuncture anesthesia is a misnomer. There is considerable evidence, however, that acupuncture affects the pain experience, although our observations suggest that complete analgesia may not occur. Therefore, the term acupuncture analgesia is similarly inappropriate. In view of these limitations, it seems more reasonable to refer to the phenomenon as acupuncture hypalgesia (AH), which may then be graded according to the effectiveness of pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group used a grading system similar to that devised by Chinese physicians in Shanghai, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=494"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Bonica. The 1974 delegation, however, accepted Grades I and II as being satisfactory, whereas Dr. Bonica had implied acceptance of only Grade I (the Chinese considered only Grade IV to represent &lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt; of the technique). Using that scale, the 1974 delegation found 22 of the 48 observed cases to have been in Grade I and a further 13 in Grade II, for an overall “satisfactory” rate of 73% (compared to 30% reported by Dr. Bonica). They further reckoned–were told, that is, by their hosts–that about 15% of operations in China were being performed under acupuncture anesthesia (also a much higher percentage than Dr. Bonica’s estimate), and thus concluded that acupuncture provided satisfactory anesthesia for 10% of all operations being done in China at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1974 delegation barely addressed political issues, but some of their observations seem telling in retrospect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our Chinese colleagues, only good-risk patients, who are not apprehensive and express their willingness to accept AH are selected after a visit by the acupuncturist or the surgeon…To the best of the study group’s knowledge, coercion is not employed…Selection of patients is also determined to a major degree by the type of pathology anticipated. A precise diagnosis is necessary since extensive exploration produces pain during AH. The procedure should offer no untoward problems such as adhesions, infiltrative tumors, or hemorrhagic complications…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Unlike Dr. Bonica, this delegation did not wonder why, if acupuncture was so safe and effective, it was not used preferentially for high-risk patients or procedures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain other patients are also considered inappropriate candidates for AH. Children under the age of 15 are rarely included because, as we were told, they cannot be relied upon to remain quiet during the procedure…The role of peer acceptance and national pride on the part of patients were believed to be important factors by some of our colleagues, but there was no objective evidence for or against these opinions.The majority of patients received 100 mg of phenobarbital and/or 50 mg to 100 mg of meperidine (Demerol) from 20 to 60 minutes prior to the operation. With the exception of a case of near or actual coma due to a brain tumor, all patients entered the operating room awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation observed one veterinary case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy aging horse was observed during demonstration of an exploratory laparotomy performed with the aid of acupuncture hypalgesia. It seemed less than a dramatically successful performance, as the horse appeared glassy-eyed and frequently struggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their conclusion, the group wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acupuncture stimulation can be effectively used for the control of pain in approximately 10 percent of surgical patients in the People’s Republic of China. It is important to recognize that this is an experimental technique at present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acupuncture appears to modify the pain experience at times to a remarkable degree…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AH is a significant human biological phenomenon of unknown mechanisms. The induction of a hypnotic trance is not necessary. Social factors may be important in some instances but are not, of themselves, sufficient to account for the effects observed. Some psychophysiologic process appears to be important in modifying the experience of pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effectiveness of acupuncture hypalgesia varies in different procedures, between different patients, and even within the same patient at different times…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to some of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=131"&gt;early reports&lt;/a&gt; by Westerners, these statements were cautious. Knowing what we &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540"&gt;now know&lt;/a&gt; about ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in China during the Cultural Revolution, however, the analysis appears to be an example of academics being &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=561"&gt;“overconfident in their ability to understand how things work.”&lt;/a&gt; In particular, most of the members of this group failed to distinguish between patients who were free to report pain and those who were not, and failed to recognize that their Chinese hosts were motivated,  by threat of exile from job, home, and family, to make the appearance very different from the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Taub had a different point of view. A footnote to the report is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One member of the study group, Arthur Taub, dissents from the conclusions expressed in this report. His views on acupuncture hypalgesia have been published in various scientific journals…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An Unfortunate Misportrayal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Dr. Taub’s views are those of one of his colleagues, Yale surgeon Sherwin Nuland, who witnessed ‘acupuncture anesthesia’ in China in 1990. He told of this experience at the first &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/newsletter/2009_may/strauslecture1.htm"&gt;“Stephen E. Straus Distinguished Lecture&lt;/a&gt; in the Science of Complementary and Alternative Medicine,” given at the NIH on March 10, 2009. Dr. Nuland is an &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sherwin-B.-Nuland/e/B000AP9K5G/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1"&gt;author &lt;/a&gt;of some note. I’ve read parts of several of his books and have found him to be a good writer who seems particularly committed to accurate &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Plague-Childbed-Semmelweis-Discoveries/dp/039332625X/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_7"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;. This lecture, unfortunately, was an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nuland suggested that the recent advent of acupuncture anesthesia in China had entirely to do with the paucity of modern anesthesia practitioners and equipment. He credited Mao Zedong with having encouraged it, but gave no indication of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=505"&gt;political complexity&lt;/a&gt; of Mao’s decisions or of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540"&gt;coercion &lt;/a&gt;involved in executing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nuland did not mention the reports or opinions of Drs. Bonica, DeBakey, or Taub. He cited the report of the 1974 delegation, implying that it was the first of its kind, but opined that it had been too skeptical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Remarkably, they came to the conclusion that the method might be useful in only about 10% of cases…and this was in spite of the fact that if you look into this report, and look at the individual cases, in more than half of those situations, acupuncture went perfectly well; the procedure went well, there was no problem with it, and it’s a little difficult to know why they were hesitant to write in favor of it except that they had no idea how it worked, and maybe that was the reason: Western physicians, Western scientists, are not prone to use technologies whose origins they have no understanding of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Dr. Nuland misunderstood the report: the “10%” figure was derived from the delegation’s view of the success rate, about 70%, multiplied by the 15% of operations that their Chinese hosts had informed them were appropriate for acupuncture anesthesia. Thus the 1974 delegation (with the exception of Dr. Taub) did, in essence, “write in favor” of the method. Whether or not Dr. Nuland understood this, he used the occasion to accuse “Western scientists” of being petty and closed-minded—much to the delight, I’ve no doubt, of his hosts at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). Like the late Director for whom the lecture had been named, Dr. Nuland seems to have quickly grasped the power of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=68"&gt;misleading language&lt;/a&gt; in addressing such an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a theme throughout his talk. Regarding nature, suggested Nuland, the Chinese philosophy of ‘harmony’ trumps Western notions of ’subjugation’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about Traditional Chinese Medicine: the basic principle is the concept of harmony, and, in this configuration, man is such an integral part of the natural world that he can only survive, he can only do well, by doing everything he can to fit into the functioning of the natural world, unlike Western science, which analyzes every characteristic of nature, with a view toward influencing or perhaps subjugating it.The Chinese philosophy seeks an understanding of nature’s world, so that Man may bow to its laws, and remain unhindered as a part of its never-ending cycle. The inter-relatedness of the universe extends to all things and is exemplified by the principles, and here come two very familiar words, of yin and yang…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In studying natural phenomena, holism and mysticism are preferable to small-minded Western reductionism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental teachings of Western science is that natural phenomena are best studied by separating them into their component parts, to observe them, uninfluenced by surrounding variables; but it’s fundamental to Chinese medical teaching that attempts to do this are senseless, ’cause you can’t really find out how something functions unless it’s functioning in harmony with the other characteristics that are involved with it. Interdependence, and inter-relatedness, in this philosophy, are at the very basis of why things happen the way they do. Involved in the inter-relatedness of all things is the principle of Qi…an abstract form of influence analogous to what an American might call vital energy or life force. We’re not quite sure what they are, but many of us believe there is such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigid, orthodox, Western scientific dogma points to the need for a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=120"&gt;new paradigm&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional Chinese Medicine is a vast collection of never-proved, time-honored theories, many of which have also been honored by a considerable degree of success. So far, the basis of that success has never been shown, or explained, to a degree that is completely acceptable to orthodox, Western scientists using orthodox, Western, investigative techniques…what is needed is a new paradigm; a new way of looking at, and interpreting, all of the evidence and observations that we make of the processes of diseases and health…there are phenomena that cannot be fully explained by today’s biomedical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stubborn Western scientists would, it seems, sacrifice the practical for the theoretical, even when faced with overwhelming evidence for the former. Nuland quoted James Reston’s report about Chinese surgeons and acupuncture anesthesia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…while they cannot agree on the theory of how needle anesthesia works, they are increasingly convinced that it does work, and they’re operating on the pragmatic evidence and they are not waiting for theoretical justification. There is enough objective evidence of practical medical information in the use of acupuncture to justify exploration by somebody more scientific than newspaper reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nuland, like so many others, misrepresented James Reston’s &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=131"&gt;personal experience&lt;/a&gt; with acupuncture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…postoperatively, he had a significant amount of pain, pain in the wound, gas pain, this sort of thing, and they treated the wound with acupuncture on each occasion that it occurred, and it worked every single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also offered the standard, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=252"&gt;exaggerated claim&lt;/a&gt; of acupuncture’s antiquity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The earliest description of acupuncture that has been found was written in about 900 B.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nuland reported having observed a woman undergoing excision of thyroid cysts under acupuncture anesthesia. She had received phenobarbital, 40 mg, prior to arriving in the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before the surgical drapes were put into place Mrs. Hu had been given an intravenous dose of 40 mg of Demerol, also not an awful lot, and 4 mg of droperidol, which is a tranquilizing agent. Small to moderate amounts, they seemed to have no effect whatsoever on her level of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not, but the combination of Demerol (a narcotic) and droperidol (a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic"&gt;neuroleptic &lt;/a&gt;) would have had a substantial effect on her perception of pain. Such a combination was in vogue in anesthetic practice 2-3 decades ago, and produced a remarkable state of indifference to pain in awake patients. The quoted droperidol dose was not small to moderate, moreover, but substantial. Nevertheless,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced that what I saw of surgical acupuncture is exactly what people claim it is: it’s a profound elevation of the pain threshhold and tolerance brought about by a mechanism or mechanisms that have not yet been fully explained in terms that are acceptable to Western science–its paradigm of biomedical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nuland mentioned nothing of the Cultural Revolution, of the overwhelming political pressures that occurred at that time, or of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=540"&gt;exposés &lt;/a&gt;of surgical torture that appeared in its aftermath–although this information had been available for nearly three decades. Even if he believes that there is something to ‘acupuncture anesthesia,’ this discussion should have been part of a Distinguished Lecture given to the NCCAM in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

This wonderful program, now in its twelfth year, is run by Bill Berner, who can also pull together any demonstration you may wish for in your classes. Guided by Bill, a number of other staff members and a local high school physics teacher, the students (”academically qualified high school students currently enrolled in 10th, 11th, or 12th grade”) go through an intensive physics experience for four weeks, including mini-courses, demos, research lectures, lab work and field trips, finishing up with a panel discussion on careers in science, featuring professionals from research, education, and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I got to play a small part in this by delivering a lecture on modern cosmology&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/pssa.JPG" title="pssa.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/pssa.JPG" alt="pssa.JPG" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am repeatedly amazed whenever I do something like this by how eager people are to hear about cosmology, and by the great questions they come up with that get to the heart of what is known and what is at the edge of our understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tuesday’s lecture I didn’t even get to any of the more esoteric topics, such as inflation, although we did talk about cosmic acceleration a little, and discussed dark matter quite a lot. Lots of times when one talks about dark matter, people are fascinated by the particle physics possibilities - sometimes they’ve heard of supersymmetry, for example, and want to understand what dark matter might have to do with it. But interestingly most of the questions I got yesterday were empirical in nature, concerning how we know what we know about dark matter, and why we think it behaves the way it does. This is, of course, as it should be. It might be a consequence of this being an experimentally focused program, but whatever it is, it is clear that Bill and everyone else is doing a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take much time to take part in something like this - an hour of lecture and thirty to forty minutes of discussion afterwards. And it is immensely fun and rewarding. If the students enjoyed themselves half as much as I did then I’ll be delighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248406412976"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/preview_of_the_shenanigans.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3209b213ef3222c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Preview of the Shenanigans...</title><published>2009-07-24T03:11:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-24T03:11:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/nsYlpJ_nrEQ/preview_of_the_shenanigans.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/preview_of_the_shenanigans.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I promise you all this tonight when I have had a beer (or two) and am feeling very benevolent.

Note that it is a little different from scienceblog&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;.com — it lacks the &amp;quot;s&amp;quot;. There are a few other differences, too: it&amp;#39;s a site that simply reprints press releases. Send &amp;#39;em anything, and they&amp;#39;ll spit it back up on the web for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such example is a press release titled &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/life-earth-came-other-planets-23230.html"&gt;Life on Earth came from other planets&lt;/a&gt;. It purports to be a summary of a peer-reviewed, published research paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Life on Earth Came From Other Planets," by R. Joseph, Ph.D. Cosmology, Vol 1. 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few funny things about this article. The journal Cosmology doesn&amp;#39;t seem to exist. Then notice &amp;quot;Vol. 1&amp;quot;…this is the inaugural issue. It contains a grand total of one (1) paper, the aforementioned article by Rhawn Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait! It does exist! The "journal" exists as a web page only; go ahead, here's &lt;a href="http://Cosmology.com/Cosmology1.html"&gt;Cosmology, 2009, Vol 1, pages 00000&lt;/a&gt;. You can read the whole article, which you know was peer reviewed, because it says so in the upper left corner: "Peer Reviewed".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess who the web page can be traced to? Rhawn Joseph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you begin to see a pattern here. If you can't get your crappy paper published in a legitimate journal, invent one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/life-earth-came-other-planets-23230.html"&gt;comments at scienceblog.com&lt;/a&gt; are hilarious, too. To his credit, the author of the site, Fred Bortz, shows up to offer objections to the weird quality of the submission; someone named Joy Haiyan Wu, who works with Rhawn, pops up a few times to complain and threaten legal action. A &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/life-earth-came-other-planets-23230.html#comment-38259"&gt;comment by Christopher Coffee&lt;/a&gt; pretty much nails the phoniness of the whole effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the &lt;a href="http://Cosmology.com/Cosmology1.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; itself? Complete garbage. It presents nothing new, makes exaggerated claims about the likelihood of bacterial life surviving in space for hundreds of millions of years (it wouldn't), makes grand claims of revolutionizing our understanding of the origins of life, and offers nothing other than rehashed claims and denial of legitimate scientific hypotheses. You can get a taste of how poor this paper is from just the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life on Earth appeared while this planet was still forming. There is no proof life can be created from non-life. As only life can produce life, only panspermia is a viable scientific explanation as to the origin of Earthly life. The first life forms to appear on Earth were produced by other living creatures who were likely encased in debris ejected by the parent star nearly 5 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, life had to have come from non-life at some point, logically speaking. The claim that only life can produce life clearly had to have been wrong at some point, and panspermia doesn't get around the fundamental problem: where did the life at that distant exploding star come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t even mentioned yet that the writing is incoherent and poorly organized, the paper is full of typos, and although it contains many citations, the references have been left off…and instead we get a repetition of ten ads flogging Rhawn Joseph&amp;#39;s self-published book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to issue 2 of volume 1 of Cosmology. Perhaps it will have another paper by Rhawn Joseph? &lt;/p&gt;

Empathy, for example, seems to hinge in part on our ability to “take on” another’s emotions through vicarious experience. I always think of this when watching a comedian fall flat. I can feel the embarrassment as if I’m standing there on stage looking at a room full of blank stares. 

A new study in the journal Psychological Science investigated this dynamic, but from a different angle: researchers wanted to know if observing someone else exert self-control boosts or reduces one’s own self-control.

This pattern is near universal when it comes to autism interventions. In the absence of good quality research, autism interventions are loudly claimed to be effective. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those promoting ABA-based autism interventions, claims of effectiveness unfounded in good quality research were only the first step. The real triumph has been widespread agreement that fair tests of ABA-based interventions are unethical and bad for autistics. As a result, any experimental design carrying the risk of being informative about the benefits and harms of ABA-based interventions has, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3571656"&gt;for a long time now&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2007/06/tale-of-two-aba-studies.html"&gt;been considered unethical&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The practice of claiming effectiveness for an autism intervention which has not been fairly tested, then using these claims of effectiveness to deem fair tests unethical, has clear benefits to service providers. And this practice has received wall-to-wall support from autism advocates, who have in turn imposed it on autistics through lobbying and litigation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/09/the-fishy-reckoning/"&gt;this practice is not admired outside the realm of autism advocacy&lt;/a&gt;. Premature claims of effectiveness in themselves make fair tests of interventions more difficult--particularly, as is the case with many autism interventions, when blinding cannot be fully achieved. But those promoting ABA-based autism interventions go further and demand that autistics be entirely denied the benefit and protection of good experimental design.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, this practice--its longstanding and widespread support by autism advocates, its more recent support by ASAN (example &lt;a href="http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=33&amp;amp;keywords=restraints&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=572e713471ea96d9fe9c5ad4a5c0939d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and its widespread imposition on autistics--continues to greatly harm autistics. Any group so denied such basic standards of science and ethics would be harmed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly, not all autism researchers have stooped to prevailing autism advocacy standards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some years ago, a pilot RCT of an early autism intervention was published (Aldred et al., 2004). The intervention was manualized, of relatively low intensity, and targeted solely at the parents of preschool autistic children. Through a true experimental design, the intervention was found to have several significant positive effects, most markedly in increasing the expressive language of very young autistic children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Successful RCTs of early autism interventions are virtually non-existent. But the researchers involved in Aldred et al. (2004) totally failed to go forth and proclaim the effectiveness of their manualized intervention. After all, they only had a small pilot RCT--the same size as the only published RCT, not a notably successful one (Smith et al., 2000, 2001), in the entire 48-year history of research into ABA-based autism interventions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of issuing premature claims of effectiveness, the authors of Aldred et al. (2004) and many other collaborating UK researchers went on to conduct a large multi-site RCT, the &lt;a href="http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/pact/"&gt;Preschool Autism Communication Trial&lt;/a&gt;. They received &lt;a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC002047"&gt;MRC funding for this 4-year project in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some information about the PACT&amp;#39;s design has been reported in a recent paper (Aldred &amp;amp; Green, 2009). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trial began in early 2006 and will finish late this year. The researchers hoped to recruit 144 preschool autistic children across three sites, but exceeded their expectations and recruited 152. These children were randomized into two arms, one receiving the PACT intervention, while children in both arms continued to receive whatever other interventions their parents chose ("treatment as usual").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far as I know, the PACT is larger than any existing published RCT in the history of autism research. The PACT's design means that it carries a good risk of being informative about the effectiveness of the studied intervention. There is no good reason for the PACT to be unprecedented, but it is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/pact/newsletters/REF%20PACT%20newsletter%20manc%20jan%2009.pdf"&gt;one of the PACT's recent newsletters&lt;/a&gt;, the PACT's Chief Investigator, Jonathan Green, notes that there has been a lot of interest in the PACT manual and in "training opportunities" with respect to this intervention. Dr Green responds:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Until we have the results of the trial we are not able to disseminate the intervention manual or to undertake any training; but be assured that after the results are in (and depending of course on the outcome in terms of effectiveness!) we do have potential plans in place for such dissemination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, and keeping in mind there is a successful published pilot RCT, there are no plans to disseminate information about the intervention--not until there is good quality evidence as to its effectiveness. This is the recognized scientific standard in non-autism areas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aldred et al. (2004) and the PACT shouldn't in any way be above scrutiny or criticism. For example, I can see problems in how Aldred et al. (2004) was designed (I mention one of them &lt;a href="http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/06/notes-on-autism-severity-and-dsm-v.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), which may or may not be carried over to the PACT. But the pilot RCT and the resulting PACT generally demonstrate the only science- and ethic-based sequence when it comes to interventions and treatments: good quality research first, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; think about spreading the word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=British+Journal+of+Hospital+Medicine&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Early+social+communication%0D%0Ainterventions+for+autism&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=70&amp;amp;rft.issue=3&amp;amp;rft.spage=143&amp;amp;rft.epage=145&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F19274002&amp;amp;rft.au=Aldred%2C+C.R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Green%2C+J.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Clinical+Research%2CPsychology%2CAutism%2C+Ethics"&gt;Aldred, C.R., &amp;amp; Green, J.

From my notes though I still have the quote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "special needs" education, there is plenty of effort to teach the skills of the non-autistic to the autistic, but in the regular classroom we are often doing the opposite. I view higher (and lower) education as teaching people to be more autistic in many of their basic cognitive skills...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This filter for looking at the types of skills that are taught in public schools is particularly interesting in light of recent research regarding &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/got_a_problem_with_that"&gt;autistic problem solving skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of import is the role of point of view and bias in how the education of autistic and non-autistic students is framed.  Teaching non-autistic students (the majority) the skills of the minority is considered building strengths.  Teaching autistic students (the minority) the skills of the majority is considered remediating deficits.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relates directly back to Norman Kunc's model of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_3_of_6_wherein_norman_kunc_rocks_my_world"&gt;perspectives on disability&lt;/a&gt; (see the line item on deficiency and remediation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interconnections between broader civil rights issues and seemingly unrelated topics like education and science are subtle, but strong.  Civil rights issues color the lens through which people are viewed, framed, and treated in all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248390909273"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-8384510648941370434">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/084a00847625d820</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lab" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Churchill fieldwork 4.</title><published>2009-07-23T21:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-28T16:30:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/74VmoPdAKhI/churchill-fieldwork-4.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=8384510648941370434" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/07/churchill-fieldwork-4.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;What the heck are you doing up there anyway?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been posting photos and clips of some of our adventures up here in Churchill, but I haven't yet discussed in any detail what we're actually doing.  Today is a foggy day with not much prospect for collecting, so it seems like an opportune time to fill in the blanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As many readers will know, the primary area of research in my lab is the evolution of genome size -- that is, the amount of DNA (including genes and noncoding DNA together) in different species.  In animals, this ranges about 7,000-fold and is unrelated to organism complexity.  It is, however, correlated with cell size and cell division and, depending on the group, with body size, metabolism, development, and other features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In some groups, there appears to be a latitudinal pattern as well, with species in northern regions having larger genomes than temperate relatives.  We're exploring this question in various invertebrates and in plants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why Churchill?  Several reasons.  First, Churchill has an excellent (and soon to be significantly updated) research station.  Second, it includes a range of environments, including both freshwater and marine, boreal and tundra, and lakes, streams, and ponds.  Third, Churchill is one of two sites that is the focus of a "barcoding biotas" initiative to generate DNA barcodes of the entire fauna of a specific place (the other is Moorea in French Polynesia).  This means that there are many expert taxonomists involved with whom we can collaborate, and also that we can perform identifications on many species that otherwise would be very difficult to work with.  Fourth, this is where the Arctic ecology field course is held, which means we have an army of students out collecting samples.  Finally, Paul Hebert and I co-authored a grant as part of the international polar year that provided funding for work in this area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basic procedure is to go to various sites, collect everything of interest, bring it back to the station, and process it.  This means cataloguing, photographing, labelling, and storing the specimens (mostly in liquid nitrogen cryoshippers).  Once we get back to the lab, we will perform genome size estimates using a flow cytometer. For spiders, I am making slides here and will do the genome sizes using image analysis densitometry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have five people here from our lab, each working on a different group but all collecting and sharing material from the taxa we're working with.  This includes insects, molluscs, crustaceans, spiders, leeches, soil invertebrates, and for the first time, plants.  Actually, the latter are being collected for us by expert botanists who are working with the DNA barcoding group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far we have about 500 samples collected, and we have roughly 2 weeks left to get more.  The shippers can hold 1,200 vials, and this doesn't include plants, spiders, and most of the molluscs, which are not being frozen.  We are also experimenting with some new field preservation methods which we hope will enable future studies like this in other places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lots of people are interested in genome size (usually framed in terms of "why is there so much junk DNA?").  One approach, definitely the most common, is to sit around and speculate.  Another is to focus on a few genome sequences and look for conserved and/or transcribed elements.  Our preference is to look at hundreds of species and see how diversity of genome size is actually distributed.  Sometimes that means collecting in the cold wind and being eaten alive by mosquitoes.  Next, we really should study tropical species...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_______&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/07/churchill-fieldwork-series.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the Churchill fieldwork posts.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-8384510648941370434?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/74VmoPdAKhI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248390231842"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/magic.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bca15275b4140d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Absurd medical claims"/><title type="html">Magic diet?

Real medicine has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws"&gt;a Clarkeian quality &lt;/a&gt;to it*; it's so successful, it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like magic.  But real doctors know that there is nothing magic about it.  The "magic" is based on hard work, sound scientific principles, and years of study.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic words are great. Terms like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/medicine_and_belief_part_n1.php"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/i_do_not_think_it_means_what_y.php"&gt;functional medicine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/hey_fake_autism_experts---put.php"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; take a complicated problem and create a simple but false answer with no real data to back it up. More often than not, the magic word is the invention of a single person who had a really interesting idea, but lacked the intellectual capacity or honesty to flesh it out.  Magic is, ultimately, a lie of sorts.  As TAM 7 demonstrates, many magicians are skeptics, and vice versa.  In interviews, magicians will often say that they came to skepticism when the learned just how easy it is to deceive people.  Magic words in alternative medicine aren't sleight-of-hand, but sleight-of-mind, playing on people's hopes and fears.&lt;br&gt;

Symptoms most commonly appear around age 40, and they progress gradually from subtle movement abnormalities to complete loss of motor control and dementia. Psychiatric problems, especially depression and  irritability, are also common and may be the first signs. Treatment consists of medications to mask some of the symptoms. Singer &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodie_Guthrie"&gt;Woodie Guthrie&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the disease's best known victim: he ended his days in a mental institution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huntington's results from mutations in the gene which makes a protein called Huntingtin (Htt). The symptoms are associated with degeneration of various parts of the brain, most importantly, a deep region called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"&gt;the striatum&lt;/a&gt;. These facts have been known for many years, but it's unclear &lt;span&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; mutant Htt damages the brain. There are various theories, but they've all faced a serious puzzle - Htt is expressed in all adult human cells, but Huntington's only affects some neurones. Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A major new paper claims to have the answer :&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/5932/1327"&gt;Rhes, a Striatal Specific Protein, Mediates Mutant-Huntingtin Cytotoxicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/324/5932/1327"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; It also suggests a promising target for drugs that could prevent the damage from occuring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors assemble evidence showing that mutant Htt kills cells only in conjunction with another protein called Rhes. Crucially, Rhes is only expressed in striatal cells. They found that:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rhes binds to Htt, but it binds much more strongly to mutant Htt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Causing cells to express both Rhes and mutant Htt leads to cell death, but either by its own does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rhes mediates the binding of mutant Htt to another protein, SUMO, which causes the mutant Htt to become more soluble and therefore more toxic to cells.&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SmjM4n1zC-I/AAAAAAAAAcE/PihQz7L8Wcc/s1600-h/huntingtons.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:355px;height:364px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SmjM4n1zC-I/AAAAAAAAAcE/PihQz7L8Wcc/s400/huntingtons.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This looks to be a very important addition to the literature on Huntington's. The implication is that a drug which could prevent Rhes from SUMOylating mutant Htt would halt the progression of the disease (although it would presumably not reverse any damage which had already happened.) This is the kind of powerful explanation that neuroscientists who study psychiatric disorders dream about. Maybe in 50 years we will have a similar understanding of schizophrenia - maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huntington's is a fascinating disorder. The mechanism of inheritance is very distinctive - disease results when a certain section of DNA is too long, and the longer it is, the earlier and more severe the symptoms. And when the pathogenic region is too long, it tends to get even longer during the formation of sperm cells, so the children of fathers with Huntington's often suffer from a more severe, early-onset form. This phenemonon is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipation_%28genetics%29"&gt;genetic anticipation&lt;/a&gt; and is unique to Huntingdon's and some similar disorders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huntington's is also one of the few disorders which can be accurately diagnosed genetically before the symptoms occur. Anyone at risk of the disease can take a DNA test and know their fate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most choose not to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Science&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1126%2Fscience.1172871&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Rhes%2C+a+Striatal+Specific+Protein%2C+Mediates+Mutant-Huntingtin+Cytotoxicity&amp;amp;rft.issn=0036-8075&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=324&amp;amp;rft.issue=5932&amp;amp;rft.spage=1327&amp;amp;rft.epage=1330&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencemag.org%2Fcgi%2Fdoi%2F10.1126%2Fscience.1172871&amp;amp;rft.au=Subramaniam%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Sixt%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Barrow%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Snyder%2C+S.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CPsychology%2CHealth%2CNeuroscience"&gt;Subramaniam, S., Sixt, K., Barrow, R., &amp;amp; Snyder, S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow has invited art lovers to write their thoughts down in an open Bible on display as part of its Made in God's Image exhibition.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Next to the Bible lie several pens with a note saying: "If you feel you have been excluded from the Bible, please write your way back into it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting idea. I&amp;#39;ve signed a few bibles at people&amp;#39;s request myself — I usually mark up the first page with the question, &amp;quot;Where are the squid?&amp;quot; — so I like the sentiment that people ought to be free to comment on it. Some people, of course, are having the vapors over the fact that some scribblers say &lt;i&gt;very rude things&lt;/i&gt;. It comes with the territory, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's unsurprising stuff, really, but the last line of the article made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Catholic Church spokesman said: "One wonders whether the organisers would have been quite as willing to have the Koran defaced".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Derby in the UK, the City Council is planning to turn a former Viking village into a day center for adults on the autism spectrum. As reported in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/Target-date-autism-centre/article-1184323-detail/article.html"&gt;Derby Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;, plans are in the works to close two smaller centers and use the funds from selling them to renovate the Viking village. On the one hand, the opening of a new facility that might offer better options seems hopeful, but locating it in a site meant for tourists (and a "failed tourist attraction" at that) has some unpleasant connotations. Will the new facility be integrated into the surrounding community, or is it set apart and separate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in New Jersey, &lt;a href="http://www.drnj.org/"&gt;Disability Rights New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; is suing the New Jersey Department of Human Services on behalf of the family of a 41-year-old man who lives at the Hunterdon Developmental Center in Clinton, yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/07/disability_rights_group_sues_t.html"&gt;Star Ledger&lt;/a&gt; reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosamund and Daniel Caliendo of Hampton said they arrived at the Hunterdon Developmental Center in Clinton for a holiday party on Dec. 1, 2007, to find their son, Damian, in his electronic wheelchair facing a wall with the chair's front wheels suspended in the air and the tray table jabbed into his stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their son, who cannot speak and is diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a seizure disorder and other medical conditions that required neck surgery a year earlier, "was scared to death he was going to fall," his mother said. No one at the party came forward to explain what happened to Damian, who has lived at the institution for 30 years. The family believes an employee placed him in an unlawful restraint to punish him. They filed a complaint and demanded an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caliendos were only given a summary of the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be tearing my hair out if that was all I was told I could know about such a document regarding my son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the other other hand, it's possible that the new center in Derby might be better than alternatives. The July 20th &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/07/20/canada-report/4189/"&gt;Disability Scoop&lt;/a&gt; reported that some two dozen families in Canada have had to relinquish their parental rights and, in effect, make their children with severe disabilities wards of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got too long a way to go to figure out appropriate, safe, sufficiently staffed and well-supervised options for individuals with disabilities who need this care, and to make it clear, families and caretakers must be included in every way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248385277162"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/richard-dawkins-will-be-your-docent-today/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a00e4bd4df58793</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Richard Dawkins Will Be Your Docent Today</title><published>2009-07-23T20:42:02Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T20:42:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/richard-dawkins-will-be-your-docent-today/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sweet!

Claiming to treat the “underlying cause” of a condition raises the usual straw man argument that modern medicine does not, which of course is untrue. It also implies that there are underlying causes known to them and not to straights. FM claims to treat chronic disease which FM claims is inadequately treated by medicine.  FM claims to be a more advanced approach both in conceptual thinking and in practical management. Such claims are on the face doubtful, but hard to disprove. The way to find out would be to analyze cases they manage and critique them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to see specific examples of treatments but the web page text book links were not working at the time. I understand others have seen the contents and perhaps can add some information.   I sense a difference between “CAM” and FM – at least among the MDs and DOs -  is that FMers tend to use methods and substances with some degree of scientific or biochemical rationale, even if not proved, moreso than many of the CAMers.  Many seem to practice both systems or do not distinguish between the two systems.  In order to get a sense of the degree to which FM is known, I requested from the web page the names of practitioners in a 50 mile radius of my home (near Palo Alto, Calif.). The names ranged from Santa Cruz (40 miles) to Berkeley (50) and San Francosco (40) and Marin County (Sausalito – 50 miles) The population of that area is about 5 million. They sent 46 names:   MD/DO  31 – (including a nephrologist formerly on the staff of my teaching hospital)   PhD 1   DC 8   Lac 3   ND 2   RN 1   Because I had become aware of FM only 1-2 years ago, I thought 46 was a relatively large number.  The Web page lists four text books published in the past few years. A manuscript of the first one is available on line for downloading (not functioning when I tried.) .  21st Century Medicine: A New Model for Medical Education and PracticeMonograph Set – Functional Medicine Clinical Monograph Set – CME Available Textbook of Functional Medicine Clinical Nutrition: A Functional ApproachAs mentioned, I could not activate the links to those books, and did not have time to get to them individually.  No authors were listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following paragraph is part of the advertisement for the book set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of 21st century medicine from the prevailing acute-care model to a far more effective chronic-disease model will succeed only if we attack the underlying drivers of the epidemic – the complex lifelong interactions among lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FM also produces professional seminars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying Functional Medicine in Clinical Practice (AFMCP)™&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the AFMCP seminar  description: AFMCP is not a typical medical meeting.  Now in its 12th year, this five-day course has been rigorously designed, critically evaluated, and continuously refined by our outstanding core faculty, each of whom brings diverse and subject-specific clinical expertise to the application of functional medicine.  AFMCP is a well-orchestrated, comprehensive, patient-centered educational program that helps you deepen your clinical understanding and practical application of the Functional Medicine Matrix Model as applied to:&lt;/p&gt;

Interested people.  The Institute for Functional Medicine was apparently founded by Jeffrey Bland, PhD. For simplicity, here is reproduced his section from quackwatch.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey S. Bland, Ph.D., of Gig Harbor, Washington, has been one of the health-food industry’s most prolific interpreters of nutrition-related scientific developments. His interpretations consistently favor the use of supplements. A former chemistry professor, he has appeared frequently at trade shows [1], written and edited publications, produced audio and video tapes, and conducted seminars for health professionals. He has also been a research associate at the Linus Pauling Institute of Medicine and has directed its nutrient analysis laboratory.  In 1991, the FTC charged that Bland and two of his corporations (HealthComm and Nu-Day Enterprises) had falsely claimed that their diet program could cause weight loss by changing consumers’ metabolism and cause them to lose weight without exercising so that fat is lost as body heat instead of being stored. The Nu-Day Diet Program, which cost about $30 per week, included instructional materials, a meal-replacement formula, and a fiber-containing formula said to be a “natural appetite suppressant.” The Nu-Day program was promoted with a 30-minute television program entitled “The Perfect Diet,” which offered “amazing true stories of people like yourself losing 20, 30, 50 pounds or more, safely, quickly and naturally.” Although the television program appeared to be an independent consumer news show that used interviews to report on its discovery of the Nu-Day Diet, it was actually a paid ad. The program identified Bland as “one of the nation’s leading nutritional biochemists.” The case was settled with a consent agreement in which Bland agreed to pay $30,000 for redress and to refrain from making the claims that had been challenged. The consent order also requires future programs of 15 minutes or longer to display messages identifying them as paid ads for the products offered [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, the FTC charged Bland and his companies with violating the consent order by making unsubstantiated weight-loss claims for several products. In addition, their UltraClear dietary program had been falsely claimed to reduce the incidence and severity of symptoms associated with gastrointestinal problems, inflammatory or immunologic problems, fatigue, food allergies, mercury exposure, kidney disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis. The settlement agreement included a $45,000 civil penalty [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, Natural Foods Merchandiser reported that HealthComm had acquired a minority interest in Keats Publishing of New Canaan, Connecticut, and that Bland had joined its board of directors. Keats has probably been America’s most prolific publisher of questionable information about health, nutrition, and “alternative” health methods. Established in 1971, it has issued more than 400 books, of which over 200 are still in print. It has also published more than 100 “Good Health Guides,” most of which promote the types of products sold through health-food stores. In 1999, HealthComm sold its interest in Keats publishing to the Chicago Sun-Times [4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, Bland founded the Institute for Functional Medicine, a HealthComm division that oversaw the company’s web site, develops educational products, and sponsors an annual International Symposium on Functional Medicine. In 1997, he invited practitioners to join him on the Functional Medicine Section of CompuServe’s Natural Medicine Forum, which HealthComm co-sponsored. Brochures accompanying the invitation stated that the company’s UltraClear Plus “provides nutritional support for pathological or imbalanced detoxifiers and may be suitable for patients with” chronic fatigue syndrome; chemical and environmental sensitivity; alcohol and chemical dependency; food allergy; “management of endo- and exotoxicity”; and arthralgia and myalgia. The Web site has carried similar claims that I consider improper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC and FDA have since 1995 ordered several other Bland-associated companies to cease false advertising.  A Medline search over the past 2 years showed about six Bland-authored articles, mainly published in secondary nutrition journals and in Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. Most were reviews, some actually trials or surveys.  Mark Hyman MD has his institute in Lennox, Mass.  His website shows about ten books, four on “Ultra-Mind, two on “Ultra-Metabolism”, then “Ultra-Nutrition”.  His approach largely is dietary with supplements, plus avoiding “toxins” in the environment. One lecture is about intestinal toxicity. I assume heavy metals are in that bunch.  I listened to several FM doc radio programs and Hyman is held I high regard in that circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others: I mentioned a nephrologists from my former teaching faculty. He took an unusual route.  A competent subspecialist in a technical field, he began an interest in “alternative medicine” 15 years ago, left his position, and set up an internal medicine practice specializing in chronic diseases and seemed to attract people with functional disorders (better, dysfunctional ones.)  I assumed that technical medicine such as running dialysis units and personnel became burdensome,  and that he felt his efforts might be appreciated better by medicine’s chronic complaining rejects.  At least that was my impression at the time. I never got to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another FM practitioner is a physician in a nearby small community who has a local radio program (“Ask Dr. Dawn.”)  This physician seems well grounded in biological science, speaks well, and explains complex matters in simple analogies that the audience can understand. In that capacity she performs a social service for the community. But I find hard to understand her affinity for recommending unproved and often implausible treatments such as “pro-biotics” for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and acupuncture when all else fails (she is a graduate of the UCLA post-grad acupuncture course.) I am trying to form a general explanation for why physicians become involved in such off-the-trail health schemes like FM.  So far as I can sense, most feel they are doing the right thing, filling a social and medical gap ignored by “the system” because it’s not where the money and fame are. I detect a great amount of resentment toward the “system” and against their straight colleagues as well. Net entry I will record a typical Q&amp;amp;A radio segment that may illustrate how FMers perceive disease, medicine and their roles.&lt;/p&gt;

We gained and confirmed a new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1919_einste.php"&gt;theory of gravity&lt;/a&gt;; we learned how &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1950s_the_t.php"&gt;all the elements&lt;/a&gt; in the Universe were made.  We &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe.php"&gt;detected neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; from an exploding star hundreds of thousands of light years away.  And &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php"&gt;we walked on the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, while wherever possible, I've tried to give credit to the individuals who've bore the most responsibility for these advances, the truth is that -- for almost all of these advances -- there are tremendous teams of unsung people behind nearly all of them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/missioncontrol1969.jpg" width="500" alt="missioncontrol1969.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This century, nearly all of the great satellites, observatories, computer simulations  and experiments that are returning tremendous amounts of scientific data about the Universe -- from our own Solar System to the farthest reaches of space -- are run by huge teams of scientists, not just a few individuals.  So for the greatest discovery of the 2000s, I choose the most important satellite, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_Microwave_Anisotropy_Probe"&gt;Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe&lt;/a&gt;, or WMAP.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/990293_544B.jpg" width="500" alt="990293_544B.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WMAP is pretty simple: it's a telescope designed to observe microwave light from two different points in the sky at the same time.  We can use it to map the entire sky.  Why is this important?  Here's the problem: right after the big bang, the Universe was hot, dense, expanding, and very, very &lt;i&gt;smooth&lt;/i&gt;.  Let me show you what I mean.  The Earth is a sphere, but -- of course -- I can't show you a sphere with just two dimensions.  So we make a projection.  Ideally, I'd like to show you a map that has the right area for all of the continents and bodies of water, unlike the &lt;a href="http://www.culturaldetective.com/images/Mercator.gif"&gt;Mercator projection&lt;/a&gt; you're used to.  So I can make a map like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/800px-Mollweide-projection.jpg" width="500" alt="800px-Mollweide-projection.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty good!  If we look at the heavens, in the optical and infrared, and map out where everything is, we can get a map of the sky!  That big thing in the middle is our galaxy, but all the other stuff is made from the other galaxies we find in the Universe.  This is a fantastic picture, so &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/lss_2mass_big.jpg"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for the full resolution version:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/lss_2mass_big.jpg" width="500" alt="lss_2mass_big.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice, as you might expect, that galaxies are clumped together in groups.  This is a picture of the Universe today, when it's 13.7 billion years old.  Well, the &lt;i&gt;microwave&lt;/i&gt; sky is, as you might remember, is the leftover glow from the Big Bang.  But it's a very special relic from the past, because it &lt;b&gt;hasn't changed since the Universe was only 380,000 years old!&lt;/b&gt;  So when we see the microwave sky, we see the Universe as it was when it was only in its infancy.  What did it look like back then?  Well, from 1964 to 1979, we knew it looked like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/monopole.gif" width="500" alt="monopole.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, crap.  That can't be right.  What we &lt;i&gt;saw&lt;/i&gt; is that it was the same exact temperature -- 3 Kelvin -- everywhere.  In the early Universe, though, &lt;b&gt;temperature is related to density&lt;/b&gt;.  If it's the same temperature everywhere, then it's the same density everywhere.  But if it were &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; the same density everywhere, we would have clusters of galaxies in some places and absolutely nothing in others.  In other words, there must be differences in density (and hence in temperature) to give rise to the Universe we see today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1979, we discovered that one side of the sky is hotter than the other, if only by a few thousandths of a degree.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/dipole-s.jpg" width="500" alt="dipole-s.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just means that we're &lt;i&gt;moving&lt;/i&gt; relative to the Hubble flow (i.e., expansion) of the Universe, at a few hundred kilometers per second.  Where did all of these seeds for structure come from, though?  In the 1990s, the COBE satellite gave us a hint, showing us differences of a few hundred-thousandths of a degree:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/cobe_cmb.png" width="500" alt="cobe_cmb.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was pretty low-resolution.  WMAP came along, and here's what the microwave sky (with the galaxy removed) looks like today, because of this satellite.  (It's a huge image, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/080997_5yrFullSky_WMAP_2048W.png"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for the full resolution version!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a/080997_5yrFullSky_WMAP_2048W.png" width="512" alt="080997_5yrFullSky_WMAP_2048W.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... umm... wow.  The stars, galaxies, and all the structure in the Universe that we have today came about because of fluctuations just a few &lt;b&gt;hundred-thousandths&lt;/b&gt; of a degree in the early Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science that came out of WMAP was also unprecedented for cosmology, allowing us to determine that, among other things, the Universe is:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less than 5% normal matter (protons, neutrons, and electrons),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made up of about 22% dark matter,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which isn't neutrinos (at least in the conventional sense),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and about 74% dark energy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spatially flat (as opposed to closed or open),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and has been transparent to visible light only since a redshift of 10 or so, among other things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
There are many other interesting science discoveries that came out of WMAP, but it really helped cement our picture of the Universe &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; precisely measured a number of incredibly interesting things for the first time.  And that makes it the most important discovery of the last decade for me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed the series!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_the_2000s_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248384707606"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/silence_of_the_muffins.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f7217cf0bce99303</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Silence of the muffins.</title><published>2009-07-23T21:40:27Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T21:40:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/IxvUjAM-8Hc/silence_of_the_muffins.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/silence_of_the_muffins.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/07/the-man-in-the-red-shirt/"&gt;red shirted man&lt;/a&gt; making deals on the phone as he paces back and forth.  There is no group of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_loudness_of_coffee_shops.php"&gt;large voiced church people&lt;/a&gt; being all holier than thou.  And loud.  Eight out of ten customers in this coffee shop are writers.  I can tell because they come in and sit down and write, either on a laptop or on paper.  The other two out of ten are artists or book binders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other clue to the livelihood of the clientèle is that this is a coffee shop in a writer's workshop, where writers go to teach and take classes and stuff, attached to an art gallery and a book binding shop.  I'm here because my daughter is taking a class and it is a lot easier to hang here and work in the coffee shop than to drive home and back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none of that is important.   The reason I bring this up at all is the following: The espresso/cappuccino machine is NOT an automatic machine.  The milk is foamed with a foamer.  The espresso is made through one of those standard espresso thingies that needs to be banged to clean out.  And so on.  So, even though one can explain the relative quietness of coffee shops in general using the technology (automatic = not as good espresso but much quieter process) it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to be non-automatic and quiet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why quiet here? This is a writer's loft.  The place is full of people like me. They probably all have blogs.  If the guy working here, who incidentally has a pretty good Elvis imitation going, bangs the espresso thingie or shshhhes the milk too loudly, then a dozen blog posts complaining about it go out over the intertubes that second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a folded towel set next to a tiny sink into which the spent grounds are placed.  If you hold the espresso holder in your palm (instead of by the handle) and whack it smartly against the towel at the edge of the sink ... once .... most of the grounds go into the sink.   Quietly.  Then you rinse it out.  I know this because I positioned myself in a place where I could watch the process.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire latte making process is quiet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The muffins. They are silent.  &lt;/p&gt;

Real medicine has &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws"&gt;a Clarkeian quality &lt;/a&gt;to it*; it’s so successful, it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like magic.  But real doctors know that there is nothing magic about it.  The “magic” is based on hard work, sound scientific principles, and years of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic words are great. Terms like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/medicine_and_belief_part_n1.php"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/i_do_not_think_it_means_what_y.php"&gt;functional medicine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/06/hey_fake_autism_experts---put.php"&gt;endocrine disruptors&lt;/a&gt; take a complicated problem and create a simple but false answer with no real data to back it up. More often than not, the magic word is the invention of a single person who had a really interesting idea, but lacked the intellectual capacity or honesty to flesh it out.  Magic is, ultimately, a lie of sorts.  As TAM 7 demonstrates, many magicians are skeptics, and vice versa.  In interviews, magicians will often say that they came to skepticism when the learned just how easy it is to deceive people.  Magic words in alternative medicine aren’t sleight-of-hand, but sleight-of-mind, playing on people’s hopes and fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader has turned me on to another magic word I hadn’t known about.  It’s called the “Inflammation Factor”, and is the invention of a nutritionist named Monica Reinagel.  Like most good lies, this one builds on a nidus of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a medical term that refers to a host of complex physiologic processes mediated by the immune system.  Inflammation gets its ancient name from the obvious physical signs of inflammation: &lt;em&gt;rubor, calor, dolor, tumor&lt;/em&gt;, or redness, heat, pain, and swelling.  As the vitalistic ancient medical beliefs bowed to modern science, inflammation was recognized to be far more complex than just these four external characteristics.  In addition to being a response to injury and disease, the cellular and chemical responses of inflammation can cause disease.  For example, in asthma and food allergies, a type of immune reaction called &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/allergies_of_the_first_kindtyp.php"&gt;type I hypersensitivity&lt;/a&gt; elicits a harmful type of inflammation.  Coronary heart disease, the biggest killer of Americans, is believed to have &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/352/16/1685"&gt;a significant inflammatory component&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing in medicine is perfectly simple.  For example, corticosteroids, which can be used effectively to treat the inflammation in asthma are not effective against the inflammation in cororary heart disease.  It’s just not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while inflammation may not be that simple, people can be.   People want easy answers, and quacks are happy to step in to provide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Ms Reinagel &lt;a href="http://inflammationfactor.com/faqs.php"&gt;has invented a diet&lt;/a&gt;, available for sale in a book called &lt;em&gt;The Inflammation Free Diet Plan&lt;/em&gt;.  Her premise is that inflammation is at the root of all major diseases, and that your diet can affect inflammation, thereby improving your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the hypothesis is intriguing, each step of the argument has problems, leading to an invalid conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is the root of all disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not.  “Inflammation”, which is actually refers to a lot of different processes, plays an important role in many diseases.  But not all inflammation is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important factor in fighting inflammation is the food you eat every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, no.  If you have a staph infection on your arm, your eating habits will not change the amount of heat, pain, swelling, or redness.  The kernel of truth here is that diet can affect various measures of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (&lt;a href="http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/1/152"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is one of many examples). There’s a long leap between this fact and the conclusion that diet can “stop inflammation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of reducing inflammation are immediate as well as long term. You’ll notice that your skin looks younger, your joints feel better, and your allergy symptoms improve. At the same time, when you reduce inflammation, you also reduce your risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, and other complications of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very long walk from the claim that reducing inflammation is “a good thing” to proving that your particular diet reduces inflammation and thereby improves health .  A hypothesis is not true simply because it sounds pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t love a magic book that would prevent and cure all illness?  Perhaps you’ve noticed that these books come along every few months.  None of them ever has the one true answer.  Life is much more complicated and beautiful than any magic book.  It may be a lot more difficult to commit science than to commit quackery, but in the end it’s a lot more satisfying and a lot more useful.&lt;/p&gt;

In the post, I conveyed that this falsification was very bad indeed, and examined some of the harm it caused.  I also noted that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) meted out somewhat different penalties to the principal investigator (ten year voluntary exclusion from government funding and from serving in any advisory capacity with the PHS) and to her postdoc (three year voluntary exclusion from government funding and PHS advisory roles).  Moreover, UAB had left open the possibility that the postdoc might work on other people's research projects under very strict mentoring.  (Owing to the ORI ruling, these research projects would have to be ones funded by someone other than the U.S. government, however.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that post, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/university_of_alabama_research.php#comment-1791576"&gt;commenter Paul Browne disagreed with my suggestion&lt;/a&gt; that rehabilitation of the postdoc in this case might be an end worth seeking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"While such an obvious departure from an experimental protocol -- especially an in an experiment involving animal use -- isn't much of an ethical gray area, I think there's something to be said for treating early-career scientists as potentially redeemable in the aftermath of such ethical screw-ups."

&lt;p&gt;You have got to be kidding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not talking about an honest mistake, or deviating from an approved protocol with the best of intentions, or excluding a few outliers from the analysis but rather a decade of repeatedly lying to their funders, their IACUC and to other scientists working in their field.&lt;br&gt;
What they did almost makes me wish that science has a ceremony similar to the old military drumming out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least they should both be charged with fraud, and since they presumably included their previous falsified results in support of NIH grant applications it shouldn't be too hard to get a conviction.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, I understand where Paul is coming from.  Given the harm that cheaters can do to the body of shared knowledge on which the scientific community relies, and to the trust within the scientific community that makes coordination of effort possible, I understand the impulse to remove cheaters from the community once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this impulse raises a big question: Can a scientist who has made an ethical misstep be rehabilitated and reintegrated as a productive member of the scientific community?  Or is your first ethical blunder grounds for permanent expulsion from the community?  In practice, this isn't just a question about the person who commits the ethical violation.  It's also a question about what other scientists in the community can stomach in dealing with the offenders -- especially when the offender turns out to be a close colleague or a trainee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/tempering_justice_with_mercy_t.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/tempering_justice_with_mercy_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/UOyhCx85raQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248382083661"><id gr:original-id="http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/what-to-beetles-cuttlefish-and-orangutans-all-have-in-common/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b558de727d7bf753</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">What to beetles, cuttlefish, and orangutans all have in common?</title><published>2009-07-23T14:24:56Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T14:24:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/2nwxYpCFkZY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/what-to-beetles-cuttlefish-and-orangutans-all-have-in-common/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Alternative mating strategies!
When we learn about sexual selection theory, we usually learn about it as a binary system:  Females choose males, and males try to be chosen.

It is true this wins him few converts, when a collaboration with religious moderates against the creationists might bear weightier fruit. But if his intellectual rigour forbids him making common cause with people he thinks are wrong, that perhaps only shows he is indeed the rottweiler of legend.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hear hear.  What the "militant accomodationists" (heh) like Mooney are failing to understand is that it doesn't even &lt;i&gt;matter&lt;/i&gt; whether pragmatism recommends a strategy of accomodation.  While certainly there are many disparate voices in the non-accomodationist side, the one thing they all have in common is that they refuse to say something they think is plainly untrue in order to further a political purpose.  We can &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik"&gt;debate how realistic&lt;/a&gt; it is to take such a principled stand, but to act like it is somehow &lt;i&gt;unreasonable&lt;/i&gt; to feel that way... that's just crazy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accomodationists should just come out and admit it:  They want us to &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,2394,Lying-for-Jesus,Richard-Dawkins"&gt;Lie For Science&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/strong&gt; recently made the following &lt;a href="http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/celebrity-gossip/2009/07/22/brad-pitt-interview/inglourious-basterd-star-on-angelina-jolie-and-six-kids.html"&gt;comments about religion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;BILD&lt;/em&gt; (a German newspaper):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BILD&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you believe in God?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/strong&gt; (smiling): “No, no, no!”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BILD&lt;/strong&gt;: Is your soul spiritual?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/strong&gt;: “No, no, no! I’m probably 20 per cent atheist and 80 per cent agnostic. I don’t think anyone really knows. You’ll either find out or not when you get there, until then there’s no point thinking about it
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_theistic_probability#Dawkins.27_formulation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;‘ spectrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029LHWHM?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0029LHWHM"&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, where 1 represents 100% belief that God exists and 7 represents 100% certainty God doesn’t exist, Brad Pitt’s atheism would presumably be at a 6 (where Dawkins is) and his agnosticism would be at a 4 (right in the middle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some math…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(0.2 x 6) + (0.8 x 4)….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry the 2… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the 4… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Brad Pitt pegged at a 4.4 on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not quite in our camp… but we’ll take him!&lt;/p&gt;

One thing I’ve leaned over the years is that the Universe goes on, even if you’re at Comic Con.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I think we can say beyond any reasonable doubt that Jupiter suffered a major impact recently. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/19/new-black-spot-on-jupiter/"&gt;I was wary at first&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/20/yup-jupiter-got-served/"&gt;still wavering a bit&lt;/a&gt; even later, but now there’s no question at all. Why? &lt;a href="http://www.gemini.edu/node/11300"&gt;Because of this image from the giant Gemini North telescope&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bang! We’re done arguing. This image was taken at 18 microns, well out into the infrared where what you’re basically seeing is heat. There are spots and things on Jupiter’s cloud tops that are visible, but the impact feature in the center of the frame is obvious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/album/entire/pr1994036a/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/hst_sl9_scar.jpg" alt="Hubble image of SL9 impact scar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m so sure now is that this looks almost exactly like the images returned after the comet Shoemaker Levy 9 broke into dozens of pieces and repeatedly slammed into Jupiter 15 years ago. Here’s a Hubble image (right) of that event for comparison. You can see the the splash pattern is just the same, indicating the trajectory of the incoming debris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have asked how you can get a feature like this when Jupiter has no solid surface. That’s a fair question! The impactor is probably a chunk of rock or ice a mile or so across. It’s moving very quickly, probably at 100 or so km/sec (60 miles/second). That gives it a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; amount of kinetic energy, that is, energy of motion. Still, as it passes through the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, where gas is thin, not much happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as it drops down the air gets thicker, and at those speeds the pressure on the incoming rock is enormous. As the gas in front of the meteor compresses, it heats up a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;, the same way a bicycle pump heats up when you use it. But in this case the gas gets heated to thousands of degrees, and glows. The pressure on the rock starts to flatten it out (scientists call this &amp;quot;pancaking&amp;quot;). The rock starts to break up, and then each one of those pieces compress and heats the air in front of it, pancakes, and breaks up, forming even smaller pieces, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a few seconds, this cascades into a vast amount of energy released essentially all at once. That is what scientists call &amp;quot;a whopping big explosion&amp;quot; (sorry to get technical on you here). So you don’t need a physical impact with solid ground to get a detonation, you just need lots of pressure, and that’s easy to come by with Jupiter and things falling on it from space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why we see this huge impact scar. The explosion vaporized the incoming rock, and that debris blasted upward and rained down on the cloud tops, discoloring them. It also carved out a giant hole in the clouds, revealing lower atmospheric layers in early pictures, and blasted up material from lower down as well. This debris can float on the cloudtops for weeks and months, which is what happened in 1994 with SL9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot more details about all this &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;in the first chapter of my book&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that this event was spotted after it was all over and all that was left in the visible light images was a black spot… and also remember that this was spotted by an amateur astronomer! Astronomy is one of the few fields where unpaid but extremely capable people can make a huge (no, I won’t say &amp;quot;impact&amp;quot;) contribution. Congrats to everyone involved for catching this rare event early enough to make more observations and detailed scientific analysis possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad reasoning is a very broad term and there are a very large number of factors contributing to the generally atrocious reasoning ability our society has.  Some of these I think are worth faulting individuals for, some are probably more appropriately blamed on our education system.  What is important about this is that the big picture here is not religion.  It’s people being too intellectually lazy to care whether their ideas make sense or are supported by evidence.  It’s people not knowing how to form a logical argument, or how to recognize an illogical one.  It’s people not understanding the fallibility of our own minds, our own memory, and our own senses.  It’s people not understanding the idea of falsifiability and testing a hypothesis.  It’s people not knowing the very basics of what scientists have discovered about our universe.  It’s people seeing a fraction and thinking “oh well I don’t need to understand that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the big problems.  They affect people’s beliefs far more broadly than just their belief in religion.  They are the cause of the success of countless quack medicines and perpetual energy machines.  They are the reason we have people who believe Barack Obama was born in Kenya, or that we never went to the Moon.  They are the reason that our political discussions are so often focused on vague, general and untested claims.  I hate all of these things, and fixing them isn’t a question of arguing each point, it’s teaching people how to figure out for themselves that these ideas are stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get yelled at, I dont’ think it’s a bad thing to fight religion directly.  Religion is a symptom, sometimes a terrible symptom, of the problems listed above, and I have no problem with people trying to relieve such symptoms.  I think good will probably come from the raised profile of atheism and from convincing some people that their beliefs are unfounded and likely wrong.  I even think that religion can be a good medium in which to discuss at least some of the problems listed above.  But it’s not enough.  A world full of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/is_bill_maher_really_that_ignorant_part.php"&gt;Bill Maher’s&lt;/a&gt; is not that much better than a world full of &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29734328/"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI’s&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s a little better, but there’s still some work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural question is, of course, how do we do this?  I think a lot can be done by simply asking questions.  The idea of falsifiability, logical fallacies and intellectual laziness can be directly fought simply by questioning people who make claims (even claims that are true).  That’s what we can do every day on an individual basis, but I don’t think that is enough.  Most people have no understanding of the scientific method when they graduate high school.  I didn’t have a good understanding of the scientific method until after that.  That needs to have a much larger emphasis in school than it does, rather than focusing on fitting in as many facts as possible.  Facts are important to know, but they are disproportionately weighted in our current system thanks to our testing and teacher evaluation systems.  All high schoolers should also be required to take statistics, calculus can wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with making education reform suggestions is that it’s one thing to say “we need to teach the scientific method better,” and another thing to actually get that to happen.  Teaching concepts and ways of thinking take a lot more work than teaching facts.  It takes a lot more work from the teacher, and it takes an evaluation system that it different than our current one.  These are broad scale reforms that will take a lot of time and a lot of work to implement, but it’s what needs to be done.  I don’t think we can fight the rampant problems in thinking in our society without education reform.  Just remember that it’s not what is taught that is important, it’s how it’s taught.  That’s incredibly hard to change because it involves changes at the individual teacher level.  Some of it could be achieved through changes in evaluation methods (a portfolio method like the &lt;a href="http://www.ibo.org/"&gt;IB&lt;/a&gt; does is one such option), but some of it involves better teacher training, and better incentives for teachers to care.  There are still more difficulties, one being that we need LOTS of teachers, and it’s very hard to find that many people good at anything.  Education is a terribly complicated field, but it’s important and worth trying to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this is a complicated issue, and doesn’t have one, two or twenty-nine easy solutions.  The real point is to see what the big picture is and decide what you want to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

And of course racism (and race relations) is an extremely important issue, and one that should indeed be addressed, whether related to law enforcement or otherwise. But I’m wondering about this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick bullet points from the police report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cambridge, Mass. police were alerted to a possible break-in at Gates’ home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gates answered the door when police arrived, and when informed of the investigation of a possible break-in, initially refused to provide identification, saying to the officer, “Why, because I’m a black man in America?”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gates finally provided a Harvard ID that showed it was in fact his home, but police were confused by his behavior, and asked him to step outside the residence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upset by the request, Gates yelled at the investigating officer repeatedly, first inside the residence, and then followed the officer outside, where Gates continued to upbraid him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gates was arrested for “loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space” . (He was subsequently released and the charges were dropped.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you have handled the incident if you were the cops? If you were Gates? Is this really a case of racism or racial profiling, or simply a case of police arresting a guy for being an obnoxious dick in public? Do you think there is a general tendency among traditionally oppressed minorities to find racism where there is none?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That Retts "takes the souls" of girls.  The researcher said this without malice; in fact, I had the strong sense that he felt this description was in some way compassionate.  When it was recommended to him by another researcher who does a lot of work directly in collaboration with the disability community (not me though I was sure thinking it) that he might want to meet some real girls with Retts to see that they do, in fact, have souls, he related how meeting the father of someone with Retts is what inspired him in his mission to return these girls' souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relating this to a friend later, my friend asked, "did he really mean that literally, like a religious thing?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've no way to know for sure of course, but my suspicion is that it wasn't a religious thing; that the word "soul" was more likely being used as a synonym for "personhood" or "humanity" or "that which makes a person a person." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mix of souls with science harkens back to the ages before a separation between the mystical and the scientific.  But there's a more recent dark ages involving lack of understanding, inclusion, or respect for people with disabilities in discourse about their own lives.  Of viewing people with disabilities as broken things, and not as human beings.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Renaissance may be here, we're still not fully out of those dark ages, or else the term "soulless" would be as abhorrent when applied to someone with Retts as it currently is applied to someone from a minority racial or ethnic background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased direct involvement of the disability community in research is one way to start lighting this darkness; however, it's hard to motivate people to become involved when they are labeled in disparaging ways like "soulless."  I know I certainly wouldn't participate in any sort of research--not as a participant and not as a colleague--from someone who feels that Retts "steals souls."  Something else, or more, or just different may be required to bootstrap some segments of the research community into a more modern paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248376120253"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=15397">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/74d5cf120a19070f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="hip hop"/><category term="Iran"/><title type="html">Hip Hop School of Int'l Politics</title><published>2009-07-23T17:55:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T17:55:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/hip-hop-school-of-intl-politics/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Do you have trouble making sense of &lt;a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65123/mohsen-m-milani/tehrans-take"&gt;U.S./Iranian relations&lt;/a&gt;?

This is an exciting area of research. On the one hand researchers are trying to model the working of a mammalian brain, eventually a human brain, down to the tiniest detail. On the other, researchers are also trying to build an AI – either in hardware or virtually in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle are attempts at interfacing brains and computer chips. Remember the monkeys who can move robot arms with their minds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these efforts are synergistic – modeling the mammalian brain will help AI researchers build their AI, and building AI computers and applications can teach us about brain function. The more we learn about both, the easier it will be to interface them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is very difficult to say how far away specific milestones and applications are on all these fronts. Progress is steady and promising, but predicting the future is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has not stopped &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8164060.stm"&gt;Henry Markram from predicting&lt;/a&gt; at the current TED Global Conference that we can have a virtual model of the human brain in 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not impossible to build a human brain and we can do it in 10 years,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And if we do succeed, we will send a hologram to TED to talk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope he’s right – that would be a huge milestone. Markram works on the Blue Brain project, and right now they have managed to build a virtual model of a rat cortical column. This simulates about 10,000 neurons. Markram says that each neuron requires the processing power of a laptop to model, so they use an IBM Bluegene machine which has 10,000 processors. This is definitely not a desktop application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just one cortical column. Modelling the entire brain would require 100 billion neurons – that gives you an idea of the processing power of the human brain. That’s 10 million supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that hardware is going to be the biggest limiting factor on Markram’s prediction. If we assume Moore’s Law of doubling processor power every 18 months, then it will take 36 years for supercomputers to exceed the power of 100 billion neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, simulating virtual neurons requires much more processing power than building artifical neurons directly – building a massively parallel processor to duplicate a brain in hardware, rather than creating a virtual brain. But that is also hard to predict because it requires the development of new hardware – not just software and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I share Markram’s enthusiasm for this technology, and his optimism that all the components will eventually come into place (modeling the human brain and developing fast enough computers) – 10 years seems to be pushing it. I hope to be proven wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248374033675"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=4170">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7a2f646c76dbb7b5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Science"/><category term="beetles"/><category term="dung"/><category term="kleptoparasitism"/><title type="html">Fossil Dung Balls</title><published>2009-07-23T17:02:57Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T17:02:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/fossil-dung-balls/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, very busy, but I had to write this, just for the post title.  From a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090716093524.htm"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2009/07/090716093524-large.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="fossildungball" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/fossildungball.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=112" alt="photo by Victoria Sánchez" width="150" height="112"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo by Victoria Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A new study of 30-million-year-old-fossil ‘mega-dung’ from extinct giant South American mammals, published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palaeontology, reveals evidence of complex ecological interactions and theft of dung-beetles’ food stores by other animals….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some 30 million years ago, the continent was home to what is known to palaeontologists as the South America Megafauna, including some truly giant extinct herbivores: bone covered armadillos the size of a small car, ground sloths 6 metres tall and elephant-sized hoofed-mammals unlike anything alive today. And of course, megafauna would have produced mega-dung.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;strong&gt;Mega-dung&lt;/strong&gt;.  I love science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper itself is actually about the activities of &lt;em&gt;kleptoparasites&lt;/em&gt;, which, as you might infer from the name, is parasitism by theft. In other words, one animal steals prey (turds) from another animal (dung beetles) and uses it for its own purposes. In this case, flies and other dung beetles were the thieves; earthworms seem to have also found fertile grounds in the dung balls as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, what are the dung balls for? You’ve probably seen the videos–the beetles harvest dung pies for a nice little food source to lay eggs on.  The narration on this video is a bit twee, but the video is very nice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FBI and IRS agents arrested most of the suspects Thursday morning in what is being described as one of the biggest investigations of its kind in New Jersey history, according to NBC affiliate WNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The leaks are similar to each other in position and therefore in likely cause.  Unfortunately, these leaks are in already chilled down parts of the LHC and they will have to be warmed up to make repairs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delay will probably be a couple of weeks, so a planned (hoped for) October startup will now likely be mid November.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery Channel &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/07/23/discovery-channel-plays-creation-museum-ad/"&gt;ran an ad&lt;/a&gt; for the Creation Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or to put it another way: A science channel ran an ad that said the programming on that channel tells you lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/07/23/discovery-channel-plays-creation-museum-ad/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Florien&lt;/strong&gt; explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Recently, one of our readers was watching Extreme Machines on the Science Channel with his son. The inevitable ads came on — and he saw an advertisement for the Creation Museum, the anti-science young-earth creationist museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps next month we’ll start seeing ads for the Flat Earth Society on their channels. Or maybe public service announcements on how children shouldn’t be immunized.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this is a corporate commerical — one that Discovery had nothing to do with — but it’s still disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did someone not notice the conflict?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is FOXNews about to purchase a commercial spot on MSNBC?&lt;/p&gt;

Bats! On the ground!

Before humans arrived on New Zealand, the only mammals living there were bat species. One of only two remaining native Kiwi mammals is Mystacina tuberculata, the lesser short-tailed bat.

This bat’s second claim to fame is that it walks. Only one other bat, the vampire bat, does this, and vampire bats don’t spend anywhere near the same amount of time on the ground as M. tuberculata does. That there are no other land mammals in New Zealand has been suggested as a reason that these bats are such ground huggers. This was suggested by analogy with birds, which are often flightless on islands that don’t have large predators. Indeed, New Zealand provides an example here with the kakapo, which Douglas Adams famously described as the world’s largest and least able to fly parrot....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Then, we realized that in the scientific community guinea pigs have a special history, a centuries-old relationship.   It's a little known tale of love, loss, and even triumph.   So here it is: the true guinea pig, selfless helper of humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither a pig nor from Guinea, these strange rodents evolved to maximum cuteness in the Andes.  They immediately became popular as household pets upon their introduction to Europeans in the 16th century due to their relative low maintenance, good looks, and easy temperament - in other words: their high threshold for being abused by children without seeking revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Smd9ixU7jiI/AAAAAAAAADs/evec6B5O6Io/s1600-h/300px-Guinea_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:300px;height:225px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Smd9ixU7jiI/AAAAAAAAADs/evec6B5O6Io/s320/300px-Guinea_1.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The use of guinea pigs as, well, guinea pigs in laboratories began in the the 17th century, when they  played a significant role in several major discoveries.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur"&gt;Louis Pasteur&lt;/a&gt; made use of them in establishing germ theory on his way to co-founding the field of microbiology.   Guinea pigs also helped fuel research that lead to a better understanding of anatomy and the way mammals burn calories.  Years later, they were made into some of the world's first astronauts when the USSR launched them into orbit in the early 1960s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While their popularity today in scientific research has waned in favor of rats and mice, guinea pigs are still used in the development of anti-virals, vaccines, and also as simulators of the human body's reaction to several major diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, maybe guinea pigs don't need to wield a machine gun, drive a motorized ball like a race car,   or have latest spy gadgetry to be considered heroes.  The next time you find yourself face to face with one of these little guys, consider shaking a paw and saying a simple, "thanks" - though we hear they may appreciate an alfalfa pellet more than your sincere gratitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7GaEZ2e9Ijs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7435362281996589641?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I sympathize; Maher certainly has some wacky ideas, and I even gave him a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/desperate_space_filler_oscars.php"&gt;mixed review on his movie, &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (I also must repeat a clarification: the Richard Dawkins Award is not given by Richard Dawkins or the Richard Dawkins Foundation: it is an award by Atheist Alliance International, named after Richard Dawkins.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, let's be clear about the obvious. He is being given this award for making a movie this year that clearly promotes atheism and mocks religion, and that's all that is being endorsed. Not many people have done that, and it's especially unusual in that it was a movie &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; about ridiculing religion, and it was a mainstream movie with wide circulation. That's it. It would be difficult to ignore, and it's something AAI would like to promote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be clear about something else. This is atheism: we have no dogma, we have no infallible leaders, everyone is naturally flawed, and we recognize that within our ranks there is a huge diversity of opinion. Our strategy for dealing with these ideas is the same as the scientific approach — constant, relentless criticism. There is no Atheist Supreme Leader. There is no Atheist Pope. There is no Godless Ruling Council, no Atheist Inquisition, no Freethought Dogma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means, of course, is that it is open season on everything and everyone. Everyone going to the AAI convention should be enthusiastically prepared to cheer wildly when Maher says something right and reasonable and even funny about religion, and if he brings up anti-vax woo or anti-research fluff, you should be equally prepared to pull out the rhetorical knives. I think &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; speaking at this convention should be aware that they are not there to receive unthinking hugs and kisses from an adoring audience of fans — they should come with ideas to make everyone &lt;b&gt;think&lt;/b&gt;, and they should know that they will get arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's our answer to the other, most unfortunate idiocies which Maher espouses. Let's make him uncomfortable. Don't be shy about asking pointed questions and making him squirm. It'll be fun. It'll also be safe, because a majority of the audience will be feeling the same way about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also true for all of the other speakers&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. They're supposed to make you think, and you're supposed to make them think. Keep 'em all honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Well, except for me. You can just show up for my talk on militant atheism (title so far: "Don't Tread on Me") and blow me kisses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/put_maher_in_the_hot_seat.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eHR08n_XAsE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248368255382"><id gr:original-id="http://madscientistjunior.blogspot.com/2009/07/optimizing-algorithms-for-brain-machine.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/095cbf90b8145647</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Optimizing Algorithms for Brain-Machine Interfaces</title><published>2009-07-23T11:29:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T11:29:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/srMgUpMZOZM/optimizing-algorithms-for-brain-machine.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://madscientistjunior.blogspot.com/2009/07/optimizing-algorithms-for-brain-machine.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Imagine waking up trapped in a prison of your own flesh, blinking awake in the dull glow of a softly bleached hospital room.  Your arms and legs are unresponsive to the will to move them, to the simple desire to reach up and scratch the itchiness of morphine from your eyes.  Nothing happens, nothing responds, nothing moves, nothing feels.  You are an immobile head trapped on an unresponsive body, and no matter how loudly you scream against the walls of your confinement from inside your head, nothing happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily many quadriplegics retain the ability of speech and independent respiration.  However, their quality of life, and that of the more unfortunate patients who remain fully lucid but cannot communicate with the outside world by anything more than eye-blinking Morse code, remains severely compromised due to poor rehabilitation prospects and dependency upon others.  Perhaps one day we'll be able to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/10/991022005127.htm"&gt;repair injured nerves&lt;/a&gt; and restore connectivity with the rest of the body, but for now we're beginning to work out how to directly interface the brain with mechanical actuators such that a paralyzed patient could control a machine that would augment their standard of living using nothing more than their mind.  And some technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvani"&gt;Nerves&lt;/a&gt; and computers and both conveniently electrical.  The problem is that they each operate on very different electrical schema.  With computers we know which transistor is storing which bit of information (or can find out) and have discrete units of conductors, resistors, capacitors and such.  But it is very difficult to isolate the behavior of a single neuron in situ, so instead we use mass behavior of relatively large numbers of neurons to try to approximate functional firing chains.  To translate the chaotic, non-discrete signal from neurons into discrete signals for machines, we need an algorithm.  And to develop that algorithm, we need electrode-implanted animal models (unrestrained monkeys in this case) and scientists who can do math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Li and Nicolesis et al have developed a novel modification of pre-existing brain-machine interface algorithms in "Unscented Kalman Filter for Brain-Machine Interfaces".  Previous brain-machine interface algorithms were either linear or particle filters.  Linear filters (such as the Wiener and Kalman filters) didn't do as well approximating the behavior of neurons as particle filters, but they were much faster and computationally cheap enough that they could be used in real time.  In general, particle filters (such as SSPPF) were very good at modeling the behavioral input of neurons, but they were so cumbersome that each iterative point required computing time that put it outside the range of real-time applications.  Li and Nicolesis et al have modified a Kalman filter such that it uses a nonlinear tuning method (a quadratic model instead) and adds historical regression to help predict future behavior patterns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Implementing the quadratic neural tuning model greatly improved the accuracy of predicted neuron firing behavior, which means that the algorithm was better at interpreting the noisy signals from the neurons.  At the same time, the historical regression made brain-activity-guided movement of the prosthetic hand* smoother and also helped to tune the monkeys' training on the algorithm by operating as a sort of continuous optimization that kicked out inefficient processes to improve overall performance.  This quadratic model also significantly improved the reconstruction of the monkeys' desired hand movements during real-time tests in comparison to standard Kalman and Wiener filters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In effect, this new algorithm construction allows for more accurate control of a prosthesis, with low tuning demands and progressive learning of efficient movement correlates.  Ideally, this will one day allow paralyzed patients to accurately control mouse cursors (better than existing technology, anyway) or robotic prostheses that will greatly improve their quality of life.  This technology may still be crude, but it is progressing rapidly and with great potential.  I, for one, welcome the prospect of an auxiliary robotic arm.  It would be great for my benchwork productivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;*In this case, a cursor on a computer screen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=PLoS+ONE&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006243&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Unscented+Kalman+Filter+for+Brain-Machine+Interfaces&amp;amp;rft.issn=1932-6203&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=4&amp;amp;rft.issue=7&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.plos.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006243&amp;amp;rft.au=Li%2C+Z.&amp;amp;rft.au=O%27Doherty%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hanson%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=Lebedev%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Henriquez%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Nicolelis%2C+M.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CComputer+Science%2CNeuroscience%2CBiotechnology%2C+Bioinformatics%2C+Computational+Biology%2C+Systems+Biology%2C+Algorithms%2C+Human-Computer+Interaction%2C+Software+Engineering%2C+Computational+Neuroscience%2C+Neural+Engineering"&gt;Li, Z., O&amp;#39;Doherty, J., Hanson, T., Lebedev, M., Henriquez, C., &amp;amp; Nicolelis, M.

It’s been a while since I’ve posted a drop-dead gorgeous galaxy image. So if you’re Jonesing, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2009-14/ssc2009-14a.shtml"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/spitzer_ngc1097.jpg" alt="Spitzer view of the galaxy NGC 1097"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coooool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a &lt;a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/"&gt;Spitzer Space Telescope image&lt;/a&gt; of the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 1097. Located about 50 million light years away, this image is in the infrared, where light from warm dust is shown as red, and starlight shines as blue. The spiral arms are lousy with dust, created both when stars are born and when massive stars die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invisible in the exact middle of this galaxy is a supermassive black hole, and boy oh boy does that adjective fit: it’s about 100 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; times the mass of the Sun! We have one in the core of our own Milky Way galaxy, but ours is a paltry 4 million solar masses. So NGC 1097 has a bruiser in its heart. The intense point of light in the center is probably from gas and dust swirling around the black hole, matter on its way down an infinite drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This black hole is surrounded by a ring of star formation thousands of light years across, which you can see as that perfect circle of white light in the middle. Material from the bar — the long lines of gas and dust stretching across the middle of the galaxy — is feeding that ring, and stars there are being born in prodigious numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also cool is the little elliptical galaxy poking through NGC 1097 on the left. Probably by coincidence it happens to appear to be between the arms of the closer galaxy, giving us a relatively clear view of it. Or is it coincidence? The arms of 1097 are distorted and broken up there. Maybe they’re related… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stand back a bit and look at this image, the overall picture I get looks like an eye in space, staring back at me. The eye is such a simple shape that it’s no surprise to see its doppelganger, even one millions of light years away. Still, I wonder… NGC 1097 is an entire galaxy, fully equipped with hundreds of billions of stars. Do any of those stars have planets, and do those planets have life, and does that life have eyes (or their equivalent), and do those eyes look back at us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you stare into the abyss, you have to wonder if maybe the abyss really is staring back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248366499841"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/the-legend-of-grandmother-cells-continues/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/14403fd1bc455ec1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Brains"/><category term="Writing Elsewhere"/><title type="html">The Legend of Grandmother Cells Continues</title><published>2009-07-23T16:01:34Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T16:01:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/the-legend-of-grandmother-cells-continues/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my June brain column for &lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt;, I wrote about the bizarre idea that &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jun/15-can-single-neuron-tell-halle-berry-from-grandma-esther"&gt;there are single neurons in your head that can respond to individual people&lt;/a&gt;. The so-called “grandmother cell” started out 40 years ago as a thought experiment riffing on Philip Roth’s novel &lt;em&gt;Portnoy’s Complaint&lt;/em&gt;. By the 1970s, most neuroscientists considered it more of a joke than a valid concept, but in the years since it hasn’t quite gone away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my column, I described the work of the work of &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/single-brain-cell"&gt;Rodrigo Quian Quiroga&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Leicester:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the past eight years, he and his colleagues &lt;a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/engineering/research/bioengineering/neuroengineering-lab/research"&gt;have been studying&lt;/a&gt; epilepsy patients who have had electrodes implanted in a region of their brains called the medial temporal lobe, as part of a study to identify the source of their seizures. Quian Quiroga showed the subjects 100 pictures. The pictures included photos and drawings of celebrities as well as landmarks and various familiar objects. The patients had to press one button if a picture was of a human face and another if it was not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In their first such study, Quian Quiroga and his team were able to observe the individual activity of 993 neurons. They found that 132 of them responded to at least one picture. And of those responding neurons, 51 fired in response to only a single person or thing. One neuron responded only to Halle Berry, for example.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazingly, the “Halle Berry” neuron responded to any picture of her, including one in which she was dressed as the masked Catwoman. Even the name Halle Berry triggered that neuron, which was silent at the sight of other actresses or their names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quian Quiroga does not, however, believe these neurons are grandmother cells, at least as they were initially conceived. He suspect that a very sparse network of neurons–perhaps hundreds out of the billions in our heads–can develop this kind of response to an individual. Quian Quiroga just happen to stick his electrodes near single neurons that belonged to these networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Quian Quiroga’s latest paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. He analyzed the signals from 750 electrodes implanted in seven patients as they looked at pictures of some celebrities like Oprah Winfrey. Quian Quiroga found neurons that responded strongly to the sight of these individuals–and they also responded strongly to their written names and even the sounds of their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiroga and his colleagues also ran the same test using themselves rather than the celebrities to probe for neurons. They discovered neurons that responded strongly only to individual researchers, too–and once more, the same neurons responded to the sight and sound of their name. Bear in mind–the patients had only met the scientists a day or two earlier. So these neurons had developed their grandmother-ish response in a very short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results offer some clues to how these sparse networks are arranged. Some of the neurons probably get signals from other regions of the brain that recognize faces. Others tap into auditory networks, and others language centers. Yet, remarkably, the information from these far-flung parts of the brain get funneled into tiny sets of neurons that can then encode concepts of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may not be the Grandmother Cells of legend, but in their own way, they’re very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

It got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not very tall. When I was a little girl, I was very small and very shy. When the time came for me to board the bus for my first day of school, my father stopped me and said, “No matter how big the other kids are, don’t let any of them push you around or tell you what to do. Think for yourself.” It was probably some of the best advice anyone has ever given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, on that particular day I took the advice too much to heart and did not listen to which bus I was supposed to board for the ride home. I ended up on the other side of town, nearly giving my poor mother a heart attack when the school bus stopped after that critical first day and I did not get off. Fortunately, the driver of the bus I did get on was kind enough to go out of his way, and after he dropped the other children off, he drove far off his route to take me home as well. In the end everything worked out okay and I learned some valuable lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons I learned on that day encompassed more that just that wonderful first message of skepticism from my dear old Dad. One lesson I learned was that it is important to learn to filter information. Definitely do not allow yourself to be manipulated but be careful as not to be so closed off that you miss the important messages as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned (thanks to the bus driver) that for the most part, people are kind and most importantly, we are all on this ride together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics have a wonderful community filled with intelligent people from a variety of backgrounds with fantastic and unique outlooks on the world. At the same time, I realize that the skeptical community as a whole can often seem closed off and even inapproachable to people without scientific backgrounds. Skeptics are confused with cynics and elitists and are called closed minded, which is so very far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to clear up some misconceptions and to swing open the door to people who perhaps have never heard of the skeptical movement or feel alienated and to encourage them to get on board regardless of educational background or career. It is important that we send the message that skepticism is not a club for the high-brow mentality; it is a way of understanding the world that is helpful for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to get more people on the skepti-bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks and months that follow, I will be working on some fun, creative projects that are geared towards opening people’s minds to the wonderful world of skepticism and to sharing our message with a broader audience and I would truly appreciate your feedback. I would particularly love it if you shared your stories below as to how you first became a skeptic and what it is that you love about skepticism so that I might incorporate those mind opening experiences into future projects. I’d love to hear what gets you excited and why you are a skeptic so that I can work towards transferring that feeling to the people who simply do not understand us… yet.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s toys and equipment for kids with special needs, and its design is colorful, fun and inviting. Of course we all know that children with special needs enjoy the same toys as typically developing children, but a site like &lt;strong&gt;AblePlay&lt;/strong&gt; can help you choose toys that target a particular behavior or symptom. A search function lets you screen by disability category, specific disability, age range, manufacturer and type of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toys are fun and interesting, and you can register (it’s free) to add your own product reviews and post a wish list. Don’t be put off by the articles list that says “download attachment” when you click on a title. It does not download to your computer; it simply takes you to a pdf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 style="text-align:center"&gt;*       *       *&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to say yesterday, about that picture of Alex, that it also makes me wonder what Alex would be like if a few cells shifted a few millimeters away, or if his symptoms stem from being born premature or his hospitalization or a medication he was given, what if he’d been born a few weeks later, or given a lower dose of something. Would he be different? Could we have a conversation? Looking at the boy in this picture is like looking at a child I don’t know, but would like to. What would we talk about? What would he tell me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rg-d.com/nature/remote.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt; of Australia is remote and isolated, Shirley?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled in my Australian tax return yesterday. Those of you who have never had to fill in a tax return don’t know what you’re missing. For the rest of you, I find that at least half a bottle of wine dulls the pain somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rg-d.com/nature/invalid.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My relatives are perfectly valid, thankyouverymuch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps to have a sense of humour. The Australian Tax Office ‘eTax’ software makes the task a little less painful because if you’ve used it in a previous year you can ‘pre-fill’ a lot of information and you get any refund quite a bit faster than if you submit a paper return. The downside is that it only runs in Windows, which (&lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt; Richard Wintle) is quite a large downside, and results in a great deal of swearing at Black Towers as all the anti-virus software whinges about not being updated and what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rg-d.com/nature/film.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;photographs, he asked knowingly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we look around for little things to make us laugh. I am, however, a little disappointed that I can’t claim for going to the pictures. But I did shoot some videos of wildlife: does that count do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. Glad it’s out of the way. And because I left Australia before the end of the tax year there should be a reasonable refund coming my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay. Makes it all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing strange about that you might say, except for the fact that she insists publicly that she is absolutely not anti-vaccination but rather “pro-choice”. She even stated as much in a recent article about the dangers of not vaccinating, published on July 18 in the Brisbane QWeekend magazine;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are labelled as the antivaccination group but that’s simply not true,’’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really Meryl? Then please explain why you have joined a group which describes itself as follows;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“First and foremost, THIS IS NOT A DEBATE if you are pro vax don’t even bother. This group exists to help educate the Australian public about the dangers of vaccination if you are here to learn and contribute stay, if you want to argue, leave.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, now that doesn’t sound very  pro-choice to me! Could it be that Meryl has not been completely transparent about her views on vaccination?&lt;/p&gt;

It mentions nothing of the fact that the people associated with this "New Atheism" clearly state that there is nothing "new" about it, and the only sources it cites are Andrew Brown, who has become something of a mewling whiner about it, and Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary! It even talks about "Doctrines", as if we have any!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does list books by Dawkins, Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens…but doesn&amp;#39;t bother to say word one about what&amp;#39;s actually in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an article that actually belongs on Conservapædia—it is that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool thing is, so many people have written about it I can point to them. And while I could go on and on about how fantastic TAM is because of the people who attend it, as skeptics you should question my bias. That’s only fair.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that there are those of a religious bent who have said that skeptics, particularly atheistic ones, do not have a moral code to live by. And yet I spent four days in the company of skeptics who have proven that they live by the most basic moral code of all, the one most others are based on and without which would be useless: do good things on a daily basis, be kind to other people, and enjoy the time you have to spend with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June of last year I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/06/early_neolithic_golf_course.php"&gt;reported on my visit&lt;/a&gt; to a small research excavation directed by my &lt;em&gt;Fornvännen&lt;/em&gt; boss Lars Larsson at Botkyrka golf club south of Stockholm. The Stensborg site is highly unusual by the standards of this part of the country: a place near the sea shore where some of the region's first farmers congregated almost 6000 years ago and did some really weird shit. Sven Gunnar Broström, PhD h.c., one of Sweden's most active and respected self-taught archaeologists, discovered it in the late 60s. Simply through fieldwalking he and Kent Ihrestam recovered and recorded 3000 finds, largely axes and axe-making debris, much of it exotic rock types, and much of it burnt. He also found some very nice Funnel Beaker, &lt;i&gt;Trichterbecher&lt;/i&gt;, TRB pottery. Now he's digging the site with Lars and Elin Fornander, one of the good archaeo-lab folks who took the time to hear &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/05/alan_sokal_on_the_nature_and_u.php"&gt;Alan Sokal's talk&lt;/a&gt; this last June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/axes_and_grain_for_neolithic_g/P1010245lores.JPG" width="263" height="350" alt="P1010245lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a big cultic bonfire on some forgotten equinox in the 37th century BC. Imagine tossing into it a big expensive polished flint axe you've traded for from the distant flint-producing areas in the south. See it turning into fireworks and flying into bits with a loud crackling noise. This was done with some regularity at Stensborg in the Early Neolithic. Ostentatious public consumption of exotic commodities on the northern edge of Neolithic Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/axes_and_grain_for_neolithic_g/P1010252lores.JPG" width="500" height="175" alt="P1010252lores.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year Lars's team dug test pits and small trenches in the ploughsoil, finding more of the kind of stuff Sven Gunnar had collected. This year they've machine-stripped a few hundred square meters to check out what survives beneath plough depth. And they've been richly rewarded, not just with more of the same find categories and by burnt human bones, but with the most essentially Neolithic kind of find possible: litre after litre after litre of carbonised grain. It lies around the whole site, and pools in little pits with lithics and pottery and bones. This grain is perfect for radiocarbon, for palaeobotany, for inferring early agricultural methods through the species and proportion of weed seeds in it, and I'd be most surprised if there won't prove to be enough DNA left in it to allow plant geneticists to identify where the seed grain came from. Lovely stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I had the pleasure to help fold up and truss the site tent for its horse-transport ride back to Scania. It's one of the inflatable rubber military field hospitals Lars bought for the classic Skateholm dig in 1982. "Well whaddya know", said Lars appreciatively, "you're actually good for something besides blogging!".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/axes_and_grain_for_the_neolith.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/6m3EFn2Cu_g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248359280040"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/george-wills-crack-fact-checkers-continue-their-nap/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/80c9b1a0f8ee539c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meta"/><category term="The George Will On Ice Affair"/><title type="html">George Will’s Crack Fact-Checkers Continue Their Nap</title><published>2009-07-23T14:24:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T14:24:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/george-wills-crack-fact-checkers-continue-their-nap/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ndn2.newsweek.com/media/58/MUG_GeorgeWill-thumb7.jpg" align="left" height="150" width="150"&gt;There is no way to keep up with all the bad reporting on science these days, but I cannot resist certain egregious cases. As Loom readers know, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/category/the-george-will-on-ice-affair/"&gt;George Will writing about global warming&lt;/a&gt; is one. This morning brings fresh evidence of his trouble with the facts–and, more importantly–the empty claims of the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;’s editorial page that they respect the time-honored art of fact-checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, George Will wrote some columns starting in February in which he claimed that scientific evidence shows that all the heat-trapping carbon dioxide we’re putting in the atmosphere is having no effect on the planet. He claimed as proof that global ice levels had not changed in thirty years and that in fact there has been no global warming since 1998, just to name two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/giss440.jpg" alt="giss440.jpg" align="left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Loom and many other blogs pointed out why these claims were in error. Will ignores the fact that climate change is a noisy, long-term process. Today it is cooler at my house than it was yesterday. That does not mean that next week I will wake up to find snow on my doorstep. If you look at the annual mean temperature of the planet, you can cherry-pick one year, such as 1998, in order to make the false claim that there is no global warming. Of course, you could just as easily pick 1999, in which case the same logic would force you to conclude that there has been a staggering increase in temperature. But that’s not how climate scientists actually study global warming. They look at long term patterns, such as the red line in this graph from NASA, which represents the five-year mean since 1880. And when they do, they recognize a long-term trend of rising temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This somehow slipped through the multiple levels of fact-checking carried out by the editorial page staff at the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. Nor could they catch the other errors Will made on the science. So my fellow blogger Chris Mooney and the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization made it easy for them, by writing &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/03/21/glaciers-and-electrons/"&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/20/AR2009032003191.html?sub=AR"&gt;a letter &lt;/a&gt;respectively, to set things straight. The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; even saw fit to run both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did not, however, issue any correction on Will’s claims. Ombudsman Andrew Alexander, who claimed that there had been fact-checking on multiple levels, did acknowledge things might have been handled a wee bit better, and then &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/28/ice-ice-baby-when-fact-checking-is-not-fact-checking/"&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; this sunny thought for the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On its news pages, it can recommit to reporting on climate change that is authoritative and deep. &lt;em&gt;On the editorial pages, it can present a mix of respected and informed viewpoints.&lt;/em&gt; And online, it can encourage dialogue that is robust, even if it becomes bellicose.  &lt;/strong&gt;[Emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, Alexander’s wish is being ignored. Today Will has published &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/22/AR2009072202415.html"&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; about recent negotiations on controlling carbon emissions. He considers them a bunch of empty promises, which seems to be just fine with Will, because there is no global warming to control anyway. Here’s how Will closes his latest piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;When New York Times columnist Tom Friedman &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/opinion/01friedman.html"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; upon “young Americans” to “get a million people on the Washington Mall calling for a price on carbon,” another columnist, Mark Steyn, &lt;a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzJjZTQ4ZWRhZjkxZWE5NDFlYTY3NjUwYmU4ZDA5MGY="&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;: “If you’re 29, there has been no global warming for your entire adult life. If you’re graduating high school, there has been no global warming since you entered first grade.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which could explain why the Mall does not reverberate with youthful clamors about carbon. And why, regarding climate change, the U.S. government, rushing to impose unilateral cap-and-trade burdens on the sagging U.S. economy, looks increasingly like someone who bought a closetful of platform shoes and bell-bottom slacks just as disco was dying. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In earlier days, Will liked to claim the World Meteorological Organization as an authority when he wrote that there has been no global warming since 1998. Now that the World Meteorological Organization has set things straight, he’s claiming a columnist at National Review as his authority. That’s quite an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most urgent question today’s column raises is not about Will, but about how media organizations decide how to present science to the public. If the Post’s editorial page editors really do believe in fact-checking and in “respected and informed viewpoints,” I can only conclude that they slept in very late this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/23/george-wills-crack-fact-checkers-continue-their-nap/#comment-19856"&gt;A commenter&lt;/a&gt; below accuses me of intellectual dishonesty for not showing a graph with a longer time-scale, which, I guess, would show that there’s no link between between carbon and climate. Ummm…like this one? (CO2 levels as black curve, temperature grey. &lt;a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/Publications/Book_chapters/Rahmstorf_Zedillo_2008.pdf"&gt;Source pdf&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

While it's true I've taken him to task for having a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/dawkins_tin_ear_on_bioethics.php"&gt;tin ear for bioethics&lt;/a&gt;, lamented his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/10/dawkins_walked_right_into_that_one.php"&gt;walking blindly right into charges of anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; (no, I don't think he's an anti-Semite), and half-defended/half-criticized him for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/11/richard_dawkins_a_eugenicist.php"&gt;seeming to endorsing eugenics&lt;/a&gt;. What's really irritated me about him in the past, though, is his use of the "Neville Chamber atheist" gambit that I so detest, so much so that I once featured Dawkins in a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/hitler_zombie_massacre_over_evolution_pa.php"&gt;Hitler Zombie episode&lt;/a&gt; (albeit not as the victim). On the other hand, I loved Dawkins' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enemies_of_Reason"&gt;The Enemies of Reason&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/the_enemies_of_reason_part_2.php"&gt;Dawkins' demolitio&lt;/a&gt;n of Deepak Chopra and other woo-meisters. Indeed, his explanation of the ridiculousness of the pseudoscience that is homeopathy was about as clear and visually compelling as any I've ever seen, and I loved how he and P.Z. Myers totally &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/the_dawkins_incident_sometimes_its_neces.php"&gt;pwned the producers of &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com"&gt;Expelled!&lt;/a&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through it all, even though I don't always agree with Richard Dawkins mostly on matters of religion versus atheism and how to advocate for reason, I have never doubted that he is a force for reason to be reckoned with. I've even briefly met him, although I highly doubt that he'd remember me, my being one of dozens of people who shook his hand that day &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/secularsociety"&gt;nearly two years ago in New York&lt;/a&gt;. There's even an award named after him, the Richard Dawkins Award, which the &lt;a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org"&gt;Atheist Alliance&lt;/a&gt; awards to one person every year &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist_Alliance_International#Richard_Dawkins_Award"&gt;based on these criteria:&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Richard Dawkins Award will be given every year to honor an outstanding atheist whose contributions raise public awareness of the nontheist life stance; who through writings, media, the arts, film, and/or the stage advocates increased scientific knowledge; who through work or by example teaches acceptance of the nontheist philosophy; and whose public posture mirrors the uncompromising nontheist life stance of Dr. Richard Dawkins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past recipients have included James Randi, Ann Druyan, Penn and Teller, Julia Sweeney, Daniel Dennett, and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, all worthy recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the other day I was rather shocked to see who the 2009 recipient of the Richard Dawkins Award will be. If you read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_problem_with_writing_by_co.php"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, you &lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org/schedule/speakers"&gt;knew the answer a couple of days ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.billmaher.com"&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There's a poll, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissimmee city commissioners are considering putting "In God We Trust" on a new city logo. Commissioner Art Otero says he proposed the change because he doesn't like the way the country is headed. Commissioner Carlos Irizarry questioned its legal advisability. The ACLU says it discriminates in favor of religions that believe in one God.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/osceola/orl-kissimmee-in-god-we-trust-poll-072309,0,5982262,post.poll"&gt;Should Kissimmee add "In God We Trust" to its official city logo?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. It's a patriotic move, just as the commissioner said. 
53.3%&lt;br&gt;
No. It discriminates in favor of monotheistic religions.
35.5%&lt;br&gt;
I don't know. What's wrong with leaving it the way it is?
11.2%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never can quite get the connection between patriotism and religion. Oh, wait, of course: it's because the loudest proponents of both tend to be equally mindless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they should have a new poll: "Should Kissimmee add 'There is one god and Mohammed is his prophet' to its official city logo?" If Art Otero can see that as a reasonable alternative, then I'd give him credit for being open-minded and really wanting to endorse faith as a solution to the nation's problems, rather than being just another sectarian wackjob.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/poll_to_insert_random_slogans.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ulVxj4vV2eY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248357314889"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_choice_is_clear.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/01c5c0de83c14cb5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">The choice is clear</title><published>2009-07-23T14:02:44Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T14:02:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/MVGHsaC6G7E/the_choice_is_clear.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_choice_is_clear.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're considering a pet, you have to weigh the pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fathom” secured the participation of three eminent historians of science, Sandra Herbert, Peter Bowler, and Janet Browne, who appear as talking heads in the movie. None of these people knew who was really backing that movie nor that it would have a creationist slant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the familiar story unfolds: these interviews were subsequently edited to paint a denigrating picture of Darwin and evolution.  Herbert, Bowler, and Browne report how they were taken in and bowdlerized in &lt;a href="http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2009/July_Perils_Publicity.html"&gt;a short piece&lt;/a&gt; in the History of Science Society’s newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interviews filmed with us have been edited to highlight certain aspects of Darwin’s views and character. Janet Browne’s remarks about his childhood delight in making up stories to impress people is used to imply that the same motive may have driven his scientific thinking. Peter Bowler’s description of Darwin’s later views on racial inequality is used in the film, but not Bowler’s account of Adrian Desmond and James Moore’s thesis that Darwin was inspired by his opposition to racism and slavery. Sandra Herbert’s comment that Darwin’s theory required explanation of many aspects of life was edited down to imply that his theory required explanation of all aspects of life. The overall impression is given that Darwin had an enquiring mind but was led astray by his theoretical preconceptions, a view backed up through interviews with several scientists, including one who expresses open doubts about evolution. The film also suggests that what is ultimately at stake is a clash of world views rather than the resolution of scientific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers admit that they were duplicitous, but claim that this lying was for the greater good. As William Crawley, &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2009/06/creationists_defend_darwin_fil.html"&gt;a blogger for the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Bell, CEO of Creation Ministries UK, acknoweged [sic] that his organisation established a “front company” called Fathom Media, because they were concerned that experts such as Peter Bowler would not agree to take part in the film if they realised it was an “overtly Creationist” production. “At the end of the day,” he said, “[when] people see ‘Creationist’, instantly the shutters go up and that would have shut us off from talking to the sort of experts, such as Professor Bowler, that we wanted to get to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Phil Bell if this method of securing an interview was “deceptive”. He said: “Well, it could be called deceptive. But I think, at the end of the day, I would say that more people are concerned about how we’ve made a documentary, that’s a world-class documentary, clearly with wonderful footage, with excellent interviews, and balanced open discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creation Ministries website also posted &lt;a href="http://creation.com/the-voyage-darwin-film-defended"&gt;a defense of their actions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, we wanted the film to be judged on its content,     not its associations. We did not want people to be “scared off” by our     advertising a link to CMI, but at the same time we were determined &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to bear false witness. If people had asked us, we determined from the outset that     the team would answer honestly, and we instructed the film crew that went to get     the interviews along those lines. Of course, we hoped and prayed (literally, and     earnestly) that such questions simply would not be asked—e.g. whether creationists     were driving it. We wanted straight answers to     the questions on these important matters from all, whether creationist or evolutionist—unhampered     by prejudice and all the other ‘baggage’ that has accumulated, much     of it quite unfairly, around the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course they manage to justify this duplicity by cherry-picking the Bible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were and are under an obligation to speak the truth, but not to provide     exhaustive information where it was not sought. The Bible     says of Jesus that “&lt;span&gt;no deceit was in his mouth&lt;/span&gt;”     (1 Peter 2:22), yet he withheld information from those who     were not ready to receive it, including the Pharisees (Matt. 21:23–27) and even his own disciples (John 16:12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson to all evolutionists.  I, for one, will be sure to ask who’s funding the project before I agree to any more interviews.  And I’m racking my brain furiously to remember which foreign companies interviewed me about Darwin in the last year.  There was one from South Korea, and another from Australia . . . .&lt;/p&gt;

So those of you who are here for the cartoons may want to &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1598"&gt;move along&lt;/a&gt;, since I'm about to (mis-?) use this forum to announce a new journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="http://elanguage.net/journals/index.php/jel/"&gt;Journal of Experimental Linguistics&lt;/a&gt; is part of the Linguistic Society of America's &lt;a href="http://elanguage.net/home.php"&gt;eLanguage initiative&lt;/a&gt;. Like the rest of eLanguage, JEL is an Open Access online journal. Regular publication will begin towards the end of 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;JEL is a linguistic "journal of reproducible research", that is, a journal of reproducible computational experiments on topics related to speech and language. These experiments may involve the analysis of previously­ published corpus data, or of experiment­-specific data that is published for the occasion. Other relevant categories include computational simulations, implementations of diagnostic techniques or task scoring methods, methodological tutorials, and reviews of relevant new publications (including new data and software).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In all cases, JEL articles will be accompanied by executable recipes for re­creating all figures, tables, numbers and other results. These recipes will be in the form of source code that runs in some generally-­available computational environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Although JEL is centered in linguistics, we aim to publish research from the widest possible range of disciplines that engage speech and language experimentally, from electrical engineering and computer science to education, psychology, biology, and speech pathology. In this interdisciplinary context, "reproducible research" is especially useful in helping experimental and analytical techniques to cross over from one sub­field to another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Publication is in online digital form only, with articles appearing as they complete the review process. A rigorous but rapid process of peer review, designed to take no more than 4-6 weeks from submission to publication, will be supplemented by a vigorously­-promoted system for adding moderated remarks and replies after publication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The editorial board, in alphabetical order, is Alan Black, Steven Bird, Harald Baayen, Paul Boersma, Tim Bunnell, Khalid Choukri, Christopher Cieri, John Coleman, Eric Fosler­-Lussier, John Goldsmith, Jen Hay, Stephen Isard, Greg Kochanski, Lori Levin, Mark Liberman, Brian MacWhinney, Ani Nenkova, James Pennebaker, Stuart Shieber, Chilin Shih, David Talkin, Betty Tuller, and Jiahong Yuan. Mark Liberman is the editor in chief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My involvement with this idea started with a Language Log post: "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003999.html"&gt;Executable Articles&lt;/a&gt;", 1/3/2007. There was some &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004011.html"&gt;further discussion&lt;/a&gt;, on the blog and off, and &lt;a href="http://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/anglistik3/stein/"&gt;Dieter Stein&lt;/a&gt; asked me to organize a special session on "&lt;a href="http://www.berlin6.org/?page_id=73"&gt;Open Data and Reproducible Research&lt;/a&gt;" at the Berlin 6 Open Access conference. The JEL eLanguage proposal followed; the LSA executive committee approved it;  after some infrastructure work in the background, we're now ready to start accepting submissions; and JEL should be on the air by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248354991512"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1598">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66ed01a275f7fe7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Conversational incongruence</title><published>2009-07-23T12:59:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T12:59:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1598" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/611/"&gt;recent xkcd&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever secretly wondered if the medical profession is comprised of neurotic individuals who change their mind more frequently than you change your clothes? Well, I can understand why you’d feel that way because the public is constantly barraged with mixed health messages. But why is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is complex, and I’d like to take a closer look at a few of the reasons in a series of blog posts. First, the human body is so incredibly complicated that we are constantly learning new things about it – how medicines, foods, and the environment impact it from the chemical to cellular to organ system level. There will always be new information, some of which may contradict previous thinking, and some that furthers it or ads a new facet to what we have already learned. Because human behavior is also so intricate, it’s far more difficult to prove a clear cause and effect relationship with certain treatments and interventions, due to the power of the human mind to perceive benefit when there is none (placebo effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the media, by its very nature, seeks to present data with less ambiguity than is warranted. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Science-Complementary-Alternative/dp/0195313682/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1198115766&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;R. Barker Bausell, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; explains this tendency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Superficiality is easier to present than depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The media cannot deal with ambiguity, subtlety, and diversity (which always characterizes scientific endeavors involving new areas of investigation or human behavior in general)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The bizarre always gets more attention than the usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is under intense pressure to find interesting sound bites to keep peoples’ attention. It’s not their job to present a careful and detailed analysis of the health news that they report. So it’s no wonder that a research paper suggesting that a certain herb may influence cancer cell protein expression in a Petri dish becomes: herb is new cure for cancer! Of course, many media outlets are more responsible in their reporting than that, but you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, the scientific method (if not carefully followed in rigorous, randomized, placebo-controlled trials) is a set up for false positive tests. What does that mean? It means that the default for your average research study (before it even begins) is that there will be a positive association between intervention and outcome. So I could do a trial on, say, the potential therapeutic use of candy bars for the treatment of eczema, and it’s likely (if I’m not a careful scientist) that the outcome will show a positive correlation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for false positive results (e.g. wrongly ascribing effectiveness to a given therapy) in scientific research. “Experimental artifacts” as they’re called, are very common and must be accounted for in a study’s design. For fun let’s think about how the following factors stack the deck in favor of positive research findings (regardless of the treatment being analyzed):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Natural History&lt;/strong&gt;: most medical conditions have fluctuating symptoms and many improve on their own over time. Therefore, for many conditions, one would expect improvement during the course of study, regardless of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Regression to the Mean: &lt;/strong&gt;people are more likely to join a research study when their illness/problem is at its worst during its natural history. Therefore, it is more likely that the symptoms will improve during the study than if they joined at times when symptoms were not as troublesome. Therefore, in any given study – there is a tendency for participants in particular to improve after joining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  &lt;strong&gt;The Hawthorne Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: people behave differently and experience treatment differently when they’re being studied. So for example, if people know they’re being observed regarding their work productivity, they’re likely to work harder during the research study. The enhanced results therefore, do not reflect typical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Limitations of Memory&lt;/strong&gt;: studies have shown that people ascribe greater improvement of symptoms in retrospect. Research that relies on patient recall is in danger of increased false positive rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Experimenter Bias&lt;/strong&gt;: it is difficult for researchers to treat all study subjects in an identical manner if they know which patient is receiving an experimental treatment versus a placebo. Their gestures and the way that they question the subjects may set up expectations of benefit. Also, scientists are eager to demonstrate positive results for publication purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Experimental Attrition&lt;/strong&gt;: people generally join research studies because they expect that they may benefit from the treatment they receive. If they suspect that they are in the placebo group, they are more likely to drop out of the study. This can influence the study results so that the sicker patients who are not finding benefit with the placebo drop out, leaving the milder cases to try to tease out their response to the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; I saved the most important artifact for last. The natural tendency for study subjects is to perceive that a treatment is effective. Previous research has shown that about 33% of study subjects will report that the placebo has a positive therapeutic effect of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my dear readers – if the media wants to get your attention with exaggerated representations of research findings, and the research findings themselves are stacked in favor of reporting an effect that isn’t real… then how on earth are we to know what to make of health news? Luckily, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Science-Complementary-Alternative/dp/0195313682/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1198115766&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;R. Barker Bausell&lt;/a&gt; has explained all of this really well in his book and I will attempt to summarize the following principles in the next few posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The importance of credible scientific evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The importance of plausible scientific evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The importance of reproducible scientific evidence&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a good &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/2009/07/21/hell-in-a-cell-an-evening-with-the-discovery-institute/"&gt;summary of one of his presentations in Seattle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, Meyer's argument is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

(1) According to Bill Gates, DNA is like a computer program.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Because I am unfamiliar with the field known as genetic programming, every computer program I've ever heard of has had a developer.&lt;br&gt;
(3) Charles Darwin once used the principle of Inference To The Best Explanation.&lt;br&gt;
(4) Even though Darwin was a wicked, wicked man, I'm going to use that same principle to refute him. It will be, you know, irony.&lt;br&gt;
(5) I say that intelligent design is the best explanation for the computer-program-like-ness of DNA.&lt;br&gt;
(6) Therefore, by Darwin's own reasoning, intelligent design must be true.&lt;br&gt;
(7) Please buy my book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read excerpts of this book. I&amp;#39;ve seen reviews and summaries of its argument. I&amp;#39;ve seen the freaking title. I know what is in this book — &amp;quot;ooooh, it&amp;#39;s so complex, it must have been…DESIGNED!!11!&amp;quot; — and I know that Stephen Meyer &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/22/stephen-meyer-lies-again/"&gt;lies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://recursed.blogspot.com/2009/07/stephen-meyers-honesty-problem.html"&gt;makes up pseudoscientific babble&lt;/a&gt;, so I have very poor expectations of this book: I anticipate bad biology and even worse information theory, and a mangled pretense of science by a contemptible poseur. I do have a review copy on the way, though, and I will read it from beginning to end, taking notes and snorting in derisive laughter all the way, and I will take &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/kingdomofpriests/2009/07/a-challenge-to-intelligent-design-bashing-regulars-on-this-blog.html"&gt;David Klinghoffer's ridiculous challenge to make a serious response&lt;/a&gt;. I won't win, though: my review will be too long for him, and unless there's some magic ju-ju that will completely reverse my opinion of ID creationism hidden in the text (which, strangely, none of the favorable reviews have bothered to highlight), it will most likely not be the kind of positive cheerleading for creationism that Klinghoffer favors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/more_discovery_institute_bulld.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tbilwOceo-k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248353704676"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/up_or_down.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42b9267dd31f8087</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Up or down?</title><published>2009-07-23T12:54:04Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T12:54:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/TVQvGqC36sU/up_or_down.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/up_or_down.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A professor of religion has decided that &lt;a href="http://www.thestate.com/140/story/869656.html"&gt;atheism is in decline and the "New Atheists" are over&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because sales of books by the "New Atheists" have declined since their release several years ago, Karen Armstrong has published her silly book, and surveys show that atheists are still a minority. And the reason they flopped is because atheists are such mean poopieheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, more bleary-eyed wishful thinking from a mind squicked by religion. Gosh, yes, older books sell at a much lower volume than fresh, new releases. And if you want to claim a trend, you can&amp;#39;t just cite data from one time point — you need at least two. He also thinks atheism needs to be &amp;quot;kinder, gentler and (most of all) wiser&amp;quot;. Sorry, guy. I gave all my &amp;quot;kinder, gentler&amp;quot; to my mom, and all I&amp;#39;ve got left is kick-ass for you…and it&amp;#39;s a funny definition of &amp;quot;wiser&amp;quot; that means &amp;quot;believe in angels&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, Mr Religion Professor ought to be reading the Christian Science Monitor, which reports that &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0716/p22s01-ussc.html"&gt;atheism is growing&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Mr RP, they at least know that you need to report prior numbers compared to current numbers if you want to talk about a trend. He tut-tuts over a mere 15% of the population reporting a lack of religion. The CSM says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 15 percent of Americans claim no religious affiliation, &lt;b&gt;up from 8.2 percent in 1990&lt;/b&gt;, according to Trinity College's American Religious Identification Survey, released in March. Also, the American Humanist Association claims 20,000 financial supporters. That marks a doubling from five years ago, says spokeswoman Karen Frantz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's got much more evidence, too. My subjective feeling from visiting many freethought groups over the years has been one of remarkable growth and booming enthusiasm; the article confirms that with reports of enrollment numbers and donation figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Religion Professor needs to stick to his day job. At least there, making stuff up and imaginary figures are considered normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/up_or_down.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/TVQvGqC36sU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248353291700"><id gr:original-id="http://blog.biodata.com/2009/7/23/science-news-july-19">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a82fce247c7f35d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Science News: Week of July 19, 2009</title><published>2009-07-23T07:28:56Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T07:28:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/vVajunRcyq0/science-news-july-19" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.biodata.com/2009/7/23/science-news-july-19"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Our weekly compilation of science news for the week of July 19, 2009....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, over the past few days at Yale and Northwestern, I’ve been fortunate to have another two great events courtesy of graduate student chapters of Scientists and Engineers for America–&lt;a href="http://www.yale.edu/sea/"&gt;Yale’s&lt;/a&gt; and Northwestern’s (the latter is called the &lt;a href="http://www.nuspan.org/"&gt;Science and Policy Action Network&lt;/a&gt;).Who knew that some 200 grad students (and others) on these two campuses would come out to hear about how they need to become our next generation of science emissaries to the public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet the energy and enthusiasm is clearly there–these scientists &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to become such emissaries. They don’t want to fight old culture wars, they want to change something. They want to give something back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re science’s Obama generation, and I’m thrilled to get to meet them across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248350734438"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_360.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/db9e6b87c7c20704</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-23T08:59:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T08:59:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/90v0ctT12v8/clock_quotes_360.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_360.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each wrong act brings with it its own anesthetic, dulling the conscience and blinding it against further light, and sometimes for years. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I've written a chapter in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1425183794?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=213381&amp;amp;creative=390973&amp;amp;linkCode=as4&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1425183794&amp;amp;adid=111DZYWRD26JY50W2QCB&amp;amp;"&gt;my companion book&lt;/a&gt; on that topic, but for people who don't have that book this is where I'll place links below about this problem.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll begin with an actual email that's typical of the ones I receive: &lt;blockquote&gt;Greetings.  I know you must get tons of email everyday, and thus cannot respond to each one.  I’m hoping just writing this will help.  I’ll keep my story short.  It is similar to yours in many ways, although I confess I did not go as deeply into the intellectual end of Christianity as you did, however I consider myself a fairly intelligent person.  Certainly, at least, a thoughtful one...  I was converted to Pentecostal Christianity in my teen years following a rocky childhood…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I pursued a calling in full time ministry for 9 years after going to Bible college for 4 years and being credentialed with the Assemblies of God.  I was later ordained as well. Recently, due to some relatively minor occurrences, a floodgate of doubts has opened up to me in my faith.  I had come across a couple of books that peaked my interest, such as Dawkins book “The God Delusion”.  I am currently working my way through it.  I’ve always contended what good is your faith if it can’t stand up to scrutiny?   Well, mine isn’t standing up very well.  It is not the outside sources warring on me (such as Dawkins book, or the anti-christian bias of our culture), as much as my own struggle with my beliefs and being honest to myself. I find I am tortured going to church now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll be honest.  I’m scared.  No, petrified.  I feel like I’ve murdered someone and am trying to keep it a secret.  My wife literally has no idea, and would / will come unglued when I finally bring the subject up.  I’m scared of the response of my wife/kids/family, but also of the prospect of life without God.  Yet I feel a strange sense of exhilaration as well, like a great burden may be soon lifted off my shoulders. This is what I experienced when I left the ministry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said, I can’t even believe I’m writing you this email.  I’ve read through much of your blog.  Yet there are a couple of questions that I didn’t see addressed (perhaps they are in your book) that I think would be great for the average “joe” like me, who is really struggling in their faith.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) What do I do now?  How do I weed through all of the questions / struggles / problems going on in my head?  Where do I start?  How do I tell my family?  How do I explain (there is no one simple answer)?  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;2) What would you say to the “guy on the street”? What I mean is this. I consider myself to be of average or slightly above average intelligence, with a higher motivation than most for understanding things (I enjoyed school). But what about the average guy that needs it boiled down in USA today fashion?  Is there hope for this person, or do we merely leave them to struggle along with their faith? I REALLY appreciate your approach (not angry, bitter, condescending), like many other people who are anti-Christian. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I purchased your book today (linked through your site so you should get some commission), and I do intend to support the site. I know this gets a bit tricky, probably not wanting to take the Church approach of asking for donations, but I’m glad you have the option there. I still believe a workman is worth his wage. You are performing a great service, and I hope you are able to support yourself at some point through the service you provide. I am finding many of the stories and posts simply fascinating, and I’ve only scratched the surface. As I said, I’m very early in this journey, and not at all sure where it is going to take me. Either way, I’m glad you’ve made this site available.  It is a Godsend (sorry, I just had to say that.  I’ve a bit of a warped sense of humor).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can’t imagine how difficult it must have been in terms of the personal attacks you’ve had to endure. I am going to continue down this road, and your book seems to be the most “human” approach to the subject I’ve seen so far.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes to you, and thanks again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here is my typical response: 1) I don't know you or your family to be able to give specific advice on what to do now. But I know I would tell your family and friends when the time was right. I would break it to them slowly by asking questions or by telling them you are investigating into the new atheists and show them the books you're reading. After all, if your faith is true then it should withstand the arguments to the contrary. And I would ask them the questions that these books are asking whenever I could. [Actually for anyone who is secretly reading this Blog and/or these books I would tell my Christian friends up front about this, just in the slim case that you might actually lose your faith. I would inform people from the very beginning so they would not be that shocked if you do deconvert.] &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;2) To the "guy on the street" I’d say that Christianity doesn't make sense. That opens up the discussion. If they say you're not supposed to make sense of it but just believe, I say that advice doesn't make sense. ;-) Then I would tell them that if God exists he created us with our minds and if that's so we should use them. If God is a reasonable God then the truth should comport to reason. In fact, we are asked to love God with all of our minds (the greatest commandment). So if it doesn't make sense then there is a real problem for faith. I cannot do othewise but to use my mind. Such a faith should stand up to reason so by saying it's "not supposed to make sense" makes no sense. I cannot think otherwise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some similar links: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com:80/2007/09/some-advice-to-those-who-leave.html"&gt;Some advice to those who leave Christianity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com:80/2007/09/should-i-come-out-of-closet.html"&gt;Should I come out of the closet?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com:80/2008/02/i-no-longer-believe-what-do-i-tell-my.html"&gt;I no longer believe: What do I tell my kids?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com:80/2008/02/another-person-walks-away-from.html"&gt;Ed Owens' story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/help-me-convince-my-brother-john.html"&gt;Help me Convince my Brother, John!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a link to a young man who feared the worse in telling his parent he no longer believed and &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/another-one-comes-out-to-his-family-and.html"&gt;found it to be just fine&lt;/a&gt;.

The results suggest that genes exert a significant influence on exceptional cognitive ability, similar in magnitude to their influence on the normal range of intelligence. The findings challenge versions of the "discontinuity hypothesis" – the idea that the relative contribution of nature and nurture changes for exceptional ability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/default.aspx?go=11089"&gt;Claire Haworth&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues, of the newly-established Genetics of High Cognitive Abilities (GHCA) consortium, combined data from six studies, involving twins from four countries – the UK, Netherlands, Australia and United States. Combining so much data altogether allowed them to restrict their analyses to participants in the top 15 per cent for intelligence performance, whilst still maintaining enough power for statistical tests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By comparing intelligence differences between pairs of identical twins (who share all their genes) and non-identical twins (who share half their genes like normal siblings), the study showed that genetic differences explained approximately half the variation found in high intelligence, whilst shared environmental factors - those experienced by both twins in a pair, such as education and parenting style - explained just 28 per cent of the variation. The remaining influence is down to unique environmental influences (experienced by one twin but not the other) and other unknown factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The observed level of genetic influence on exceptionally high intelligence is similar to that found by the researchers for the normal range of intelligence in the same sample of twin pairs, and supports the idea that exceptional cognitive ability is on a continuum with the normal range of intelligence, and is likely subject to the same genetic and environmental influences. However, final proof that the same genes affect high intelligence and the normal distribution won’t be found until specific genes are identified through DNA testing of gifted and control participants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be noted that the cited contributions of genes and the environment aren’t necessarily fixed. Rather these estimates reflect the amount of variation explained by genetic and environmental factors for this particular group of twin participants at one particular time. The generalisability of the findings are, however, enhanced by the large size and cross-national nature of the sample. Another caveat is that investigating the top 15 per cent of intelligence test performers may not be high enough to capture any influences that uniquely affect exceptional cognitive ability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We hope that our study, the many interesting and unanswered questions about high cognitive ability, and the importance of studying the high end of the distribution of ability as well as the low end, will stimulate much-needed research on the genetics of high cognitive ability," the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Behavior+Genetics&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1007%2Fs10519-009-9262-3&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=A+Twin+Study+of+the+Genetics+of+High+Cognitive+Ability+Selected+from+11%2C000+Twin+Pairs+in+Six+Studies+from+Four+Countries&amp;amp;rft.issn=0001-8244&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=39&amp;amp;rft.issue=4&amp;amp;rft.spage=359&amp;amp;rft.epage=370&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springerlink.com%2Findex%2F10.1007%2Fs10519-009-9262-3&amp;amp;rft.au=Haworth%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wright%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Martin%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Martin%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Boomsma%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Bartels%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Posthuma%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Davis%2C+O.&amp;amp;rft.au=Brant%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Corley%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hewitt%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Iacono%2C+W.&amp;amp;rft.au=McGue%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Thompson%2C+L.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hart%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Petrill%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Lubinski%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Plomin%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CBehavioural+genetics"&gt;Haworth, C., Wright, M., Martin, N., Martin, N., Boomsma, D., Bartels, M., Posthuma, D., Davis, O., Brant, A., Corley, R., Hewitt, J., Iacono, W., McGue, M., Thompson, L., Hart, S., Petrill, S., Lubinski, D., &amp;amp; Plomin, R.

This time they struck in my own back yard, at the University of California, Irvine. In fact, in my dad’s neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I’ve chosen not to promote the name of this particular group. Why? Because they can kiss my [censored]. This is an extract from the Orange County Register, by their excellent science editor &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/garyrobbins"&gt;Gary Robbins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal rights group known as the [not promoted here] has claimed responsibility for vandalism that was done to the property of a UC Irvine scientist on July 10, campus officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Not promoted here] states  in an email to this blog that, “On  July 10, 2009 3 vehicles and the home of a UC Irvine vivisector were hit by the [not promoted here]. 1 of his cars (the fanciest of the 4 in front) was doused with paint stripper. 2 others had red paint poured all over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More red paint was splattered across his driveway, and “KILLER” was spray painted in huge red letters across his garage door so that all his neighbors could see what a cruel, sick person they live near.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sgt. Shaun Devlin of the UCI Police Department confirmed that an act of vandalism occurred and that the department is investigating. Susan Bryant, vice chancellor of research, also confirmed that there was an incident. She added that, “We’re mystified why this person was targeted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professor whose property was attacked has not been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Goodwin, director of UCI’s University Laboratory Animal Resources, said in an email sent to campus researchers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The …  incident has been reported to UCIPD and is under investigation. The Professor involved has taken a leave of absence from UCI beginning 7-1-09 to work at another university although he still lives in University Hills at UCI. This professor conducts research on rats and mice at UCI but may currently be collaborating on non-human primate studies at another institution. The professor has stated he had not been the subject of any threats or action in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“UCIPD has notified the institution where the involved Professor currently works, as well as the FBI, and the Orange County Intelligence Assessment Team. UCIPD detectives are conducting an additional follow-up investigation and have placed heavy patrol checks on the professor’s residence in University Hills. We are working with our University Communications to prepare for any media inquiries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, domestic terrorism? It’s not like they blew up a building or killed anyone. But they are actually classified as a terrorist organization by the United States Department of Homeland Security. My guess is that this particular childish vandalism was carried out by a couple of students who watched a documentary on baby harp seals and wanted to show they’re more enlightened than the rest of us as a result of that viewing. Well, keep at it, boys, and while you’re at it, show how manly you are by smoking some cloves and downing a 40 in the supermarket parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

You may have already read two posts on yesterday's &lt;a href="http://nytimes.com"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/"&gt;Motherlode&lt;/a&gt; parenting blog, the first entitled &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/the-unvarnished-reality-of-autism/"&gt;The Unvarnished Reality of Autism&lt;/a&gt; by the unnamed mother of a 5-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome and the second entitled &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/autism-from-the-inside-looking-out/"&gt;Autism from the Inside Looking Out&lt;/a&gt; by a self-advocate, &lt;a href="http://autisticcats.blogspot.com/"&gt;Sarah&lt;/a&gt;. The effect of these two concurrent posts is to highlight the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/division_again_but_of_a_different_sort"&gt;divisions&lt;/a&gt; between parents and adults on the spectrum, between parent advocates and self-advocates, without conveying any sense of how we might meet; of how some, though not all, of our concerns intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post by the mother begins with the phrase "it's time to stop mincing words" and refers to life raising a child on the autism spectrum as difficult beyond compare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;....don’t throw your euphemisms my way. Recognize that life with my son’s Asperger’s — life anywhere on the autism spectrum — can be at least a periodic nightmare, and respect my struggle enough to allow me to call it that. Know that not everything is bad — I am blessed with many moments of joy with our often adorable and cuddly boy. We share jokes and laugh together; we play and sing and dance; he holds my hand as I sing him to sleep each night, kisses me back and tells me, “I love you, Mommy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the times that keep my going, but also break my heart — to see what he can be, and to think his volatile autism could hold him back, could ruin everything. Because to pretend otherwise, to sugarcoat with euphemism, does not make it go away. And it doesn’t help me to help him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a response, Sarah writes that she "wasn’t an easy child to raise, and that [her] parents did find some things to be rather difficult" and offers a sense of how it felt to be that child. And, as she notes in addressing the other blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your blog entry represented autistic people as monsters who cause life to be a “nightmare” for those around us. We are blamed for our parents’ depression, marriage problems, and feelings of humiliation and social isolation. Perhaps that is not the intent, but that is how I interpret this mother’s words. Were I to read a similar blog entry from my own mother, I would be extremely hurt. I only hope this young boy doesn’t realize that his mother blames him for all of these things.&lt;br&gt;
........&lt;br&gt;
We might not be the child which you expected, but we ought not be represented as monsters, or physically and emotionally hurt by those who love us, or blamed for all of our parents’ woes. Being made to feel like a freak who couldn’t handle situations the “normal” way never helped me. It just made me feel worse about myself, and less able to cope with the rather overwhelming world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, consider that autistic people read blogs and have feelings as well. Your blog entry claims to show “the unvarnished reality of autism,” but the feelings and perceptions of actual autistic people are sadly missing from your account. We need to stop casting blame and citing “autism” (autistic people) as the cause for parents’ nightmares, and start working on constructive ways in which autistic people can feel more comfortable in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left a &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/the-unvarnished-reality-of-autism/?apage=3#comment-83289"&gt;short comment&lt;/a&gt; which I'll rephrase slightly here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that not all parents of autistic children share the same perspective about autism, and the impact of autism on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While things are not easy—and my twelve year old son, Charlie, is on the moderate to severe end of the autism spectrum—for my husband, Jim Fisher, and me, life raising our son has been a journey that we would not have wanted to have missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will agree, but I do think it's possible to find some common ground as articulated in the call for an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_autism_corps"&gt;Autism Corps&lt;/a&gt;. My 12-year-old just keeps getting older and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/size_matters"&gt;bigger&lt;/a&gt; and he'll be an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_isnt_only_for_children"&gt;adult on the autism spectrum&lt;/a&gt; before too long. There are many differences between the experience of my son and that of, for instance, an adult with Asperger's but there are many commonalities. There is a shared need for more understanding and compassion from society, that's for sure, and there is also a need for supports and options in, for instance, education, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/jobs_college_transitions"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/homelessness_disability"&gt;housing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often, in the rush to explain "what it's really like"---our own private "unvarnished reality"---we accentuate the differences and the divisions. We forget how helpful it might be to imagine ourselves in each other's shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I for one wish to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248331203527"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc6169272019df45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">In Defense of Karma</title><published>2009-07-23T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/646-in-defense-of-karma.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Karma, the belief that the actions in your life are somehow tallied and weighed for or against you, falls firmly in the realm of woo-woo.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC Irvine scientists have shown for the first time that neural stem cells can rescue memory in mice with advanced Alzheimer’s disease, raising hopes of a potential treatment for the leading cause of elderly dementia that afflicts 5.3 million people in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now unfortunately, this doesn’t necessarily mean it will show the same or even similar results in humans. But it definitely seems to give some validation to the kind of amazing medical breakthroughs scientists hoped would come out of the stem cell program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though if cartoons have taught us anything, it might not be a good idea to make the lab mice too smart.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, so many institutions (or rather, their bureaucrats - scientists would abandon it if their bosses would) cling to IF anyway. Probably because nobody has pushed for a good alternative yet. In the world of science publishing, when something needs to be done, usually people look at us (that is: PLoS) to make the first move. The beauty of being a path-blazer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in today's post 'PLoS Journals - measuring impact where it matters' on the &lt;a href="https://www.plos.org/cms/node/478/" title=""&gt;PLoS Blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/07/22/plos-journals-%E2%80%93-measuring-impact-where-it-matters/" title=""&gt;everyONE blog&lt;/a&gt;, PLoS Director of Publishing Mark Patterson explains how we are moving away from the IF world (basically by ignoring it despite our journals' potential for marketing via their high IFs, until the others catch up with us and start ignoring it as well) and focusing our energies in providing as many as possible article-level metrics instead. Mark wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article-level metrics and indicators will become powerful additions to the tools for the assessment and filtering of research outputs, and we look forward to working with the research community, publishers, funders and institutions to develop and hone these ideas. As for the impact factor, the 2008 numbers were released last month. But rather than updating the PLoS Journal sites with the new numbers, we've decided to stop promoting journal impact factors on our sites all together. It's time to move on, and focus efforts on more sophisticated, flexible and meaningful measures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/06/25/plos-one-and-article-level-metrics/" title=""&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/27/article-level-metrics-at-plos/" title=""&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/07/13/experiences-of-highly-cited-authors-supports-the-plos-one-editorial-vision/" title=""&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, Peter Binfield, managing editor of PLoS ONE, &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/03/31/newly-launched-features-on-our-online-platform/" title=""&gt;explained the details of article-level metrics&lt;/a&gt; that are now employed and displayed on all seven PLoS journals. These are going to be &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/05/12/mendeley-bookmarklet-added-to-plos-articles/" title=""&gt;added to&lt;/a&gt; and upgraded regularly, whenever we and the community feel there is a need to include another metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we will not do is try to reduce these metrics to a single number ourselves. We want to make all the raw data available to the public to use as they see fit and we will all watch as the new standards emerge. We feel that different kinds of metrics are important to different people in different situations, and that these criteria will also change over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paper of yours may be important for you to be seen by your peers (perhaps for career-related reasons which are nothing to frown about) in which case the citation numbers and download statistics may be much more important than the bookmarking statistics or the media/blog coverage or the on-article user activity (e.g., ratings, notes and comments). At least for now - this may change in the future. But another paper you may think would be particularly important to be seen by physicians around the world (or science teachers, or political journalists, etc.), in which case media/blog coverage numbers are much more important for you than citations - you are measuring your success by how broad an audience you could reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will differ from paper to paper, from person to person, from scientific field to field, from institution to institution, and from country to country. I am sure there will be people out there who will try to put those numbers into various formulae and crunch the numbers and come up with some kind of "summary value" or "article-level impact value" which may or may not become a new standard in some places - time will tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But making all the numbers available is what is the most important for the scientific community as a whole. And this is what we will provide. And then the others will have to start providing them as well because authors will demand to see them. Perhaps this is a historic day in the world of science publishing....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/measuring_scientific_impact_wh.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/o5d6gRMyhvA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248327712379"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/jukys_edition_of_skeptical_par.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9731efe697a6c41c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">July's Edition of Skeptical Parents Crossing!!!</title><published>2009-07-23T05:00:52Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T05:00:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/Iy8MM2jH7xM/jukys_edition_of_skeptical_par.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/jukys_edition_of_skeptical_par.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month Blake, writer of the &lt;a href="http://www.skepdad.com/"&gt;SkepDad blog&lt;/a&gt; and founder of the &lt;a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/cprof_5150.html"&gt;Skeptical Parents Crossing Carnival,&lt;/a&gt; has asked everyone's favorite domestic and laboratory diva to play host. Here's a brief description of the carnival for my science readers who might be less familiar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Skeptical Parent Crossing is a blog carnival for free-thinking, rational parents. This carnival is less about giving advice than it is about evaluating such advice. Less about making claims, more about evaluating them. As with skepticism in general, it is about learning how to think, not being told what to think. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am delighted and this month's entries are full of hot parenting deliciousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliciousness, except that I have all of the entries open separate windows and one of you has a blog with embedded background music. When I find you, you are dead to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, one of the most challenging jobs Dr. Isis has is as mother and one of the things I like about this carnival is that it reminds me that this job is challenging no matter how you spend your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we have taken on potty training in the Isis household. I have decided to show you all how it is going in convenient graphic form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cheezburger.com/view.aspx?ciid=4771870"&gt;&lt;img alt="funny pictures" src="http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2009/7/22/128927903320411580.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's all hope that this month's carnival contributors are having better luck than Dr. Isis.&lt;/p&gt;

Help!  Help!  My sister has been murdered!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A white, female police officer approaches.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ch Supt Joanna Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What seems to be be the problem, guv’nor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jagdeesh Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s one of those so-called “honour killings”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ch Supt Joanna Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Is that even a crime in this country, guv’nor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jagdeesh Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where’s a Sikh officer?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Palbinder Singh, no relation, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Sikh Association, comes running.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palbinder Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please, sir, what is the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jagdeesh Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My sister has been “honour killed”!  And this white officer is doing nothing to help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palbinder Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don’t believe a white officer is ever going to be fully conversant with a Sikh.  Especially in a case like this, where Punjabi culture is itself the issue.  It’s good that you called for the SVU, sir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Another Sikh, Sharan Kaur, overhears the conversation and walks up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharan Kaur&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wait a minute.  It doesn’t matter what religion, what creed, colour you are, you need to be aware of issues that people deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palbinder Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, sir, it’s about understanding and appreciating difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharan Kaur&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What’s next?  Muslim officers for Muslim crimes?  Do you really want to separate communities like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palbinder Singh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sir, you can accuse me of separating communities, but your criticism doesn’t worry me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ch Supt Joanna Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, I guess my work here is done.  Are there any white victims of crime who need my help?  Anyone?  Guv’nor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Scene fades)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Counsel Torquil Paterson told the JSC: “I left the church for a variety of reasons, chief among them being that I realised God does not exist. I am an atheist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paterson, whose lengthy theological studies included a stint at Oxford University, explained he had eventually come to the conclusion that “all language of God is meaningless”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Minister Jeff Radebe was left perplexed and asked: “So what you read in the Bible about the beginning does not exist? You do not believe that we were created in the image of God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Minister you may believe that, I don’t,” Patterson responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radebe insisted, to rare laughter at the JSC ’s interviews of aspirant judges: “If God does not exist, are you a materialist, a communist, a Marxist?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paterson denied that he was any of those, adding: “It is a quite difficult to find a real Marxist”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAM! Stangely, the scathing criticism that followed didn’t even have anything to do with his being an atheist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocate &lt;a title="Dumisa Ntsebeza" href="http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/Pages/profilefull.aspx?IndID=1879"&gt;Dumisa Ntsebeza&lt;/a&gt;, one of President Jacob Zuma’s new appointees to the JSC, declared he was both an atheist and a Marxist. He then launched a scathing attack on Paterson for having failed to join Advocates for Transformation (AFT). Ntsebeza is the national chairperson of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! South Africa is crawling with atheists and not believing in any gods isn’t treated as immediate grounds to reject him. It’s seen as a lesser priority than actual issues. What kind of crazy country are they running over there? Next you’re going to be telling me that the politicians don’t hypocritically cheat on their spouses after making a whole production out of condemning others for cheating on their spouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s scary sometimes to think that Woopi Goldberg can be described as the rational one on The View. I can’t believe she pulled the “I’m just saying…” gambit with regards to the moon landing being faked. You’re not just saying it! You’re proposing that millions of people are involved in an elaborate coverup to manipulate the public into thinking something happened that didn’t happen. IT’S NOT A MINOR CLAIM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for the record, Phil Plait easily answers her questions &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/22/whoopi-doo/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions Whoopi asks aren’t hard to answer. No one took the footage of Armstrong’s first step (it was a camera he deployed before stepping off the ladder), and there was a video camera on the rover that shot the footage of the ascent module taking off (remotely controlled on Earth by &lt;a href="http://www.clavius.org/bibmilne.html"&gt;Ed Fendell&lt;/a&gt;). The flag waves because the astronauts were struggling to get the pole in the lunar surface (let a belt hang from your hand at arm’s length and move your arm back and forth; watch the belt ripple despite the fact it can’t be the air making it move).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc., and so on, &lt;em&gt;und so weiter&lt;/em&gt;, ad infinitum. &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html"&gt;Someone should point her here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it say when Barbara Walters is the voice of reason? Egads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad Buzz Aldrin wasn’t on the show. It would be hilarious to see someone on that show punched in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

First, let me say, thanks for sobering up and getting out of bed before 5 pm  long enough to read the blog. I love you all. XOXOXOX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I thought that you should read a couple of comments left &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/academic_standard_time_and_the.php"&gt;on a previous post &lt;/a&gt;in which I discussed the lunacy that is my life. Darling graduate school prospect and probably very good student Avery &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/academic_standard_time_and_the.php#comment-1790651"&gt;says the following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm very interested in having read this right before I start graduate school. In theory, I know that there's a lot of other things that my faculty are going to have to be doing while they're also teaching. I know that they're there to do research, and have their own labs and projects to do in those labs. And I know that a lot of them do a whole lot of running around trying to fit in every advisee, grant proposal, etc. they possibly can. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, as a student, as an undergraduate student specifically, I've had a lot of problems with professors that weren't helpful - whether because they had too much on their plate or because in all honesty they didn't really give a shit about the students. I'm paying for my education. In the case of graduate school, I'm paying a lot, and keeping my fingers crossed the whole time that I'll be able to make enough in my career to not be crippled by my student loans. I don't have a problem being self motivated, but if I need help I really hope that I'll have folks at my university I can get it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Which is not to say that I don't think that Isis is a good helpful person, or that I think there's any problem with her telling her student to come back on Friday, particularly if whatever his problem was on wasn't due by Friday and if she really thought he had what he needed to figure it out. Just that this whole topic scares me a little.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Distinguished Professor of Blogging Dr. &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey"&gt;DrugMonkey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/academic_standard_time_and_the.php#comment-1790831"&gt;replies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you choose a big, research intensive Uni for undergrad Avery, this IS what you are paying for. The faculty contingencies put the needs of undergrads dead last.

The Daily Mail reports:

    &amp;quot;A 10-year-old girl born with half a brain has both fields of vision in one eye, scientists said today. The youngster, from Germany, has the power of both a right and left eye in the single organ in the only known case of its kind in the world.

    &amp;quot;University of Glasgow researchers used Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to reveal how the girl’s brain had rewired itself in order to process information from the right and left visual fields in spite of her not having a whole brain.&amp;quot;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new book argues that scientists need to do more to promote their work to the public&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, at an Arizona state senate hearing, a Republican legislator named Sylvia Allen casually tossed off a statistic that, if true, would unravel the last 200 years of painstaking progress in geological research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on a proposal for a new uranium mine, she asserted matter-of-factly that “the Earth’s been here 6,000 years, long before anybody had environmental laws, and somehow it hasn’t been done away with.” The hearing was videotaped, and a clip of her remark was posted on the Internet, exposing her ignorance of basic science to a predictable chorus of mockery and disdain. None of which, of course, has the slightest chance of causing Allen, or other believers of the so-called young Earth hypothesis, to change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their new book, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future&lt;/em&gt;, Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum say it’s time to switch from the standard, tired prescription for solving the problem of scientific illiteracy: more, or better, science education in the schools. After all, many proponents of “intelligent design” are well educated in the language and methods of science. Instead of blaming the public for their inadequate knowledge (or, in the case of Allen and other creationists, willful ignorance) of science, Mooney and Kirshenbaum blame the scientific community and its press agents for the poor job they’ve done promoting their brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson's Edgertonite National Party is based on the Lauraist religion, a movement he created that believes Laura Ingalls Wilder is God and that the Lauraist homeland will occupy an area within a 240-mile radius of Minneapolis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"A new nation, to be called Edgerton, with its capital at Minneapolis, should be created on the land from approximately Hibbing to Des Moines, and from Fargo to Madison," says Wilson's campaign Web site.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Communism is the mode of government of said nation, with an abolition of all laws except those necessary for public safety.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wilson has written two books, "The Principles of Lauraism" and "The Conscience of a Communist."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wilson says he was institutionalized in the early 1980s because of his political and religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have also remembered that time that we had a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/01/and_you_thought_jesse_ventura.php"&gt;vampire running for governor&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, yeah, and the professional wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;

Several &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/07/21/india.solar.eclipse/index.html"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt; have covered the story that many &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090720/sc_afp/scienceastronomyeclipseasiatourismsuperstition"&gt;Indians fear the eclipse&lt;/a&gt; as a bad omen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CNN article, pregnant women don’t want to give birth on the day of the eclipse and there are even some critically ill patients who don’t want to be in the hospital on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the two demons Rahu and Ketu are said to “swallow” the sun during eclipses, snuffing out its life-giving light and causing food to become inedible and water undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian astrologers are going out of their way to make dire predictions about violence and fear that will rise in the wake of the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s killing me, guys. The news outlets are covering these things almost like they are fact.  More after the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the CNN article quotes “remedial astrologer,” R.K. Sharma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A solar eclipse, he says, weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He &lt;em&gt;explained&lt;/em&gt;? That’s an explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the sense that media tends to focus on the crazy in stories like this because at some level, we *like* to read about how those crazy furriners believe all that ridiculous stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I checked the Times of India for eclipse stories, I found &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/India/Total-solar-eclipse-dazzles-thousands-in-Varanasi/articleshow/4806910.cms"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three minutes and four seconds on Wednesday morning, an ethereal blue-grey darkness descended on this eternal city of light. To the east across the Ganga, it was like God’s own eye flashing in the sky above, giving pilgrims, bathers and eclipse-watchers in the jam-packed ghats sights they are unlikely to forget in their lifetimes. While clouds blotted out the view in most other places in India, the century’s most spectacular total eclipse of the Sun was witnessed in full glory in holy Benaras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/City/Patna/Nitish-does-cop-management/articleshow/4808562.cms"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; which talks about the difficulties with crowd control during the eclipse. It sure doesn’t *sound* like people were hiding from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/defying-folk-beliefs-indians-chase-the-darkened-sun/article1224055/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; too, talks about the various astronomers and stargazers in India who are ‘eclipse chasing’ and using the event to teach astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Astronomy is the easiest way to explain science to common people – because they can easily see the moon and the stars,” said Sunita Mukherjee, an amateur astronomer and spokesperson for the Athenaeum. The eclipse flight is a splashy stunt for the group, but most of its work is done in schools, trying to interest kids in science through looking at the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there superstitious people in India who are scared of the eclipse? Probably. But as with anything, let’s be skeptical and not assume it’s all of them!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248311410109"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14102">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d40f1d32c89156b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Failed Activities for Atheist Groups</title><published>2009-07-23T01:00:52Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T01:00:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/22/failed-activities-for-atheist-groups/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;School will start up again shortly and atheist campus group leaders are planning out activities for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

The amendments were snuck onto an utterly unrelated bill that can't be voted against (a bill to SUPPORT THE TROOP... can't vote against that).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of these limitations is to keep the hate crime bill from affecting people who want to do bad things to gay people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Sessions gave a speech explaining that he does not believe the current hate-crimes laws should be extended to include gender identity and sexual orientation protections.

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"I don't think that our focus here is to deal with symbolic legislation that's broad and could expand federal criminal jurisdiction beyond its historic role and where the facts do not support the need."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how would that apply, say, to slavery and sufferage?  I mean, really Senator, "historic role?"  &lt;/p&gt;

I am not about to dump into the water---the "lean" is proper solo canoeing posture.  A few &lt;s&gt;years&lt;/s&gt; decades back, I was the canoeing director at a Canadian summer camp and taught hundreds of kids how to paddle a canoe.  Since this is a "science blog", I'll explain this awkward-seeming posture to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper position for traditional Canandian-style solo paddling is half-way between the bow and the stern, leaning to the side you paddle on, preferably on your knees.  The lean itself accomplishes two things: it brings you closer to the water, making paddling easier, and it lifts a substantial portion of the hull out of the water.  Less hull in the water means less resistance to forward motion and to turns.  You kneel, rather than sit on the (decorative) seat so that you have a low center of gravity and wide base of support---canoes are rather tippy vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once seated thus, paddle in hand, you can achieve complete control of the canoe.  The position described puts you at the fulcrum of the canoe, and your paddle is a powerful lever.  To pull your paddle straight into the canoe is called a "draw" (the opposite of a draw stroke is often called a push-away).  If you draw right at the fulcrum, you will move (approximately) sideways.  If you reach behind you and draw, you will pivot the stern of the canoe toward your side, turning the canoe to the "outside" (away from your paddling side).  Reach forward and draw, and your canoe pivots the other way.  You may wish to refer to my well-rendered schematic.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/07/no_im_not_tipping/canoe%20mechanics.JPG" width="420" height="384" alt="canoe mechanics.JPG"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Understanding the pivot allows you to move forward in a straight line without switching sides.  A standard forward paddle stroke (known as a "bow stroke") turns you to the outside and makes you look rather silly if your objective is forward motion.  A deceptively simple twist of the paddle at the end of a bow stroke turns it into a J-stroke. The end of the J-stroke is a "push-away", so the first part of the stroke turns you to the outside, the last part pivots you back to the inside. When executed well, the result is smooth, forward motion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While achieving perfect control of the canoe may take a while to master, the basic concepts are reasonably simple and easy to build upon.  For example, when paddling into a strong wind, it often helps to move yourself forward in the canoe, allowing the bow to "cut" through the waves (also increasing the drag so that the wind doesn't push you around---a sort of "flag in the wind" phenomenon).  With the fulcrum moved forward, however, you must reach much further backward with your J-stroke in order to go straight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just a wee bit of science, you can figure out how to make a canoe do what you want it to.  How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/no_im_not_tipping.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/xRj_dy8ST9I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248307530019"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_180.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/674e3107fc8643ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-07-23T00:13:09Z</published><updated>2009-07-23T00:13:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/CE82nvAnnjA/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_180.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_180.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=7&amp;amp;day=23&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;9 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006357" title=""&gt;Numbers in the Blind's 'Eye'&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although lacking visual experience with numerosities, recent evidence shows that the blind perform similarly to sighted persons on numerical comparison or parity judgement tasks. In particular, on tasks presented in the auditory modality, the blind surprisingly show the same effect that appears in sighted persons, demonstrating that numbers are represented through a spatial code, i.e. the Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect. But, if this is the case, how is this numerical spatial representation processed in the brain of the blind? Here we report that, although blind and sighted people have similarly organized numerical representations, the attentional shifts generated by numbers have different electrophysiological correlates (sensorial N100 in the sighted and cognitive P300 in the blind). These results highlight possible differences in the use of spatial representations acquired through modalities other than vision in the blind population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006362" title=""&gt;Adaptive Radiation in Mediterranean Cistus (Cistaceae)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adaptive radiation in Mediterranean plants is poorly understood. The white-flowered Cistus lineage consists of 12 species primarily distributed in Mediterranean habitats and is herein subject to analysis. We conducted a "total evidence" analysis combining nuclear (ncpGS, ITS) and plastid (trnL-trnF, trnK-matK, trnS-trnG, rbcL) DNA sequences and using MP and BI to test the hypothesis of radiation as suggested by previous phylogenetic results. One of the five well-supported lineages of the Cistus-Halimium complex, the white-flowered Cistus lineage, comprises the higher number of species (12) and is monophyletic. Molecular dating estimates a Mid Pleistocene (1.04±0.25 Ma) diversification of the white-flowered lineage into two groups (C. clusii and C. salviifolius lineages), which display asymmetric characteristics: number of species (2 vs. 10), leaf morphologies (linear vs. linear to ovate), floral characteristics (small, three-sepalled vs. small to large, three- or five-sepalled flowers) and ecological attributes (low-land vs. low-land to mountain environments). A positive phenotype-environment correlation has been detected by historical reconstructions of morphological traits (leaf shape, leaf labdanum content and leaf pubescence). Ecological evidence indicates that modifications of leaf shape and size, coupled with differences in labdanum secretion and pubescence density, appear to be related to success of new species in different Mediterranean habitats. The observation that radiation in the Cistus salviifolius lineage has been accompanied by the emergence of divergent leaf traits (such as shape, pubescence and labdanum secretion) in different environments suggets that radiation in the group has been adaptive. Here we argued that the diverse ecological conditions of Mediterranean habitats played a key role in directing the evolution of alternative leaf strategies in this plant group. Key innovation of morphological characteristics is supported by our dated phylogeny, in which a Mediterranean climate establishment (2.8 Ma) predated the adaptive radiation of the white-flowered Cistus.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_180.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/CE82nvAnnjA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248307014712"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14027">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37b48d88b0833927</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">How to Piss Off an Astronomer</title><published>2009-07-22T23:00:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T23:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/22/how-to-piss-off-an-astronomer/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Park Bench has a short collection of &lt;a href="http://theparkbencher.blogspot.com/2009/07/ten-questions-to-infuriate-astronomer.html"&gt;questions designed to infuriate any astronomer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

I feel a little awkward going on about this specific product (see Kristina's post on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_not_about_the_stuff_on_product_placement_blogging"&gt;blogging and product placement&lt;/a&gt;), but I do feel that the broader themes of accessibility, bringing AAC to the mainstream, and the value of AAC that is developed with the input of the end users are all items that make P2G writings go beyond plugging a product.  These broader themes may be why ABC News felt a feature was in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ABC News--here is the &lt;a href="http://www.news8.net/news/stories/0709/640918_video.html?ref=newsstory"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; (also embedded, and, warning, I was only able to get the video to play from the ABC News site in IE). Here is the full &lt;a href="http://www.news8.net/news/stories/0709/640918.html"&gt;transcript of the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the video-lovers, there are more videos of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=proloquo2go&amp;amp;search_type=&amp;amp;aq=f"&gt;P2G on youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good to see AAC hitting the mainstream news more and more.  The more ubiquitous AAC becomes in both the mainstream news and in the day-to-day lives of people--the more the public is exposed to AAC--the more that fear and stigma on the part of the public will erode.  It'll be a great day when AAC becomes as ordinary to people's sensibilities as eyeglasses.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248305134158"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/my_sister_in_law_just_got_abwr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09b285e3224ffbf8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anthropology"/><title type="html">My sister in law just got Abwrackpraemie</title><published>2009-07-22T23:51:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T23:51:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/xbiGBigWiV4/my_sister_in_law_just_got_abwr.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/my_sister_in_law_just_got_abwr.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, it is not as bad as it sounds, but it is somewhat contagious.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/my_sister_in_law_just_got_abwr.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/my_sister_in_law_just_got_abwr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/xbiGBigWiV4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248303215356"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/22/abstruse-goose-on-science-coolness/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fb61fa039c25e4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Abstruse Goose on science coolness</title><published>2009-07-22T22:10:32Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T22:10:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/22/abstruse-goose-on-science-coolness/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Three recent stories about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sexual_rights_sexual_abuse_and_the_question_of_consent"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; of individuals on the autism spectrum and/or with intellectual disabilities: a woman on the autism spectrum (in the &lt;a href="http://www.droitwichadvertiser.co.uk/news/4502650.Carer___s_sex_attack_on_autistic_woman/?ref=rss"&gt;Droitwich Spa Advertiser&lt;/a&gt;); a "mentally retarded" woman who is now 19 weeks pregnant (in &lt;a href="http://www.thehindu.com/2009/07/22/stories/2009072258050100.htm"&gt;The Hindu&lt;/a&gt;);  twin autistic boys who were 4 at the time of the assaults (in &lt;a href="http://www.candgnews.com/Homepage-Articles/2009/7-15-09/Maltese-accused-molester.asp"&gt;C and G News&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the really sobering thing in reading these stories---along with the fact that &lt;i&gt;caretakers&lt;/i&gt; committed the abuse in at least two of the cases---is that there are probably many more than go unreported and are simply not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A recent &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/education/20schools.html?ref=education"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article noted that not all teaching assistants---hired independently with funds raised by parents---are fingerprinted.

You see, Jackson was reportedly under the "care" of a privately hired physician when he died, and was being treated with medications not normally used outside the hospital.  I have a problem with this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/us/23jackson.html?hp"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to the Times&lt;/a&gt;, authorities are looking for records at the doctor's Houston office.  That's not a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not  a lawyer, and I don't know if: 1) the doctor was licensed to practice in California, or 2) if a doctor from Texas may practice in California on a Texas license (doubtful).  Certainly, a doctor may render emergency care to someone, one human being to another, but the use of injectable medications such as propofol and merperidine in an unmonitored setting seems pretty outside the norm no matter where your license is from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to practice medicine legally in my state, I must hold a valid physician's license, a valid controlled substance license, and in order to prescribe medications, a valid DEA license.  In order to avoid disciplinary actions, I must also practice in a way congruent with standard medical practice, for example, maintaining proper documentation.  The specific section of the Public Health Code says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; An individual licensed under this article shall keep and maintain a record for each patient for whom he or she has provided medical services, including a full and complete record of tests and examinations performed, observations made, and treatments provided. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doc was treating Jackson, he should have been recording Jackson's complaints, his own physical exam findings including vital signs, medication administration including amount, route, and timing---really, everything.  This is Medicine 101.  Of course, if he was practicing without a valid license, who knows what kind of paper trail he would or would not wish to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the news &lt;em&gt;crapnami&lt;/em&gt; that is the Michael Jackson story, one useful lesson might be learned; that of the fatal intersection of power, fame, and medicine.  It's not a new lesson, but one that may require quite a bit of repetition.  Unfortunately, I think we will have many future opportunities for review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/whats_up_with_michael_jacksons.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/t7_GhWiXeds" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248296906549"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14114">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7dc965bd43ddfca5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist/Christian Cooperation"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="Dating"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">An Atheist and a Christian: A Love Story… Update!</title><published>2009-07-22T21:00:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T21:00:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/22/an-atheist-and-a-christian-a-love-story-update/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote about &lt;strong&gt;Kate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Erik&lt;/strong&gt; a while back — they’re the atheist and Christian couple who &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/01/01/an-atheist-and-a-christian-a-love-story/"&gt;found a way to make their relationship work&lt;/a&gt;.

Who knows?) Panda’s Thumb photography contest. The winner will receive an autographed copy of &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/Why_Evolution_Works.html" rel="external "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Matt Young and Paul Strode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules of the contest are simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will consider any photograph that displays scientific interest but will give preference to biological, paleontological, geological, or cosmological interest.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Identify the subject of the photograph: common and biological name, mineral type, or geological formation, for example.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Submit photographs in JPEG format.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reduce photographs to an information content of 600 pixels horizontally. If creationists require a definition of information, they may apply in writing to the management.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Photographs may be enhanced but may not be montages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Submit a maximum of 3 photographs on or before August 8, 2009, to &lt;a href="mailto:u82PVdeCYtODV86:WuygXNCKaMuPU864Yx3RUMa7Z82PVdeCYtODV86:WuygXNCKaMuPU864Yx3RUMY+"&gt;[Enable javascript to see this email address.]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Depending on the number of photographs submitted, we may post the best submissions and ask our readers to vote for the best photograph.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;By submitting a photograph, you stipulate that you are the owner of the copyright and grant The Panda’s Thumb a nonexclusive license to publish the photograph on its blog.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Contributors to The Panda’s Thumb are not eligible to enter the contest.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The decision of the judges is irrevocable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The judges are irascible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Since we have never done this before, we reserve the right to change any of the rules, or add or subtract rules at any time at our discretion.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

Our lonely, pock-marked orbiter is pretty cool…even just to stare at.  And I’m obviously not the only one who thinks so.  The X-Change Files has already seen a couple of posts here on the subject.  At the risk of posting redundancy, I wanted to get my blog in edgewise.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Lp4tUE42nL4/SmdOlzNLF5I/AAAAAAAAAAM/xqqwEvIBUbo/s1600-h/apollo11_salute.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:320px;height:249px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Lp4tUE42nL4/SmdOlzNLF5I/AAAAAAAAAAM/xqqwEvIBUbo/s320/apollo11_salute.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I recently saw Duncan Jones’ new feature, Moon.  It’s clear to me that there must have been some serious cooperation between scientists and the creatives behind the film.  The setting both inside the station and out in the cold, vast lunar surface is as compelling as it is realistic.  As someone who watches television and film with an eye towards production, constantly considering “how’d they pull that off,” thoughts of miniature models and CGI didn’t enter my mind.  It was like they actually got the permits and shot there.  On the Moon.  And that’s what makes the Moon such a great setting for storytelling.  It’s another world entirely, but one within our reach.  There are folks walking the earth today, nine of them to be exact, who have traipsed across the distant lunar surface.  The Moon is a natural bridge between sci-fi fantasy and scientific reality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watching Moon, I couldn’t help but focus on the exterior establishing shots.  Staid, placid, perfect for the lifeless, monochromatic setting.  The perceived authenticity of these shots is one key element where the believability of this film could live or die.  A word on the establishing shot (probably unnecessary, but humor me).  Film and television rely on these shots to establish settings.  For the CSI series, they’ve become a hallmark of the franchise.  These flyovers open each episode and each act after a commercial, set the mood and convey the passage of time.  On CSI: MIAMI, we send a helicopter up over the city to capture ski-doos skimming by beaches, glass towers reflecting sunlight or the occasional gator darting for brackish water.  If we were to set a series on the Moon, what would be the equivalent of this type of dynamic establishing shot?  And more importantly, if we had to produce it from thin air (pardon the pun), how might we make it believable?  It occurred to me that we already have some pretty remarkable flyover footage from the Apollo Space Missions, though it is on the grainy, dated side.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I came across SELENE, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer.  A spacecraft launched in September of 2007.  Nicknamed “Kaguya” by the public, after a popular character in a Japanese folktale, the orbiter went equipped with a high-definition camera, complete with telephoto lens, as well as terrain cameras capable of capturing 3-D stereo imagery of the lunar surface.  Since early 2009, Kaguya has been orbiting the Moon, capturing the most amazing, hi-def and 3-D footage of any lunar orbiter before it.  Every nook, cranny and crater can be witnessed in striking detail and clarity, like you’re flying over it yourself.  So close, you could reach out and run your hand through the grey powdery surface.  CGI and miniature models are now totally unnecessary.  Sure, rights may need to be secured, but we actually have broadcast-quality flyovers of the Moon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I scoured the Internet for videos from Kaguya and found inspiration in one in particular.  The footage is desolate and haunting.  Lonely.  And it’s made even more chilling by what it depicts.  On June 11, Kaguya’s orbit terminated in a controlled impact on the lunar surface.  Its poignant fate was caught on camera, so to speak, as Kaguya transmitted to the end.   I know I’m anthropomorphizing Kaguya, but there’s something sad about witnessing this little orbiter’s final moments.  Watching the minute-long video, I find myself on the edge of my seat, holding my breath as its view of the terrain fills the frame.  As it glides closer and closer, just missing the peaks of craters.  Dropping further, toward the dusty surface.  No ski-doos, no gators, no bustling cityscapes.  Just rocks, mysterious shadows and loneliness.  And in that final moment before the transmission is lost, as Kaguya descends into a shaded area of the Moon and it becomes too dark to capture an image, the landscape just drops off to nothing.  Black.  A void.  Scientifically speaking, simply the absence of data.  For me though, watching this moment, science is more gut-wrenching than any feature or television show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In that instance, I forget that I’m watching an incredible scientific achievement and think only about Clint Mansell’s eerie score to Moon, the sad little robot eyes of Wall-E and the millions of earthlings back here at home watching as that final lunar establishing shot came to an end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/AxDNWXZpC3g%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-7946827489396791205?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

What's the difference? One small difference can be found in this story about &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/article1020144.ece"&gt;new pro-theocracy ads going up in Florida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billboards showcase quotes from early American leaders like John Adams, James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. Most of the quotes portray a national need for Christian governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't believe the founding fathers were infallible, so just digging up quotes from old dead white guys who liked Jesus doesn't impress me much. But wait! That's not the difference yet. This is the difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others carry the same message but with fictional attribution, as with one billboard citing George Washington for the quote, "It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"I don't believe there's a document in Washington's handwriting that has those words in that specific form," Kemple said. "However, if you look at Washington's quotes, including his farewell address, about the place of religion in the political sphere, there's no question he could have said those exact words."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opens up whole new realms of Biblical scholarship, you know. Maybe their god didn't say in these particular words in this specific form, "The fool says, 'There is a God'", but there's no question that those words could have been there, and it's certainly in line with the biblical gestalt.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m very excited about this, because I get to hang out with old friends, which is cool even if it means I have to work and moderate some panels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been asking what I’m doing when I’m there, so below is my sorta/kinda schedule. The two panels and the book signing are for sure, but the other stuff is tentative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:30&lt;/strong&gt; I’m hoping to drop by the IDW booth to soak up some &lt;a href="http://breagrant.com/blog/where-to-see-me/07/comic-con-3/"&gt;Brea Grant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:00 - 7:00&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll be moderating the Discover Magazine-sponsored &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/comic-con-2009-now-with-more-science/"&gt;Science of Science Fiction panel&lt;/a&gt; in Room 6DE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:00&lt;/strong&gt; The fabulous &lt;a href="http://jessicastover.com/entry.php?id=1202"&gt;Jessica Stover&lt;/a&gt; has invited folks to meet her near &amp;quot;the left-most entrance to the exhibit hall&amp;quot; which is a little vague, but she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; fabulous, so I’ll give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:00 - 6:50&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll be signing my book &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; at the Mysterious Galaxy booth (#1119). Here’s your chance to get an autographed copy of a book I have hardly ever said anything about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:15 - 8:15&lt;/strong&gt; I’m moderating &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/25/moderating-the-mythbusters-comic-con-panel-confirmed/"&gt;the Mythbusters panel&lt;/a&gt; woohooyeah! That’s in Room 6BCF, and even though it seats 2000 you might wanna get there early. Adam™ and Jamie are doing autographs earlier that day at 11:30 - 1:30, and Grant/Tory are from 4-5:30, both in the Sails Pavilion at table AA2. I’ll drop by to heckle them, no doubt. And maybe to fawn a wee bit too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing planned, but lots of Torchwood and Doctor Who stuff going on. That’s the place to look for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No specific day, just whenever I can&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get a chance, &lt;a href="http://forum.rifftrax.com/index.php/topic,11818.0.html"&gt;I’ll be looking around for the Rifftrax guys&lt;/a&gt;, too, and there may be a tweetup or two. Follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/torgospizza"&gt;TorgosPizza&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I’ll be &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/badastronomer"&gt;livetweeting&lt;/a&gt; as much as I can. If you’re not following me on Twitter, then whassamattayou?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see y’all there!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248295262952"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/is_this_thing_on.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20187bf12dcc7316</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Is this thing on?</title><published>2009-07-22T20:37:11Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T20:37:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/y0Jo42YaTVw/is_this_thing_on.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/is_this_thing_on.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/ID_N7rv-iN8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;height=265" width="320" height="265"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/is_this_thing_on.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/y0Jo42YaTVw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248295133933"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-7727454336262426341">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/959b3565b45d860b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Test Post</title><published>2009-07-22T19:48:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T19:48:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/test-post.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Please ignore this post, which will be deleted shortly.

of bad math. Orac is the guy who really motivated me to start blogging; I 
jokingly call him my blogfather. He's also a really smart guy, not to mention
a genuinely nice one (at least for a transparent box of blinking lights). So
when he sends me a link that he thinks is up my alley, I take a look at
the first opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Today, he sent me a link to a guy who claims to have put together
a mathematical model showing that it's impossible to create a national
healthcare system without rationing. The argument is a great example
of what I always say about mathematical modeling: you can't just
put together a model and then accept its results: real mathematical models
must be validated. It's easy to put together something that looks
right, but which produces drastically wrong results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The common way of saying it is "Garbage In, Garbage Out". I personally
don't like that way of describing it - because in the most convincing examples
of this, it looks like what's going in isn't garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

He lives in New Jersey where he is about to start graduate school at Rutgers. If you live in New Jersey you look forward to traveling, so Cody decided to fly up to Toronto for the day to collect his lunch. Because this was his first time in Canada, I decided to splurge and take him to a restaurant with white table cloths.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A filing Tuesday in federal court in New York shows that Baldwin owes $1.2 million in two mortgages on a property about 30 miles north of New York City valued at $1.1 million. The document shows he also owes more than $1 million in taxes and has about $70,000 in credit card debt.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t understand how his radio show for Christian teens, &lt;a href="http://bmxradionow.synthasite.com/"&gt;BMXRadio&lt;/a&gt;, hasn’t made him a rich man…&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this picture, I think it’s hard to tell which boy has issues. The one on the left somehow doesn’t look quite with it, at least to me. The one on the right is smiling broadly, his arm placed (protectively? affectionately?) on his brother’s arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/nedandalex.jpg" alt="Ned and Alex in Provincetown" width="360" height="480"&gt;I think people don’t always know something is different about Alex. In a good photo, like this one, he looks entirely typical. It’s a frozen moment, and I think he was happy to be with his brother and his parents on vacation in Cape Cod. But in real life, with the swirl of autistic traits and symptoms, it’s pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we get on a bus, I’m usually kind of relieved that Alex is doing something odd: pulling his t-shirt over his face, walking bent over and combing his hair, chattering and holding a plastic animal. There’s no way the bus driver is going to make me pay the fare for a boy doing those things, and at $2.25, those rides add up. (We are looking into a reduced-fare card for Alex based on disability, but it’s not clear if they treat developmental disabilities as a qualifying condition.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have such mixed feelings about this picture. I love the image of my boys together. I feel bad about how much I love this picture of Alex in which he looks typical. Confident and happy. It seems to illustrate how just a few clusters of cells in the wrong place, or extra, or missing altogether can make one boy stand and smile while the other stoops and grimaces. Of course Alex has these times where he seems just so typical. And those are the times when I think, Well, I guess his wheelchair is on the inside. At least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What skeptical project are you working on and do you need help on it? (everyone has one, just not the time to finish it)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’m not positive everyone has a skeptical project, I’ll add this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Big Idea do you have (preferably skeptical/sciencey) that you’ve yet to make happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It may also be breaking comments in IE as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fucking Internet Explorer... WTF...  Anyway, the blog may be unstable for the next little while as I try to fix this.  Goddamn it..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; It works in IE8, but not in any version before that.  It also seems to fail in versions of Opera prior to 9.8.  So it looks like some of the Javascript I used is fairly new.  (Although, it works fine in both Firefox 0.9.3 and Chrome 0.4.154.33 -- even though Firefox 2 came out around the same time as IE7.  Just sayin'.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm thinking it should be possible to either a) detect whether it's going to work or b) failing that, detect the most common too-old browsers&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and insert a fallback.  The fallback in this case would likely be that &lt;i&gt;every single post&lt;/i&gt; will have a "Continue reading..." link, regardless of whether there is anything below the fold or not.  Boo, hiss!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;I adamantly refuse to detect browsers I know are compatible, and then use the fallback if the browser is unrecognized.  I have an ideological problem with this.  If the website doesn't recognize the browser, it should (maybe) warn the user, and then chuck the HTML at 'em anyway.  If it works, great.  If it doesn't, use a different browser.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3411207526238866003?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248291522850"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-4132168012998574120">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/138446a3c0e7d7d1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="programming" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Blogging via text message</title><published>2009-07-22T18:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T18:39:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/blogging-via-text-message.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">The problem with blogging via text message is that Verizon always puts &amp;quot;This message sent using yada yada&amp;quot; at the end.

A bloke walks into a pub, and asks for a pint of Adenosinetriphosphate. The barman says &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;ll be 80p (ATP) please!&amp;quot;

Some genetic researchers were studying Acinonyx jubatus to find out why he had a high abnormal sperm count. They gave a group of these animals a histocompatibility (tissue-type) test.

"This is singular," observed one to the other. "Every one of these cats gave the same answers."

There are some happy sciences, but others are not so happy. A case in point concerns embryologists who tend to be a morose and saddened group than most. No wonder. One of the first things they learn is that our lives are ova before they've begun.

A red blood cell walked into a busy restaurant. The hostess asked, "Would you like to sit at the bar?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The red cell answered, "No thanks, I'll just circulate.

They were the first to attempt to colonize Mars. They knew it would be difficult , but they were determined to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They had landed with grass seeds to plant and embryos of horse, sheep and cattle. But the grass wouldn't grow, and none of the calves survived. The horses and sheep were doing well, but there not enough animals to meet their needs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So they sent a message to earth asking for more sheep and horses and a replacement for the cattle and grass. They particularly wanted an animal that could be used as meat in place of beef.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Earth radioed back asking if venison would be satisfactory and the colonists replied it was.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Finally a space shuttle arrived with the needed supplies. The bill of lading was rushed to the leader of the colony who then spoke to his consul, "we got everything we asked for," he shouted. . . .

Maybe. It's so hard to tell given how much idiocy I've seen about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, it's really, really hard to believe me when I say that what follows deserves to leap right up to the top ranks of brain-melting moronicity. After all, over the last four years, I've delved into the deepest, darkest chasms of pure anti-vaccine stupid. I've subjected myself to the incredible idiocy that is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/05/jenny_mccarthy_shows_off_her_knowledge_o.php"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/the_price_of_antivaccination_fanaticism.php"&gt;Kent Heckenlively&lt;/a&gt;. I've delved into the most vile cesspits of anti-vaccine propaganda, cesspits so full of misinformation and lies that the foul stench threatens to permeate my brain and make me stupid too. I've done all of that, all just for you. Even so, I've never come across anything quite this dumb. We're talking beyond black holes of stupid here. This is such a toxic mix of anti-vaccine lunacy and religion that I just don't know what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Theresa Deisher, Ph.D. She thinks that &lt;a href="http://all.org/newsroom_judieblog_response.php?id=2687"&gt;aborted fetal DNA in vaccines is linked to autism&lt;/a&gt;. She is also a hypernova throwing out enough burning stupid to vaporize a galaxy and cleanse it of all science, reason, and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to skip the standard boilerplate rhetoric about the "autism epidemic." True, Deisher seems to accept the science that shows that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. It's not because of science or reason that she appears to accept that science, however. It's because she apparently thinks something else is the cause, something that she is crusading about, something about which she drops a stinkbomb of brain-sucking stupidity over:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/thermonuclear_stupid_about_vaccines_from.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/thermonuclear_stupid_about_vaccines_from.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/1LLtw88BibE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248289115376"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/in_the_name_of_balance.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ad9c61238953a21</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">In the name of balance</title><published>2009-07-22T17:48:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T17:48:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/T0_2h0LbCdc/in_the_name_of_balance.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/in_the_name_of_balance.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/VIaV8swc-fo%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important discovery, but what intrigues me most about it is how the discovery was made. It is a story of two kinds of science, both of which are essential to getting a deeper understanding of life, but which today are staggeringly out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, Jane Goodall carried out some of the first long-term studies on chimpanzees in the wild. Goodall made important observations, noting that chimpanzees can be surprisingly cooperative but also quite violent, with troops engaging in war-like conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodall’s research was part of a long tradition of going to where the animals are, and tracking them for years on end. Goodall didn’t take giant crates of lab equipment with her to Tanzania; instead, she brought patience and careful observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, doing this sort of science poses some serious challenges. Field biologists often end up studying relatively few individual animals, because they’re so hard to find. Small sample sizes always make sweeping generalizations risky. Animals in the wild are also embedded in a marvelously complex environment. They are influenced by a vast number of variables–the weather, the food supply, the latest disease outbreak, the latest kerfuffle between the top male and his younger rivals. The state of an animal at any moment may be influenced by many of these variables, making it even harder to uncover important underlying rules of its natural history. And since this kind of science takes so long, it can seem meager if you only learn about it through the papers that the scientists publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast between Goodall’s kind of science and, what goes on in, say, a virology lab is enormous. Instead of just watching viruses, scientists can run experiments to test hypotheses–experiments that are controlled with exquisite precision. Scientists can genetically alter viruses to discover how each bit of its genetic material helps (or doesn’t help) it infect its host. They can carefully select the hosts to infect, comparing two sets of hosts for instance that might differ only in one particular cell receptor. They can trace the virus’s journey through the cell and out again; they can sequence viral genes as easily as you might crack open a fortune cookie. And they can churn out many papers a year on what they discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divide between these different kinds of biology has existed for decades, as I wrote in &lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020156"&gt;this essay&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;. That divide has led to some unfortunate biases. Natural history is sometimes treated like glorified butterfly-collecting. Meanwhile, lab-based molecular biology is sometimes seen as sterile and pointlessly reductionist. But it would be a mistake for one side to think it could live without the other. Understanding the origin of AIDS is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, an estimated 33 million people worldwide had HIV infections, and an estimated 3.1 million people were dying of AIDS-related causes every year. Yet, as diseases go, HIV is a latecomer. Scientists only became aware of it in the early 1980s, when it was still relatively rare, after which it swiftly became a global epidemic. Scientists have tried to search through medical records and blood samples for earlier cases of HIV infection that might have been overlooked. The earliest sample of HIV comes from a blood sample taken from a patient in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mysterious appearance of HIV led to many speculations about where it came from–including accusations that vaccination campaigns introduced it into people with vaccines contaminated with a monkey virus. But when scientists reconstruct the evolutionary tree of the virus and its relatives, they can reject those claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/hiv440.jpg" alt="hiv440.jpg" align="left"&gt;As soon as scientists discovered HIV, it was clear that it belonged to a group known as the lentiviruses. Lentiviruses are small particles with spiky knobs on their surface, and they encode their genes in RNA. They infect mammals, such as cats, horses, and primates, typically invading certain types of white blood cells. Genetic studies revealed that HIV is most closely related to strains of lentivirus that infect monkeys and apes–known as simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV for short. HIV is not actually a single lineage. It is several different strains with different origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main forms of HIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2, which is relatively mild, evolved from SIV that live in a monkey called the sooty mangabey. The story of HIV-1, which  causes the vast majority of AIDS cases, is more complicated, as this diagram shows. (It comes from my upcoming book, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/02/the-tangled-bank-the-best-eo-wilson/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) This tree reveals that it is actually several strains, all of which jumped from chimpanzees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists first discovered SIV in chimpanzees by looking at captive animals. But in order to get a sense of the true diversity of the virus, they had to leave the relative comforts of laboratories and head out to the places where chimpanzees live. Wild chimpanzees don’t take very well to a blood draw, so scientists developed methods for extracting virus DNA from the feces chimpanzees leave behind. But in order to find those chimp feces, you have to find the chimps (and the trees in which they spend the night).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These studies showed that two subspecies of chimpanzees carry SIV, but HIV-1 has only evolved from one,&lt;em&gt; P. troglodytes trogloydytes&lt;/em&gt;, found in west Africa around Kinshasa (marked Ptt on this tree). Goodall’s central African chimpanzees, &lt;em&gt;Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii&lt;/em&gt;, have SIV of their own (Pts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/siv-map.jpg" alt="siv-map.jpg" align="left"&gt;These studies indicate that SIV evolved into HIV as hunters killed apes and monkeys to sell in a growing “bush-meat” industry. Viruses in the blood of the primates could have entered cuts in the skin of the hunters, where a few of them mutated and evolved adaptations to their new host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the structure of the HIV tree allows scientists to pinpoint those adaptations. It turns out, for example, that as all three strains of HIV-1 evolved from chimp virus ancestors, they all acquired the same new amino acid in the same position in the same protein. No strain of SIV in chimpanzees produces that amino acid. This mutation altered a gene encoding the shell of the virus, and experiments suggest that it was crucial to the success of the new HIV strains in humans. It’s possible that the mutation allowed the virus to do a better job of manipulating its new hosts into building new copies of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, AIDS is more than just a virus. Once a person is infected with HIV, it may take years for the virus to wipe out his or her immune system, allowing a menagerie of parasites to move in. When scientists studied captive chimpanzees infected with SIV, they didn’t see anything that looked like AIDS. This was intriguing to say the least. Perhaps the chimpanzees and the viruses had coevolved to a peaceful coexistence. When HIV-1 jumped to humans, its evolution took a nasty turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about chimpanzees out in the real world? Do they get AIDS? That’s a very short question that has taken a very long time to answer. A team of scientists set up shop at Jane Goodall’s study site in Gombe National Park, and took advantage of her decades of field work to track 94 individual chimpanzees for nine years. They searched chimpanzee feces for SIV, and then kept track of the chimpanzees themselves, observing their health, their offspring, and their lifespan. When the chimpanzees died, the scientists autopsied them to see what effect, if any, SIV had on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7254/abs/nature08200.html?lang=en"&gt;published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; are stark. Out of the 94 chimpanzees, 17 had SIV. The SIV-infected chimpanzees had a mortality rate 10 to 16 times higher than the uninfected chimpanzees. Fewer infected female chimpanzees gave birth than uninfected ones, and none of their babies survived to a year. Pathologists found that dead infected chimpanzees looked like they had AIDS, with a lower level of immune cells called CD4+ T cells and damaged lymph tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery raises all sorts of questions. The Gombe chimps get sick, but not as sick as humans do from HIV-1. Why? There’s no evidence that SIV jumped into humans from &lt;em&gt;P. t. schweinfurthii.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, it jumped three or more times from &lt;em&gt;P. t. troglodytes.&lt;/em&gt; As far as anyone knows, those chimpanzees don’t get AIDS. But, then again, nobody has yet published a study like the one that has just come out on the Gombe chimps. What will that study reveal, if anyone ever carries it out? Is &lt;em&gt;P. t. trogolodytes&lt;/em&gt; the source of a recent infection of both humans and the Gombe chimps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s particularly interesting, to me at least, is the fact that scientists had not noticed chimp AIDS before. Robin Weiss, an HIV researcher at University College London, and Jonathan Heeney of the University of Cambridge, published a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7254/full/460470a.html"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in which they suggest that the artificial conditions in which captive chimpanzees live protect them from AIDS. Out in the real world, where chimpanzees face an onslaught of pathogens, infections may activate the immune system in a way that brings on the virus’s attack and, ultimately, AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, only the slow-cooked science pioneered by Jane Goodall allowed scientists to discover one of the most fundamental facts about a virus that has become one of the most devastating scourges humanity has faced in modern history. Slow-cooked science may provide more clues in the future–but only if its value is recognized, and only if chimpanzees can survive SIV and all the other threats to their survival these days.&lt;/p&gt;

Rainier cherries were on sale for $2.47 a pound--an irresistible opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no get-in-get-out for me this time--before I'd even gotten a bag for collecting my cherries, I was confronted by crescents of fresh cantaloupe, "have some fresh cantaloupe, have a sample, please," a voice, connection.  Say thank you-- "Yes, thank you."  Good grief, that melon is good! "Melon is very good."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oooo, what are you?" the lady asked me.  "You have such an accent!  I'm Russian."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is kind of a funny moment.  Do I say, "Oh, I am apraxic!"  Or "I am autistic!"  Do I say, "I am Italian, but my 'accent' is just a speech problem?"  &lt;em&gt;What are you?&lt;/em&gt;  Always an interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of thinking about how much educating I want to do right that moment (none, all I really wanted was to plop those ripe, juicy cherries into my mouth) I answered, "I have trouble speaking."  I smiled huge, laughed a little, so that she knows I do not take offense.  It's a sequence of steps I've learned, practiced, repeat a lot.  I have a few versions of the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met recently with a lady with ALS who is interested in one of the speech devices I use.  I handed her my device with my "greetings" page open for her to play with and she pressed on "I can hear you just fine."  She started laughing.  She understood exactly why I have that message.  When I'm at a disability-related event instead of a fruit stand, or interacting with someone who has connections to the Deaf community, I get signed at just as often as spoken to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting example of how context and experience plays out in people's assumptions: my "accent" is assumed as coming from growing up as a non-English speaker to some, and assumed to be because I'm deaf to others, depending on what sort of culture one is attuned to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I long ago got over the childhood torment I'd been put through over my "funny accent."  It's just a fact of my life, and I have learned how both accept it and how to help others to understand and accept it also and move past it.  Learning how to effectively dispel various not-quite-right reactions to atypical communication is a very valuable life skill to me and to the people I interact with.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248286257908"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/2009/07/22/20-per-gallon-gas-wont-matter/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e71381d5a7652f67</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="tech"/><title type="html">$20 Per Gallon Gas Won’t Matter</title><published>2009-07-22T16:03:18Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T16:03:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/2009/07/22/20-per-gallon-gas-wont-matter/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was listening to Marketplace yesterday when I heard something that was so dumb that it offended me. It was an interview with a guy named Christopher Steiner, the full text of which can be found &lt;a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/07/21/pm_gas_q/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, about his book &lt;em&gt;$20 Per Gallon, &lt;/em&gt;which is about what will happen to society as gas prices rise. Some of the classics were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at $6 per gallon Americans will abandon SUVs forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at $12 we’ll all start living in urban condos and walking everywhere, roads will start closing and many of the remaining ones will start charging tolls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at $14 per gallon big box stores like Wal-Mart will go out of business.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many things wrong with this. First is the notion that gasoline could somehow get to $20. It assumes proportional demand. India and China will make a bunch of gas guzzlers just like we have, and want to buy just as much gas as we do. Of course, almost nobody in either country can afford to pay what we do in gas, and virtually none will be able to pay $10 per gallon. At some point in oil’s meteoric price rise those estimates, which are likely based on today’s gasoline prices, will all fall off a cliff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supply and demand is nebulous and impossible to gauge, so let’s just fast forward to a future where he’s correct, and that however many billions of BRIC dwellers suddenly have cars and the GDP per capita to bid gas prices up considerably higher than they already do. Then we get to the real reason the whole argument is stupid, which is that it assumes humans will adapt to the changing prices of gas by radically changing our lifestyles rather than developing new technologies to mitigate the costs. That’s like saying we’ll stopping having casual sex because AIDS is spreading. Despite the almost endless list of times humans were faced with technological hurdles and overcame them, this notion might just be mildly misinformed, rather than borderline-retarded, if not for the fact that those new technologies are already here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take ethanol, for instance. There’s a lot of controversy about it now because of government subsidies and the fact that it’s actually more expensive than gasoline for the same level of output without them. Those are true and valid criticisms, but it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more expensive and it still has to be factored in when discussing future gas prices. Unsubsidized corn-based ethanol already puts an upper limit on the cost of gasoline of somewhere around $5-$7 per gallon, depending on where you get your numbers from, and that’s rapidly becoming an outdated technology. We’ve got thousands of scientists at work on new biomass sources and production methods, but even if you discount that all as pie-in-the-sky optimism, our currently available ethanol production will stop the ascent of gasoline prices long before all Lowe’s locations turn to ghost towns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the even more exciting technology, electricity. We’ve already got usable electric cars on the road, with more coming out every year. There’s the Tesla. There’s the Chevy Volt, which is expected to get 50-60mpg when running on gasoline alone. There’s the new plug-in Prius.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric cars aren’t quite ready for primetime yet, but they’re close. Battery technology, which seems to be the limiting reagent, is rapidly improving. Our power-grid couldn’t handle everyone driving plug-ins yet, but we already have smart grid technology that could and we’re in the process of rolling it out. A process that would be sped up greatly by gasoline hitting $10. Nuclear power can provide us nearly unlimited cheap electricity, which again would advance quickly with high gas prices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the pieces are there, we just haven’t had sufficient motivation to pay for them yet. But given the choice between that and not driving our SUVs 30 miles to work every day, it’s pretty clear what the First World will choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge, Senior Counsel &lt;strong&gt;Torquil Paterson&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;amp;click_id=15&amp;amp;art_id=vn20090722010603666C471054"&gt;made this comment&lt;/a&gt; regarding why he left the priesthood to work in law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“I left the church for a variety of reasons, chief among them being that I realised God does not exist. I am an atheist.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paterson, whose lengthy theological studies included a stint at Oxford University, explained that he had eventually come to the conclusion that “all language of God is meaningless”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Minister Jeff Radebe was left perplexed and asked: “So what you read in the Bible about the beginning does not exist? You do not believe that we were created in the image of God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Minister, you may believe that, I don’t,” Paterson replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radebe insisted, to rare laughter at the JSC’s interviews of aspirant judges: “If God does not exist, are you a materialist, a communist, a Marxist?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paterson denied he was any of those, adding: “It is a quite difficult to find a real Marxist.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t read anything about the Commission kicking him out or deciding to vote against him because of his comments.  The remarks &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=76446"&gt;aren’t even mentioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in this other article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine if &lt;strong&gt;Sonia Sotomayor&lt;/strong&gt; said that during her confirmation hearings?  Even as an “accident” like she supported church/state separation because as a non-religious woman, she felt excluded when government promoted faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking there would’ve been a public outcry.  We’d be hearing about it non-stop.  Republicans would have gained enough support to find the votes to block her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone think otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else amazed that the judge’s comment in South Africa almost seems like an afterthought?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Henry Gee, the senior editor at Nature and blogger at &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog" title=""&gt;I, Editor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cromercrox.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The End Of The Pier Show &lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock.  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Thank you. It's nice to be here. Nice decor. Hessian up the walls. Very 1970s. I like the lava lamp. This sofa needs re-uphostering, though. The smell. I think something's crawled down the back and died. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself?  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Delighted. Fire away.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Who are you?  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Henry Gee mono crop_6156.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Henry%20Gee%20mono%20crop_6156.jpg" width="322" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Well, there's a thing. It rather depends whom you ask. To some, I am the Chosen One. To others, I'm the big fat bloke who's always in the way when they want to take a photograph of Cromer Pier. To yet others, I'm the man at the back with the dog. I have lived in all places. I have lived in all ages. Destined to wander the face of the Earth forever, I am the Eternal Champion, the Wandering Jew, the Scapegoat, the Highlander, the Serpent with a Thousand Young, the Seven-Headed Messiah. I am Bakrug the Great Water-Lizard, Execrated of Sarnath. I am all these things, and yet, none of them, the One-In-All. If you ever find out who I am, you will tell me, won't you? You might start by asking my wife. She might know. As for me, I haven't the faintest idea.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is your (scientific) background? &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;That mural at Yale by Rudolph Zallinger called '&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reptiles" title=""&gt;The Age of Reptiles&lt;/a&gt;'. That should be enough scientific background for anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up? &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Hang on - did you notice a solidus in that question? Did you? Two questions in one - very sneaky. So what's it to be - to do, or to be? Do? Be? Do be do be do? A lounge singer. Obviously. Mona Lisa. Buddy Can You Spare A Dime. All that old-school stuff. Ask me another.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;[takes call on iPhone] Really? Is that so? Amazing. Sell the unicycle! Do it now! What were you thinking of? Sorry - my real life job? Ah yes. I work for a weekly magazine called &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/" title=""&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;. You might have heard of it. It's quite well known. My father was terribly disappointed when I joined. He thought it was a magazine for nudists and that I'd give him free copies. You should have seen his face fall when I told him it was mainly about the release of calcium from intracellular stores, all of them fully clothed.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
But that was then, just after the relief of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" title=""&gt;Mafeking&lt;/a&gt;. Poor old Mafeking, he'd been standing outside the Men's Room for about a year and was hopping from foot to foot, fit to burst. Anyway, after he'd gone in I started as a junior reporter. After a while they threw me a few bones that nobody wanted, and for a few years I headed up the distant ancestor of Nature's online news output, as well as writing Nature's weekly press release, and handling all the manuscripts in organismal biology. I can't believe I had the energy. These days it's all I can do to handle just half our organismal biology submissions.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I also devised and edit Nature's SF column, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/index.html" title=""&gt;Futures&lt;/a&gt;. This has been going for ten years, and, like the proverbial Man from Devizes, has won an award. The European Science Fiction Society bestowed upon Nature the honour of being 'Best SF Publisher' of 2005. Nobody has yet come up to my face and said that everything Nature publishes is science fiction, but then, you can see my face from a long way off, and having seen it, you'd probably want to run as fast as possible in the opposite direction. If you were to ask me to summarize my job in a sentence, I'd say I was Nature's Senior Editor in charge of Sex, Death and Aliens from Outer Space.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most? &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cromercrox" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. If you'd have asked me a year ago, I'd have said the Acheulean hand axe, but, you know, change is fast in the field of communications, Web-2.0 and whatnot. You have to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work?  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; I have a large figure, as some have been indelicate enough to notice, and blogging has a figure to match. It's enormously important to me. As Winston Churchill wished to say in an address to the Free French: when he looked back at his career, he saw that it was divided into two parts. Being Churchill, he actually said this in French. His French was rudimentary to say the least, and what came out was 'quand je regarde mon derriere je vois qu'il est divise en deux parts'. Which went down a storm. Blogging has transformed my life, so that I can see my past sundered, as it were, by a cleft of Churchillian magnitude, behind which - that is to say, beyond - is a past, as if another country, in which blogging didn't happen. However, when I look back at Churchill's bottom, I see that a lot of the writing I've always done, right back to student days, when I should have been sweeping up the Emerald Bar (don't look for it, it isn't there any more) was, how shall we say, bloggy. I think I was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_cromer_henry_blogg.php" title=""&gt;born to blog&lt;/a&gt;. Blogging is my middle name. Actually, it isn't. My middle name, that is. My middle name is, in fact, 'Ernest'. I am trying to convince my children that the 'E' stands for 'Extraordinary' but they remain unpersuaded.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
It all started when &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/matt/profile" title=""&gt;Matt Brown&lt;/a&gt;, the London Editor of Nature Network, wanted to start a blogging platform. I tried to tell him that the thing he was putting together in his garage from a jam jar, three egg boxes, a recycled melamine kitchen worktop and several lengths of damp bailer twine loosely knotted together would never achieve powered, controlled, heavier-than-air flight, but Matt - bless him - was like all pioneers, eyes to the stars, feet firmly planted in mid-air. I couldn't bear to see the lad fail, so when he asked me to supply some hot air to give it lift, I could hardly refuse. I started blogging at Nature Network in February, 2007. The blog was called 'The End Of The Pier Show', but it's now called &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog" title=""&gt;I, Editor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://cromercrox.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;The End Of The Pier Show &lt;/a&gt; has moved to Blogger. I try to confine my Nature-Network blog to more-or-less scientific things, so I can devote my energies on 'The End Of The Pier Show' to right-wing politics and animal husbandry. This might seem a somewhat odd juxtaposition, but I can assure you that by the time you get to Cromer the distinction between them is moot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2007 I went to SciFoo, and that was another turning point. I remember arriving at the hotel, putting down my girrafe, and, resolving to conquer my inherent shyness, decided I'd go up to the first person I met and introduce myself. Especially if I could cadge a cigarette. (I still smoked back then. These days I only smoke through my ears). So it was that I met Bora Zivkovic. Perhaps you've met him? He is one of the most prolific science bloggers in the iSphere. In fact, he told me that the only way his mother can reach him is by leaving comments on his blog, in Serbian. Small world, eh? In fact, it was through blogs that Bora &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_the_cromer_menager.php" title=""&gt;visited&lt;/a&gt; Cromer, where &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_cromer_a_loooong_d.php" title=""&gt;I live&lt;/a&gt;, and that's the next thing - it might seem odd to have a meatspace conference about blogging, but there are times when you have to meat (sorry, 'meet') people in real life.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The Science Online '09 conference was great, as I met many US-based bloggers in person, for the first time, people like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/" title=""&gt;Abel Pharmboy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/" title=""&gt;Scicurious&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/" title=""&gt;GrrlScientist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/" title=""&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Flying Trilobite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/" title=""&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt;, and many others. It was meeting these people in person that got me interested in their blogs, so the horizons of my own particular blogosphere have broaded immeasurably since the conference, in a way that they might not have done. But because blogging is such a personal activity, the lines between the real and the virtual can be blurred. For example, I ran into Eva Amsen (&lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog" title=""&gt;Expression Patterns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://science.easternblot.net/" title=""&gt;EasternBlot&lt;/a&gt;), and we were both convinced we'd met each other before. We had to sit down and think it through very carefully before we realized that we'd never actually met. It was weird.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I heard that your session (co-moderated with Pete Binfield) about 'becoming a journal editor' was an ur-example of what an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_2pm.php" title=""&gt;Unconference&lt;/a&gt; session should look like. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;OK, you tell me. What should an Unconference session look like? Joking apart, I've gradually moved to an unconference style of presentation in most everything I do. This is partly because I'm sartorially confused and just plain bone idle, and partly because I have a horror of gadgetry breaking down mid-lecture. But it's mostly because, when I go out to labs and give seminars on what I get up to as a Nature editor, I've found that a rigid style of presentation makes peoples' eyes glaze over. Honestly, whenever anyone these days gives a Powerpoint presentation it's like Village of the Damned.  Instead, I just say who I am (honestly, many people are amazed to find that Nature editors are even vaguely human) and then invite questions. Frequently asked questions include how do I go about choosing referees for papers; the criteria I use to consider papers for possible publication; the politics of supplementary information; the status of open peer-review and free-access publication in the world today; how much they need to bribe me to guarantee publication; and whether I spilled their pint. So, as you can imagine, the time flies by.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
It was good to co-moderate the session with Pete Binfield of &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/home.action" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, because we complemented each other - I am concerned with the nuts and bolts of handling manuscripts, whereas he is a managing editor, concerned with strategy and the business side. I don't think people are always as aware as they might be of such distinctions. If you think of me as a Film Director, responsible for the editorial content, Pete would be the Film Producer, responsible for the financial and logistical backup.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I remember the session being packed out. I think some people had come expecting a fight. Before the session I definitely overheard people who might have been ticket touts, and gossip that included the phrase 'wrestling in mud'. I'm sorry if people were disappointed.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How was it for you?&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;The Earth moved, baby. Pity I've given up smoking.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;nothing in particular - just a lot of memories and the warm fuzziness of good fellowship; of having finally found, after all these years, the promises of dawns that turn out to be false and a past littered with the corpses of failed relationships, a community of people in which I feel I belong. I should stop now, as I'm gonna cry.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview.  &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;My pleasure. Do you know if the next bus goes to the station?&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;It does, but the train goes nowhere. I hope to see you again next January. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Do you now? I don't remember agreeing to a second date. But you seem very nice, and I'm sure I'll be free. What did you say your name was? &lt;/p&gt;

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006268" title=""&gt;Relativity Theory and Time Perception: Single or Multiple Clocks?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Current theories of interval timing assume that humans and other animals time as if using a single, absolute stopwatch that can be stopped or reset on command. Here we evaluate the alternative view that psychological time is represented by multiple clocks, and that these clocks create separate temporal contexts by which duration is judged in a relative manner. Two predictions of the multiple-clock hypothesis were tested. First, that the multiple clocks can be manipulated (stopped and/or reset) independently. Second, that an event of a given physical duration would be perceived as having different durations in different temporal contexts, i.e., would be judged differently by each clock. Rats were trained to time three durations (e.g., 10, 30, and 90 s). When timing was interrupted by an unexpected gap in the signal, rats reset the clock used to time the "short" duration, stopped the "medium" duration clock, and continued to run the "long" duration clock. When the duration of the gap was manipulated, the rats reset these clocks in a hierarchical order, first the "short", then the "medium", and finally the "long" clock. Quantitative modeling assuming re-allocation of cognitive resources in proportion to the relative duration of the gap to the multiple, simultaneously timed event durations was used to account for the results. These results indicate that the three event durations were effectively timed by separate clocks operated independently, and that the same gap duration was judged relative to these three temporal contexts. Results suggest that the brain processes the duration of an event in a manner similar to Einstein's special relativity theory: A given time interval is registered differently by independent clocks dependent upon the context.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006320" title=""&gt;Mobile Phone Based Clinical Microscopy for Global Health Applications&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Light microscopy provides a simple, cost-effective, and vital method for the diagnosis and screening of hematologic and infectious diseases. In many regions of the world, however, the required equipment is either unavailable or insufficiently portable, and operators may not possess adequate training to make full use of the images obtained. Counterintuitively, these same regions are often well served by mobile phone networks, suggesting the possibility of leveraging portable, camera-enabled mobile phones for diagnostic imaging and telemedicine. Toward this end we have built a mobile phone-mounted light microscope and demonstrated its potential for clinical use by imaging P. falciparum-infected and sickle red blood cells in brightfield and M. tuberculosis-infected sputum samples in fluorescence with LED excitation. In all cases resolution exceeded that necessary to detect blood cell and microorganism morphology, and with the tuberculosis samples we took further advantage of the digitized images to demonstrate automated bacillus counting via image analysis software. We expect such a telemedicine system for global healthcare via mobile phone - offering inexpensive brightfield and fluorescence microscopy integrated with automated image analysis - to provide an important tool for disease diagnosis and screening, particularly in the developing world and rural areas where laboratory facilities are scarce but mobile phone infrastructure is extensive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006166" title=""&gt;Climatic Changes Lead to Declining Winter Chill for Fruit and Nut Trees in California during 1950-2099&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Winter chill is one of the defining characteristics of a location's suitability for the production of many tree crops. We mapped and investigated observed historic and projected future changes in winter chill in California, quantified with two different chilling models (Chilling Hours, Dynamic Model). Based on hourly and daily temperature records, winter chill was modeled for two past temperature scenarios (1950 and 2000), and 18 future scenarios (average conditions during 2041-2060 and 2080-2099 under each of the B1, A1B and A2 IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, for the CSIRO-MK3, HadCM3 and MIROC climate models). For each scenario, 100 replications of the yearly temperature record were produced, using a stochastic weather generator. We then introduced and mapped a novel climatic statistic, "safe winter chill", the 10% quantile of the resulting chilling distributions. This metric can be interpreted as the amount of chilling that growers can safely expect under each scenario. Winter chill declined substantially for all emissions scenarios, with the area of safe winter chill for many tree species or cultivars decreasing 50-75% by mid-21st century, and 90-100% by late century. Both chilling models consistently projected climatic conditions by the middle to end of the 21st century that will no longer support some of the main tree crops currently grown in California, with the Chilling Hours Model projecting greater changes than the Dynamic Model. The tree crop industry in California will likely need to develop agricultural adaptation measures (e.g. low-chill varieties and dormancy-breaking chemicals) to cope with these projected changes. For some crops, production might no longer be possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006301" title=""&gt;Archaeogenetic Evidence of Ancient Nubian Barley Evolution from Six to Two-Row Indicates Local Adaptation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Archaeobotanical samples of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) found at Qasr Ibrim display a two-row phenotype that is unique to the region of archaeological sites upriver of the first cataract of the Nile, characterised by the development of distinctive lateral bracts. The phenotype occurs throughout all strata at Qasr Ibrim, which range in age from 3000 to a few hundred years. We extracted ancient DNA from barley samples from the entire range of occupancy of the site, and studied the Vrs1 gene responsible for row number in extant barley. Surprisingly, we found a discord between the genotype and phenotype in all samples; all the barley had a genotype consistent with the six-row condition. These results indicate a six-row ancestry for the Qasr Ibrim barley, followed by a reassertion of the two-row condition. Modelling demonstrates that this sequence of evolutionary events requires a strong selection pressure. The two-row phenotype at Qasr Ibrim is caused by a different mechanism to that in extant barley. The strength of selection required for this mechanism to prevail indicates that the barley became locally adapted in the region in response to a local selection pressure. The consistency of the genotype/phenotype discord over time supports a scenario of adoption of this barley type by successive cultures, rather than the importation of new barley varieties associated with individual cultures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006258" title=""&gt;Beyond Marine Reserves: Exploring the Approach of Selecting Areas where Fishing Is Permitted, Rather than Prohibited&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marine populations have been declining at a worrying rate, due in large part to fishing pressures. The challenge is to secure a future for marine life while minimizing impacts on fishers and fishing communities. Rather than selecting areas where fishing is banned - as is usually the case with spatial management - we assess the concept of designating areas where fishing is permitted. We use spatial catch statistics for thirteen commercial fisheries on Canada's west coast to determine the minimum area that would be needed to maintain a pre-ascribed target percentage of current catches. We found that small reductions in fisheries yields, if strategically allocated, could result in large unfished areas that are representative of biophysical regions and habitat types, and have the potential to achieve remarkable conservation gains. Our approach of selecting fishing areas instead of reserves could help redirect debate about the relative values that society places on conservation and extraction, in a framework that could gain much by losing little. Our ideas are intended to promote discussions about the current status quo in fisheries management, rather than providing a definitive solution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006236" title=""&gt;Understanding Oceanic Migrations with Intrinsic Biogeochemical Markers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Migratory marine vertebrates move annually across remote oceanic water masses crossing international borders. Many anthropogenic threats such as overfishing, bycatch, pollution or global warming put millions of marine migrants at risk especially during their long-distance movements. Therefore, precise knowledge about these migratory movements to understand where and when these animals are more exposed to human impacts is vital for addressing marine conservation issues. Because electronic tracking devices suffer from several constraints, mainly logistical and financial, there is emerging interest in finding appropriate intrinsic markers, such as the chemical composition of inert tissues, to study long-distance migrations and identify wintering sites. Here, using tracked pelagic seabirds and some of their own feathers which were known to be grown at different places and times within the annual cycle, we proved the value of biogeochemical analyses of inert tissue as tracers of marine movements and habitat use. Analyses of feathers grown in summer showed that both stable isotope signatures and element concentrations can signal the origin of breeding birds feeding in distinct water masses. However, only stable isotopes signalled water masses used during winter because elements mainly accumulated during the long breeding period are incorporated into feathers grown in both summer and winter. Our findings shed new light on the simple and effective assignment of marine organisms to distinct oceanic areas, providing new opportunities to study unknown migration patterns of secretive species, including in relation to human-induced mortality on specific populations in the marine environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006324" title=""&gt;Local Stressors Reduce Coral Resilience to Bleaching&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coral bleaching, during which corals lose their symbiotic dinoflagellates, typically corresponds with periods of intense heat stress, and appears to be increasing in frequency and geographic extent as the climate warms. A fundamental question in coral reef ecology is whether chronic local stress reduces coral resistance and resilience from episodic stress such as bleaching, or alternatively promotes acclimatization, potentially increasing resistance and resilience. Here we show that following a major bleaching event, Montastraea faveolata coral growth rates at sites with higher local anthropogenic stressors remained suppressed for at least 8 years, while coral growth rates at sites with lower stress recovered in 2-3 years. Instead of promoting acclimatization, our data indicate that background stress reduces coral fitness and resilience to episodic events. We also suggest that reducing chronic stress through local coral reef management efforts may increase coral resilience to global climate change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006346" title=""&gt;Hypocretin-2 Saporin Lesions of the Ventrolateral Periaquaductal Gray (vlPAG) Increase REM Sleep in Hypocretin Knockout Mice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ten years ago the sleep disorder narcolepsy was linked to the neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT), also known as orexin. This disorder is characterized by excessive day time sleepiness, inappropriate triggering of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone during waking. It is still not known how HCRT regulates REM sleep or muscle tone since HCRT neurons are localized only in the lateral hypothalamus while REM sleep and muscle atonia are generated from the brainstem. To identify a potential neuronal circuit, the neurotoxin hypocretin-2-saporin (HCRT2-SAP) was used to lesion neurons in the ventral lateral periaquaductal gray (vlPAG). The first experiment utilized hypocretin knock-out (HCRT-ko) mice with the expectation that deletion of both HCRT and its target neurons would exacerbate narcoleptic symptoms. Indeed, HCRT-ko mice (n = 8) given the neurotoxin HCRT2-SAP (16.5 ng/23nl/sec each side) in the vlPAG had levels of REM sleep and sleep fragmentation that were considerably higher compared to HCRT-ko given saline (+39%; n = 7) or wildtype mice (+177%; n = 9). However, cataplexy attacks did not increase, nor were levels of wake or non-REM sleep changed. Experiment 2 determined the effects in mice where HCRT was present but the downstream target neurons in the vlPAG were deleted by the neurotoxin. This experiment utilized an FVB-transgenic strain of mice where eGFP identifies GABA neurons. We verified this and also determined that eGFP neurons were immunopositive for the HCRT-2 receptor. vlPAG lesions in these mice increased REM sleep (+79% versus saline controls) and it was significantly correlated (r = 0.89) with loss of eGFP neurons. These results identify the vlPAG as one site that loses its inhibitory control over REM sleep, but does not cause cataplexy, as a result of hypocretin deficiency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006333" title=""&gt;Susceptibility to Infection and Immune Response in Insular and Continental Populations of Egyptian Vulture: Implications for Conservation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A generalized decline in populations of Old World avian scavengers is occurring on a global scale. The main cause of the observed crisis in continental populations of these birds should be looked for in the interaction between two factors - changes in livestock management, including the increased use of pharmaceutical products, and disease. Insular vertebrates seem to be especially susceptible to diseases induced by the arrival of exotic pathogens, a process often favored by human activities, and sedentary and highly dense insular scavengers populations may be thus especially exposed to infection by such pathogens. Here, we compare pathogen prevalence and immune response in insular and continental populations of the globally endangered Egyptian vulture under similar livestock management scenarios, but with different ecological and evolutionary perspectives. Adult, immature, and fledgling vultures from the Canary Islands and the Iberian Peninsula were sampled to determine a) the prevalence of seven pathogen taxa and b) their immunocompetence, as measured by monitoring techniques (white blood cells counts and immunoglobulins). In the Canarian population, pathogen prevalence was higher and, in addition, an association among pathogens was apparent, contrary to the situation detected in continental populations. Despite that, insular fledglings showed lower leukocyte profiles than continental birds and Canarian fledglings infected by Chlamydophila psittaci showed poorer cellular immune response. A combination of environmental and ecological factors may contribute to explain the high susceptibility to infection found in insular vultures. The scenario described here may be similar in other insular systems where populations of carrion-eaters are in strong decline and are seriously threatened. Higher susceptibility to infection may be a further factor contributing decisively to the extinction of island scavengers in the present context of global change and increasing numbers of emerging infectious diseases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006350" title=""&gt;Quality of Pharmaceutical Advertisements in Medical Journals: A Systematic Review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Journal advertising is one of the main sources of medicines information to doctors. Despite the availability of regulations and controls of drug promotion worldwide, information on medicines provided in journal advertising has been criticized in several studies for being of poor quality. However, no attempt has been made to systematically summarise this body of research. We designed this systematic review to assess all studies that have examined the quality of pharmaceutical advertisements for prescription products in medical and pharmacy journals. Studies were identified via searching electronic databases, web library, search engine and reviewing citations (1950 - February 2006). Only articles published in English and examined the quality of information included in pharmaceutical advertisements for prescription products in medical or pharmacy journals were included. For each eligible article, a researcher independently extracted the data on the study methodology and outcomes. The data were then reviewed by a second researcher. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. The data were analysed descriptively. The final analysis included 24 articles. The studies reviewed advertisements from 26 countries. The number of journals surveyed in each study ranged from four to 24 journals. Several outcome measures were examined including references and claims provided in advertisements, availability of product information, adherence to codes or guidelines and presentation of risk results. The majority of studies employed a convenience-sampling method. Brand name, generic name and indications were usually provided. Journal articles were commonly cited to support pharmaceutical claims. Less than 67% of the claims were supported by a systematic review, a meta-analysis or a randomised control trial. Studies that assessed misleading claims had at least one advertisement with a misleading claim. Two studies found that less than 28% of claims were unambiguous clinical claims. Most advertisements with quantitative information provided risk results as relative risk reduction. Studies were conducted in 26 countries only and then the generalizability of the results is limited. Evidence from this review indicates that low quality of journal advertising is a global issue. As information provided in journal advertising has the potential to change doctors' prescribing behaviour, ongoing efforts to increase education about drug promotion are crucial. The results from our review suggest the need for a global pro-active and effective regulatory system to ensure that information provided in medical journal advertising is supporting the quality use of medicines.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/eclipseglobe02.gif" width="500" alt="eclipseglobe02.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a total eclipse is typically only visible in a small region on Earth (where the blue swath is, above), a partial eclipse covers a much larger area (everywhere covered in red), where the Moon &lt;i&gt;partially&lt;/i&gt; passes in front of the Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 15, I got to experience an 88% partial eclipse.  With the naked eye, the Sun didn't appear to look any different.  (Yes, although I know I shouldn't, I look directly at the Sun sometimes.)  The Sun &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; different, because the Moon was blocking most of the &lt;i&gt;heat&lt;/i&gt; coming from it.  You, too, will notice that it feels substantially cooler during a partial eclipse.  Shadows look very interesting, as you see little solar crescents instead of circles:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/eclipse-shadows.jpg" width="500" alt="eclipse-shadows.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, you can always get a pair of eclipse glasses to see how much of the Sun is blocked out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/6A7E8051-9F1C-E663-776D56563C42F083_1.jpg" width="320" height="320" alt="6A7E8051-9F1C-E663-776D56563C42F083_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my friend wanted to know how to &lt;b&gt;photograph&lt;/b&gt; it.  There are lots of well known tricks-of-the-trade, and &lt;a href="http://www.mreclipse.com/SEphoto/SEphoto.html"&gt;this site is a much more comprehensive and knowledgeable resource&lt;/a&gt; than I am.  But one thing you definitely need during a partial eclipse is &lt;b&gt;a solar filter&lt;/b&gt;, otherwise you risk frying your camera.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/solar-filter.jpg" width="500" alt="solar-filter.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend didn't have one, so he decided to make one out of something he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; have, &lt;b&gt;a 3.5" floppy disk!&lt;/b&gt;  You remember those?  All he did was dismantle one:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/inside_floppy_disk.jpg" width="500" alt="inside_floppy_disk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And take the magnetic film part of the disk.  Then, like any good makeshift photographer, he held the film up over his camera lens, effectively filtering the light, just like you might do with any other filter:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/filter.JPG" width="500" height="246" alt="filter.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results?  Here's a normal exposure:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/6414_111501447095_671522095_2717666_2901615_n.jpg" width="512" alt="6414_111501447095_671522095_2717666_2901615_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And cleaned up a little bit, it looks like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_coolest_trick_for_eclipse/6414_111501452095_671522095_2717667_8101171_n.jpg" width="512" alt="6414_111501452095_671522095_2717667_8101171_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing how cheap, easy, and &lt;i&gt;effective&lt;/i&gt; of a solar filter this is!  The next time you get a partial eclipse, don't let the lack of a solar filter stop you from breaking out the camera and snapping a shot of it!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing about a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fresh_from_huffpo_antibiotics_cause_canc.php"&gt;new low of pseudoscience published in that repository of all things antivaccine and quackery, The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; (do you even have to ask?), on Tuesday, I had hoped--really hoped--that I could ignore HuffPo for a while. After all, there's only so much stupid that even Orac can tolerate before his logic circuits start shorting out and he has to shut down a while so that his self-repair circuits can undo the damage. Besides, I sometimes think that the twit who created HuffPo, Arianna Huffington, likes the attention that turds dropped onto her blog by quackery boosters of the like of Kim Evans. Certainly, the HuffPo editors seem utterly untroubled that, among physicians and medical scientists, HuffPo is viewed with utter contempt and ridicule. Certainly, I view Arianna's vanity project that way whenever it publishes the antivaccine stylings of ignoramuses like Deirdre Imus or cranks like &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=robert+f+kennedy+jr+huffington+post+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=david+kirby+huffington+post+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, and especially now that HuffPo's decided that antivaccine nonsense isn't enough and that it needs to "kick the pseudoscience up a notch" with its latest quack recruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, HuffPo has decided that even Kim Evans is not enough to bury its reputation when it comes to any form of medical science so deep into the mud that it would require nuclear weapons to blast it out; that is, if you even accept the contention that HuffPo even has a reputation for medical science. What am I talking about? I'm sure many of you know; you've deluged me with copies of links to this article. No, no, don't worry, I'm not annoyed. It tells me that you, my readers, feel that this article is something that so desperately cries out for a heapin' helpin' of not-so-Respectful Insolence and that said Insolence is what you desperately want to see applied to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Examples abound, for instance homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, the former of which is nothing more than sympathetic magic prettied up with science-y sounding terms and the latter of which is nothing more than faith healing given a New Age mystic slant based on Eastern mysticism and religion rather than Christianity. Indeed, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; was even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/noooo_not_quackademic_medicine_at_my_old.php"&gt;inspired by stories of Jesus' healing powers&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a trip into the wilderness for fasting and prayer, resulting in revelation. Another example is acupuncture, a modality that is seemingly more popular than ever, even invading the very sanctum sanctorum of the ivory towers of academic medicine and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/battlefield_acupuncture_revisited_only_t.php"&gt;hard-nosed halls of military hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, yet every study of which that is done under rigorous conditions with proper placebo controls shows it to be no more efficacious than a placebo. It's easy enough to shake one's head and chalk it all up to irrationality, ignorance of science, or even religious faith. However, I've always been dissatisfied with such glib explanations, even though admittedly I have myself used them on occasion--or even to what I like to refer to as "burnin' stupid."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why a study released last week in PLoS One by Mark M. Tanaka, Jeremy R. Kendal, Kevin N. Laland out of the Evolution &amp;amp; Ecology Research Centre, School of Biotechnology &amp;amp; Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, the Department of Anthropology, University of Durham, and the School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Fife, respectively, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005192"&gt;From Traditional Medicine to Witchcraft: Why Medical Treatments Are Not Always Efficacious&lt;/a&gt;. Besides loving the title, I also like the methodology, which in essence adapts the tools of modeling evolution and the spread of traits throughout a population and asks the question: Why do ineffective or even harmful (or, as the authors characterize them, "maladaptive") treatments for various illnesses and conditions persist in human populations? The results that the model shows are surprising and counterintuitive, yet to me they ring true. In essence, the authors show, using (mostly) reasonable assumptions that the most efficacious self-treatments are not always the ones that spread through a population and that even harmful treatments can spread. Both of these observations are entirely plausible based on the prevalence of usage of common woo and quackery, and what the authors have done, in essence, is to model mathematically why quackery persists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the authors set the stage:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/a_mathematical_model_for_the_persistence.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/a_mathematical_model_for_the_persistence.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101719"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.118258">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f42188ef8411a61</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alternative medicine"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="Quackery"/><title type="html">Fresh from HuffPo: Antibiotics cause cancer?</title><published>2009-04-21T14:45:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T15:42:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fresh_from_huffpo_antibiotics_cause_canc.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm really starting to hate the Huffington Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A colleague of mine asked a great question: if you have one question to ask a booster of so-called alternative medicine in a public forum, what should it be?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which he responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My answer: "Can you please give specific examples of alternative medicine theories and modalities that have been abandoned because they have been found to be ineffective?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to agree. If there's one difference between so-called "alternative" medicine and science- and evidence-based medicine, it's that ineffective therapies in general are abandoned. Now, I don't claim that it always happens as fast as it should. All too often it does not. Sometimes, in extreme cases, it takes the older generation of doctors retiring and dying off and the newer generation taking over. Nor do I claim that the process isn't messy. Scientific and clinical studies often take years to shake out, and in the meantime there can be a great deal of confusion. But make no mistake. Ineffective therapies &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; disappear in science-based medicine. The examples are legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now contrast that to "alternative medicine," where "ancient wisdom" is prized and faith-based "cures" are the rule. Is there any "alternative medicine" that CAM practitioners have ever stopped using because the evidence showed it not to work? I can't think of any. Homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, for example, have time and time again been shown to be nothing more than water and faith healing, respectively. Yet they are as popular as ever among CAM practitioners. That's why this is an excellent question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there must be others. What other questions directed at a CAM believer could limn the essential difference, the faith-based nature of CAM, for a general audience? For me, the question would be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What specific evidence would it take to convince you that homeopathy {or whatever woo the CAM practitioner believes in} is ineffective medicine?" Then I would press for specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments are now open for your ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/in_which_i_echo_palmd.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/in_which_i_echo_palmd.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101718"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.118167">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2da651df5b97ca61</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History"/><category term="Holocaust"/><category term="Holocaust denial"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="World War II"/><title type="html">In case you wondered whether David Irving is a Hitler admirer...</title><published>2009-04-20T16:40:29Z</published><updated>2009-04-21T03:46:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/in_case_you_wondered_if_david_irving_was.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Irving has made a career out of being a Holocaust denier and then protesting when someone calls him a Holocaust denier. As you may recall, he even sued Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt for correctly referring to him as a Holocaust denier in one of her books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what's on his website today. If you go to &lt;a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Irving's main website&lt;/a&gt; and click on today's newsletter, &lt;a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is what you will see as a flash screen before the website goes to the newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right! It's a big fat, sloppy 120th birthday kiss to Adolf Hitler, straight from David "I'm not a Holocaust denier" Irving! What was that again about not being an unabashed Hitler admirer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not even good history. Thanks to Hitler and his invasion of the USSR, the "Bolsheviks" ended up having the opportunity to rule Eastern Europe for over 50 years. If anything, after enslaving most of Europe himself for nearly six years, Hitler opened the door for the enslavement of Eastern Europe for nearly three generations. Not only that, but he did this after having started a war that resulted in the utter destruction of his nation's cities and much of Europe as well, a war whose wounds that have not yet entirely healed. In the process, Hitler took genocide to the most organized, industrialized level the world had ever seen, a brutal, bureaucratic killing process that, fortunately, the world has not seen since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is Hitler's legacy, and it's why I have a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/04/april_30_in_commemoration_of_f_1.php"&gt;Nazi-related holiday that I much prefer celebrating over Hitler's birthday&lt;/a&gt;.

About ten days ago, courtesy of J.B. Handley, the founder of Generation Rescue, who in order to have a couple of famous faces fronting his organization has allowed himself to be displaced, so that Generation Rescue has now been "reborn" as &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey's Autism Organization&lt;/a&gt; (the better to capitalize on her D-list celebrity yoked to Jim Carrey's formerly A-list (but rapidly plunging) celebrity), announced Generation Rescue's latest initiative in a post on its antivaccine blog Age of Autism entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/04/fourteen-studies-only-if-you-never-read-them.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fourteen Studies? Only if you never read them.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For me, it all started when Amanda Peet said the following in her "apology" to calling parents parasites:

&lt;p&gt;"Fourteen studies have been conducted (both here in the US and abroad), and these tests are reproducible; no matter where they are administered, or who is funding them, the conclusion is the same: there is no association between autism and vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, don't think Amanda Peet is alone, the mantra comes fast and furious from all sides...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These comments were driving me nuts. I'd read a majority of the studies they were referring to, I knew how bad they were, and I also knew that most journalists couldn't even find the studies being referred to, because most weren't even on the web!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several hundred hours of work later, Generation Rescue is pleased to introduce a website with a very simple purpose: to tell the truth. You will find every study in its entirety and a whole lot more right here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fourteenstudies.org"&gt;www.fourteenstudies.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive in, let me just point out right here and right now that J.B. Handley wouldn't be able to recognize good science if it bit him on the posterior. The same is true of bad science, because Mr. Handley simply does not have an understanding of the scientific method or the methodology involved that would allow him to distinguish good from bad science, anymore than I have an understanding of investment banking that would allow me to differentiate between various financial instruments. No, on second thought, strike that. I'm quite sure that I know more about investment banking than J.B.

I hope to see, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist"&gt;Isis&lt;/a&gt; would put it, some hot, hot science over the next three and a half days. In between sessions, I'll be putting the finishing touches on my &lt;a href="http://challenge.nci.nih.gov/"&gt;Challenge Gran&lt;/a&gt;t, seeing old friends, and possibly even blogging. The frequency depends upon (1) how many old friends I see and (2) how good or crappy the wifi is at the Colorado Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is it that to the right comparing Bush to Hitler was overblown and unfair over a great many issues, including the war in Iraq (a criticism that I actually agreed with, even though I was thoroughly opposed to the war--think &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/hitler_zombie/"&gt;Hitler Zombie&lt;/a&gt;), but putting Obama's head on a &lt;em&gt;Seig Heil&lt;/em&gt;-ing Hitler body is perfectly fine over taxes? In fact, I had thought of doing a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/hitler_zombie/"&gt;Hitler Zombie&lt;/a&gt; piece on the sign below (briefly shown in the clip above):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's pretty &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/even_the_hitler_zombie_wouldnt_be_able_t.php"&gt;standard (and brain dead) Republican fare&lt;/a&gt; these days. I thought it couldn't get worse, but I was wrong. Routine Obama/Hitler references aren't enough.

Specifically, I'm talking about how various news outlets report scientific studies involving so-called "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM), sometimes called "integrative medicine" (IM), the latter of which I like to refer to adding a bit of woo to make the scientific medicine go down. In general, because the press likes stories that buck the establishment, it tends to favor studies that seem to show that CAM modalities work. Even worse, it tends to misinterpret negative studies in the most favorable light possible, even if what is reported about a study and what is reported in the media about that study, all too often, related only by coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly egregious example was recently forwarded to me by a few of my readers. It's an article that appeared in the BBC entitled &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7998884.stm"&gt;Homeopathy 'eases cancer therapy'&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice it to say that the study being discussed concludes nothing of the sort, but that doesn't stop the BBC from writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some homeopathic medicines may ease the side-effects of cancer treatments without interfering in how they work, a scientific review has concluded.

&lt;p&gt;The Cochrane Collaboration said, while there were few studies, it did appear that some effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy could be alleviated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it's not. Let's see what the Cochrane Collaboration actually wrote, specifically &lt;a href="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD004845/frame.html"&gt;Homeopathic medicines for adverse effects of cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically enough, it was authored by practitioners at the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital (which, you may recall, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/an_embarrassing_critique_of_the_enemies.php"&gt;visited in the summer of 2007&lt;/a&gt;), one of whom is a member of the British Medical Acupuncture Society. What one can assume this to mean is that we don't have an Orac-like scourge of CAM writing this review. Far from it! These are likely to be true believers. (Otherwise they wouldn't be working for the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital, would they?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/homeopathy_and_side_effects_due_to_cance.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/homeopathy_and_side_effects_due_to_cance.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101715"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.117393">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f3cd72240c09c3a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antivaccination lunacy"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Quackery"/><title type="html">If you think anti-vaccine loons are just crunchy left-wing New Agers, think again</title><published>2009-04-17T04:00:14Z</published><updated>2009-04-17T01:26:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/if_you_think_anti-vaccine_loons_are_just.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the stereotypes of anti-vaccine loons is that they are predominantly left wing New Agey ex-hippie types, usually well-educated and affluent. Certainly recent stories out of California indicating that Marin and Sonoma counties are&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_the_outbreaks_begin_theyll_start_in.php"&gt; ground zero for declining vaccine rates&lt;/a&gt; would seem to back up that stereotype. However, there is a right wing religious variety of antivaccinationist, and it's hard not to point out that Representative Dan Burton (R-IN) is arguably the best friend the mercury militia has in Washington.  But if you want to get a true flavor of right wing paranoid whackaloon, you can't get much worse than a blog to which I was referred yesterday, that of the wife of Pastor Steven Anderson of &lt;a href="http://www.faithfulwordbaptist.org"&gt;Faith Word Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;. In her blog, Anderson's wife Zsuzsanna holds forth on &lt;a href="http://stevenandersonfamily.blogspot.com/2009/04/vaccines-and-population-control.html"&gt;Vaccines and Population Control&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We do not allow any of our children to be vaccinated. This decision was not based on emotion, but on studying the issue in depth over the course of several months.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you'll see, if this is the sort of "study" Zsuzsanna engaged in, I'd hate to see what she says when she doesn't actually look into an issue. If you really want to see crazy in action, watch Zsuzsanna go:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/if_you_think_anti-vaccine_loons_are_just.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/if_you_think_anti-vaccine_loons_are_just.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101714"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.117259">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5621441ee3eed276</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Skepticism/critical thinking"/><category term="Television"/><title type="html">Haunting a house in southeast Michigan: I think this reporter missed a possible explanation</title><published>2009-04-16T12:00:05Z</published><updated>2009-04-16T12:14:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/haunting_a_house_in_southeast_michigan_i.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For skeptics, TV news in my hometown sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it sucks for just about anyone with two brain cells to rub together, but it's especially painful for skeptics and scientists to watch. On one station last year, there was the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_orbs_invade_the.php"&gt;most credulous report&lt;/a&gt; I've ever seen about--of all things--orbs! It was presented as though these "orbs" in photos were actually ghosts or spirit presences, rather than the reflections from bits of dust in the air or on the camera lens that we know them to be. As I pointed out at the time, not even die-hard ghostbusters take orbs seriously anymore. They're so...1970s. Yet there was Ama Daetz gamely slogging through the story, interviewing credulous believers along with the token "skeptic" who wasn't even a skeptic, and breathlessly asking if these "orbs" could be evidence of life after death. One of TV news' prouder moments, it definitely was not. Then there's Steve Wilson, investigative reporter extraordinaire, who has completely &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/investigative%20reporter_steve_wilson_of_w.php"&gt;fallen for virtually every antivaccine myth there is&lt;/a&gt;. Worse, he's way behind the times, still flogging the mercury myth. Apparently the new Generation Rescue line of "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=289"&gt;too many too soon&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we.php"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;' hasn't permeated his skull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I became aware of another one. In this one, our intrepid newscaster has gone beyond mere orbs. She's found &lt;a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/video/19174567/index.html"&gt;what she thinks is an honest-to-God haunted house&lt;/a&gt;, and has the video to show it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not really.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/haunting_a_house_in_southeast_michigan_i.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/haunting_a_house_in_southeast_michigan_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101714"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.117134">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9770c8fa43d2d555</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antivaccination lunacy"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Bernadine Healy: Flirting with the anti-vaccine movement</title><published>2009-04-15T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-15T21:33:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/bernadine_healy_flirtin_with_the_antivac.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's an old saying, so old that it's devolved into cliché: Be careful what you wish for; you just might get it. I'm sure the vast majority of my readers, if not every last one of them, have heard this saying before. Certainly, it has a lot of truth to it. Sometimes it even applies to blogging. The most recent example that comes to mind occurred yesterday, when a commenter named &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/get_yer_jenny_mccarthy_body_count_widget.php#comment-1565729"&gt;David M&lt;/a&gt;. taunted me (or so he thought):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know you all like to pick on actresses, college students and parents with sick kids, but how about taking a look at the column by Dr. Bernadine Healy on U.S. News. She used to run the NIH, the Red Cross and basically is smarter and has more credibility in medicine than anyone who has ever played with their widget on this website.

&lt;p&gt;(Oh my goodness from a quick read, Dr. Healy thinks there needs to be more research on this issue, including vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. She must be a moron.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy reading and gentlemen start the slime!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/blogs/heart-to-heart/2009/04/14/the-vaccines-autism-war-dtente-needed.html"&gt;http://health.usnews.com/blogs/heart-to-heart/2009/04/14/the-vaccines-autism-war-dtente-needed.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I don't read &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/heart-to-heart"&gt;Dr. Healy&amp;#39;s blog for U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;. I probably wouldn't have been aware of this article for at least a few more hours (by which time no doubt some of my readers would have eventually forwarded it to me). I might have been spared its nonsense for a while. But noooooo! You, David M., had to go and make me aware of it, and then my curiosity demanded that I go to it and &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/blogs/heart-to-heart/2009/04/14/the-vaccines-autism-war-dtente-needed.html"&gt;actually read it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there are a few minutes of my life I'll never get back and probably a few thousand neurons I'll never get back after reading her article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/bernadine_healy_flirtin_with_the_antivac.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/bernadine_healy_flirtin_with_the_antivac.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101713"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.117089">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b7399c3910f940e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antivaccination lunacy"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="Quackery"/><title type="html">Get yer Anti-Vaccine/Jenny McCarthy Body Count Widget right here!</title><published>2009-04-14T17:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-14T17:21:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/get_yer_jenny_mccarthy_body_count_widget.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt; website &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/random_deserved_swipes_at_jenny_mccarthy.php"&gt;that I mentioned last month&lt;/a&gt;? Basically, it's a website that uses CDC reports and other sources of information to estimate the number of cases of and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. since Jenny McCarthy started her antivaccine crusade back in late summer 2007. The site points out that it is not blaming Jenny McCarthy for all this disease and death but that she should bear at least part of the blame for them because she has become the public face of the radical antivaccine movement. That's something I've been saying for a while, and something against which Jenny has tried to inoculate herself by, when asked about the decreases in vaccination rates leading to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in areas where the decreases have been the steepest, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/i_really_wish_this_were_an_april_fools_d.php"&gt;blaming big pharma for not making vaccines that are "safe enough" to her&lt;/a&gt;. Never mind that "safe enough" to Jenny McCarthy is clearly an impossible standard that no therapeutic or preventative measure could ever meet. In fact, it's an utterly disingenuous gambit, because time and time again Jenny McCarthy has shown that no level of safety, no decrease in the level of risk, is "safe enough" when it comes to vaccines, although, oddly enough, she doesn't mind &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/jenny_mccarthy_absolutely_loves_injectin.php"&gt;injecting one of the most lethal toxins known to humans into her face&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, thanks to Martin over at The Lay Scientist, you can now have a &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/510"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count Widget&lt;/a&gt; installed on your--yes, your--blog! Advertise to the world the price of Jenny McCarthy's idiocy every day. Choose from either the Antivaccine Body Count version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/510"&gt;&lt;map name="map2"&gt;&lt;area href="http://www.layscience.net" alt="Get Widget" title="Get Widget" shape="rect" coords="0,163,128,184"&gt;&lt;area href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/" alt="The Body Count" title="The Body Count" shape="rect"&gt;&lt;/map&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/vaxbodycount.php" alt="Jenny McCarthy Body Count" border="0" width="128" height="184" usemap="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/#map"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the personalize it with the Jenny McCarthy version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;map name="map2"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/510"&gt;&lt;area href="http://www.layscience.net" alt="Get Widget" title="Get Widget" shape="rect" coords="0,163,128,184"&gt;&lt;area href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/" alt="The Body Count" title="The Body Count" shape="rect"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/map&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/bodycount.php" alt="Jenny McCarthy Body Count" border="0" width="128" height="184" usemap="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/#map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, when I get around to installing the widget on my sidebar, I'll install the Anti-Vaccine Body Count version. As important as Jenny McCarthy has become to the antivaccine movement, she is not the sole person to blame for the decline in vaccination rates that risk more and larger outbreaks. The antivaccine movement existed long before McCarthy discovered it, and it will exist long after she finds some other "project" to move on to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/get_yer_jenny_mccarthy_body_count_widget.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/get_yer_jenny_mccarthy_body_count_widget.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101712"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.117038">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e0e82ac8ccce7c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alternative medicine"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="Quackery"/><title type="html">Why would naturopaths want to prescribe those evil big pharma drugs?</title><published>2009-04-14T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-04-14T15:01:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/why_would_naturopaths_want_to_prescribe.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, there's been a movement afoot among purveyors of that special brand of "natural" woo known as naturopathy to convince various legislatures and regulatory bodies that they not only are capable of serving as primary care physicians but that they should be allowed to do so. My first impression was laughter--that is, until I realized that the naturopaths are serious. For example, in New York, naturopaths, spearheaded by the &lt;a href="http://nyanp.org/"&gt;New York Association of Naturopathic Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, are lobbying to be given the power to prescribe medications. Never mind that, despite their claims to the contrary, their training is only a fraction of that received by real primary care doctors, whose specialties include internal medicine, family practice, pediatrics, and in some cases OB/GYN. They do not do the three or four years of additional training after they finish school, as real primary care physicians do. Worse, what they do learn in school &lt;a href="http://www.scnm.edu/college/scope.php"&gt;teaches them&lt;/a&gt; that homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, herbalism, chiropractic, therapeutic touch, and all manner of woo are effective. As far as I'm concerned, any medical "specialty" that accepts the One Quackery To Rule Them All, One Quackery to Find Them, One Quackery to Bring Them All and in the Darkness Bind Them (homeopathy) as a valid medical treatment, is not capable of applying science and evidence to the care of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first started noticing the issue a couple of months ago when I was made aware by Kimball Atwood and I started paying more attention to this issue after blog bud PalMD issued his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/naturopath_challenge.php"&gt;naturopath challenge&lt;/a&gt;. It's a devilishly simply ploy. PalMD, a real primary care physician, presented what should be to any primary care physician a relatively straightforward patient that any doctor might see in his or her practice and challenged naturopaths to tell him what they would do with this patient. Elsewhere, he issued a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=455"&gt;similar challenge, only with a different case&lt;/a&gt;. Thus far, the responses he's received from naturopaths have been--shall we say?--&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/naturopath_challenge--follow_u.php"&gt;underwhelming&lt;/a&gt;. One naturopath ordered a whole bunch of unnecessary laboratory tests and recommended a low carb diet and a whole slew of supplements without an evidence base to support their use. Not impressive. In fact, it made me very afraid of what might happen if naturopaths are ever allowed to function as primary care physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Canadians, &lt;a href="http://news.sympatico.msn.cbc.ca/Health/ContentPosting?newsitemid=bc-naturopaths&amp;amp;feedname=CBC-HEALTH-V3&amp;amp;show=False&amp;amp;number=0&amp;amp;showbyline=True&amp;amp;subtitle=&amp;amp;detect=&amp;amp;abc=abc&amp;amp;date=True"&gt;British Columbia is about to find out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/why_would_naturopaths_want_to_prescribe.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/why_would_naturopaths_want_to_prescribe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>Orac</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248281101711"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/insolence//17.117048">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/156e70d003f9da25</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Television"/><title type="html">Funniest commercial ever?</title><published>2009-04-14T04:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-04-14T02:44:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/funniest_commercial_ever.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You be the judge!&lt;/p&gt;

It's the last week of classes here; I have to finish a big pile of grading, and there's a hogshead of administrative work hanging over my head. I also chose, freely and of my own irresponsible will, to flit off to New York for a pleasant weekend with a mob of science nerds and English majors (and unholy chimeras of the two), which has put me even further behind. I'm stepping away from my thin metal and glass interface to the universe of the interweebles to get some work done. You'll just have to chat among yourselves about something or other for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be back later. I've got a &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; post in the works about my horrendous evil flight back home that I'll have to share with you. Well, the flight itself wasn't so bad, but it had Eagleton and Fish and Samuel L. Jackson in it, so it got ugly for a while. I shall purge myself of those evil thoughts once this pile of earnest, thoughtful student labors is converted into soulless but judgmental rows of numbers in a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/open_thread_frog_vent_the_blas.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/open_thread_frog_vent_the_blas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>PZ Myers</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248278436704"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/pharyngula//7.119573">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/213dc244ae7894ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Stupidity"/><title type="html">Proof that there is no god</title><published>2009-05-04T14:14:03Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T14:19:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/proof_that_there_is_no_god.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy, dangerous quack and ignorant fraud, has just signed a contract with that professional peddler of pablum, Oprah Winfrey, to &lt;a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/090504/entertainment/centertainment_us_mccarthy"&gt;put on a syndicated talk show&lt;/a&gt;, among other media puffery.

I can't blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one recorded sermon, Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Hensley, the chief of the US military chaplains in Afghanistan, tells soldiers that, as followers of Jesus Christ, they all have a responsibility "to be witnesses for him".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The special forces guys - they hunt men basically. We do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down," he says.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Get the hound of heaven after them, so we get them into the kingdom. That's what we do, that's our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's the business of the secular officer corps to hound these vermin with courts-martial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/why_do_we_even_have_chaplains.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/why_do_we_even_have_chaplains.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>PZ Myers</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248278436703"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/pharyngula//7.119565">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e065df65ddd2f645</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">There is no requirement that Molly winner’s names must begin with “J”</title><published>2009-05-04T12:29:10Z</published><updated>2009-05-04T12:41:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/there_is_no_requirement_that_m.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's May, which means I have to tally up all the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/its_springtime_for_molly_on_ph.php"&gt;votes you made in April&lt;/a&gt; for the Molly-worthy commenters in March.

This is a bad law that removes standards of professional conduct from licensed pharmacies, and further removes all liability from pharmacists who disregard the doctor's prescriptions for their patients. Well, some of their standards. Ema has a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing. I have a question for Rep. Ed Emery, Rep. Cynthia Davis, and all the other Missouri politicians who passed HB 226.

Look what can get you &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/corbett-religion-court-2387684-farnan-selna"&gt;in trouble with the law now&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mission Viejo high school history teacher violated the First Amendment by disparaging Christians during a classroom lecture, a federal judge ruled today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Corbett, a 20-year teacher at Capistrano Valley High School, was found guilty of referring to Creationism as "religious, superstitious nonsense" during a 2007 classroom lecture, denigrating his former Advanced Placement European history student, Chad Farnan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am astounded that Corbett was found guilty of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, he told the truth: creationism &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; religious, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a product of superstition, and it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; nonsense — it doesn&amp;#39;t fit any of the evidence we have about the history fo the world or life on it. We have to have the right to tell students not only that something is wrong, but that it is stupidly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we are being told over and over again that Christianity is not equivalent to creationism. This teacher has specifically said that creationism is nonsense, and this judge has equated a dismissal of a weird anti-scientific belief with making a rude remark about Christianity. So…where are all the Christians rising in outrage at the slander of their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, and this must be said, Chad Farnan is a self-righteously moronic creationist wanker who deserves to have his stupidity pointed out publicly, in the classroom and out of it, far and wide.

&lt;p&gt;Debates are bad idea because they tend to put ludicrous claims on an equal footing with solid science. Sometimes we have to do them, because you've got to bring the argument home to the enemy, but when we do, we &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; get a supportive crowd in attendance, too.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/05/weird_ped.jpeg" width="400" height="205" alt="weird_ped.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit of a stumper. There&amp;#39;s the problem of variability in its expression, whatever it is, which makes interpretation a little fuzzy — that&amp;#39;s a good lesson in itself, that genetics isn&amp;#39;t always a matter of rigid absolutes. They usually think, though, that it must be some Y-linked trait, since only males (the squares in the diagram) have it at all, and no females (the circles) are ever affected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I show them the labeled version, and there&amp;#39;s a moment of &amp;quot;Hey, wait a  minute…&amp;quot; that ripples through the class. Keep in mind that even the science classes at my university contain typically 60% or more women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/05/weird_ped_labeled.jpeg" width="400" height="205" alt="weird_ped_labeled.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a truly horrible pedigree. Not only is it trying to reduce a very complex trait like &amp;quot;scientific ability&amp;quot; to a discrete character, but its assessment is entirely subjective — a point that is really brought home by pointing out that the pedigree was drawn by Francis Galton, who judged himself brilliant, and that he was evaluating his own family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silent tragedy here, though, is all those women judged as lacking in the characters of brilliance and scientific ability. They are rendered as nullities by the prejudices of the time — even if they had shown the spark of genius, they probably would not have been recognized by Galton — and by a culture that wouldn&amp;#39;t have trained or encouraged girls to do more than master needlework and laundry and household management, and would have brought them up to value the fruitfulness of their ovaries over the product of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at all those empty circles. I'm sure some of them had the capacity to be an entrepreneur like Josiah Wedgwood, or an eclectic philosopher like Erasmus Darwin, or a deep and meticulous scientist like Charles Darwin, or even just a successful doctor like Robert Darwin (II-4; not someone I would have characterized as brilliant, and also an indicator of the variety of abilities Galton was lumping together in his arbitrary judgments). Half the scientific potential in that pedigree was thrown away by restrictive social conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of blind bias we have to end, and I think this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/04/the_letters_to_our_daughters_p.php"&gt;Letters to our Daughters project&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful idea. Stop pretending the circles are empty, and ask them to speak; color in those circles with talent. If you are a female scientist, or you know a female scientist, write in and set an example, and show the next generation of our daughters that they have a history, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/05/the_letters_to_our_daughters_p_1.php"&gt;first letter in the project now&lt;/a&gt;. I think it needs a few thousand more.&lt;/p&gt;

You know already what kind of idiotic tripe he's going to trot out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of the so-called 'swine flu' demonstrates yet again how useless and sometimes deadly a mutation can be. Furthermore, as the infection spreads around the world, the search for an antidote is desperately sought, but the very fact that the virus is seen as something to be opposed actually supports the Biblical view of this world. It is always good and right to oppose sickness, but in evolutionary terms, why don't humans simply resign themselves to it and allow the strong to survive? The evolutionary point of view would say the virus has a 'right' to live, so 'good luck' to it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wrong can he be? It's hard to imagine screwing it up more. In the evolutionary point of view, we are the children of ancestors who fought off disease and lived to procreate; those who surrender to a viruses imaginary right to live, if such imaginary beings ever existed, didn't make much of a contribution to the current gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you might wonder, what will the Ray Comforts of the world do to fight the virus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great hope for this fallen, diseased, weatherworn world, is the return of Christ, who has promised to bring restoration, everlasting health and peace to all people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If waiting for Jesus is his only answer, he can join his fantasy evilutionists in the graveyard. But he&amp;#39;s lying here, because we know what will happen if Comfort feels the stirrings of the flu — he&amp;#39;ll scurry to his nearest doctor to take advantage of the work of scientists who don&amp;#39;t think the only hope is to cry out to Jebus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the contrast: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/scientificactivist/2009/05/why_swine_flu_is_resistant_to.php"&gt;Nick Anthis describes the molecular mechanism of the flu's resistance to some of the drugs in our arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, he doesn&amp;#39;t cite the Bible even once, nor does he beg for mercy from a merciful deity. He does cite the scientific literature, though, and explains the natural, material processes — those mutations — that have contributed to the potency of this strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who contributes more to the health and happiness of the people of this world, scientists or bible-thumpin' idjits?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/a_little_study_in_contrasts.php"&gt;Read the entire post&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/a_little_study_in_contrasts.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post&lt;/a&gt;</content><author><name>PZ Myers</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248278436700"><id gr:original-id="tag:scienceblogs.com,2009:/pharyngula//7.119349">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f12223600843c3da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Christianity Today is full of fools, apparently</title><published>2009-05-01T14:26:33Z</published><updated>2009-05-01T14:32:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/christianity_today_is_full_of.php" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can you bear yet another poll today?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislative session so far has not been kind to the State Board of Education.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Senate confirmation of Board Chairman Don McLeroy, R-College Station, is dead in the water, the Nominations Committee chairman said Thursday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The House of Representatives approved a constitutional amendment Monday that would move the investment decisions about the $17.5 billion Permanent School Fund away from the board to an appointed council of financial professionals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And a bipartisan group of senators has introduced a bill to take away the elected board's authority over curriculum and textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen Meyer is the director of the Discovery Institute’s Center for Science and Culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jerry Coyne from the University of Chicago [is an] evolutionary biologist and thinks it’s inappropriate for someone who believes in God and who further believes that science and God are compatible to be the head of a scientific organization,” he notes. “But the double-standard involved in that condemnation is kind of breathtaking because Coyne is an outspoken atheist – and atheism is every bit as much a worldview as theism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . While Collins has never supported the idea of intelligent design, Meyer contends the idea that he should be disqualified to head an organization such as the NIH because of his religious beliefs amounts to bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalk up another lie to Meyer and the Discovery Institute. For the record, what I said about the matter is &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/francis-collins-as-nih-director/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been chewing over what I think of Obama’s picking Francis Collins as head of the National Institutes of Health. (See the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; piece &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/health/policy/09nih.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which includes some reactions by other scientists.)  I guess my first reaction would be to give the guy a break, and take a wait-and-see attitude towards his stewardship of the NIH.  After all, he doesn’t seem to have let his superstition get in the way of his other administrative tasks, and he doesn’t seem to be the vindictive type, either. (I do have an NIH grant!)  I won’t grouse too much about this, but do want to emphasize again that the guy is deeply, deeply superstitious, to the point where, on his website BioLogos and his book &lt;a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060815_sam_harris_language_ignorance/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he lets his faith contaminate his scientific views.  So I can’t help but be a bit worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/05/27/collins-may-be-nih-director/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins may indeed be a good administrator, but this appointment is a mistake.  At the very least, Collins must remove himself as director of the BioLogos foundation, as holding both posts would represent an unwanted incursion of religion into the public sphere.  I call for him to resign from BioLogos if he’s appointed as head of the NIH. (That, of course, has the attendant benefit of putting the ever-amusing Karl Giberson in charge of BioLogos!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I think the appointment was mistaken, but I do understand why Obama did it. And I certainly don’t think Collins should have been disqualified because of his faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CANCER INFO.UPDATES…..very important and informative!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, my husband recently &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6530"&gt;completed a series of treatments&lt;/a&gt; for thyroid cancer. In addition, my sister had a cervical cancer scare last year and my best friend from college has had two rounds of treatment from two different types of cancer in the past couple of years. Plus, my former boss and good friend has been fighting leukemia for about 4 years now. Cancer is sort of a hot button issue for me at the moment, if you can believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email began:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLEASE BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO PASS THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO OTHERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFTER YEARS OF TELLING PEOPLE CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRY (TRY THE KEYWORD) AND ELIMINATE CANCER, JOHNS HOPKINS IS FINALLY STARTING TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh oh. Warning bells started to go off immediately. A quick trip to Snopes and I discovered that this email is, if you can believe it, &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/medical/disease/cancerupdate.asp"&gt;a piece of crap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.icanhascheezburger.com/completestore/2008/11/29/128724578550882784.jpg" alt="" width="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably should have let it go at that point. But I read on, because I noticed that this particular piece of spam uses some common techniques to promote bad, bad things. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to go through these techniques to demonstrate the particularly insidious nature of this piece of pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technique #1: Claim authority.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email makes multiple references to Johns Hopkins. By referencing a facility which is well known for new advancements in medical treatments, it fakes credibility.  Interestingly, this particular email has apparently been around for a while. Long enough for Johns Hopkins to provide a detailed &lt;a href="http://www.hopkinskimmelcancercenter.org/index.cfm/cID/1684/mpage/item.cfm/itemID/1016"&gt;response and alert&lt;/a&gt; that the information is not from them and why it’s wrong. For that reason, I’m not going to go into the details of why the content here is wrong – they’ve done a fine job of that. I’m more interested in how the spammer gets your attention. And that’s with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technique #2: Ensure your audience will keep reading by making it relevant to them, immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every person has cancer cells in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person’s life time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Johns Hopkins site, it’s true in that among the trillions of cells in the human body, inevitably everyone has some abnormal or atypical cells that possess some of the characteristics of cancer cells. However, most resolve themselves and never result in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;strong&gt;Technique # 3: Drop in a few pieces of truth into the mix, for credibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, all that sounds reasonable, no? Or at least like stuff you’ve heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your target is primed for &lt;strong&gt;Technique #4: Lie, lie, and lie some more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the person’s immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle (lack of sleep) factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During your lies, be sure to include plenty of &lt;strong&gt;Technique #5: Fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy … destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinaltract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that you’ve got your subject quivering with fear, let’s get to &lt;strong&gt;Technique # 6: Crazy-ass recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; (not really a technique, more the whole point of the spam, I guess):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the article goes on to talk about the foods and processes that cancer cells feed on and that you should therefore avoid. The list includes but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugar substitutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red meat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooked food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caffeine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distilled water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meat (I know I said that already. They say it 3 times)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plastic containers or wrap in the microwave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water bottles in the freezer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It suggests nutritional and life changes including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A diet consisting of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh vegetable juice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green tea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A host of nutritional supplements to “enable the body’s own killer cells to destroy cancer cells.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxygen therapy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got all that? Now, by this point, one can assume that the email reader is subsisting on a diet of vitamins, sticks and dirt while cooking sprouts on a small fire in the backyard and trying to focus while breathing deeply and purifying their own water. So the email offers some final advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit.. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor. Anger, unforgiveness and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck with that. Oh, and one last thing. &lt;strong&gt;Technique #7: Make sure you make someone else’s life miserable too.&lt;/strong&gt; Or you’re a bad person who hates everyone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(PLEASE FORWARD IT TO PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an article that should be sent to anyone important in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I’ve gone on for way too long about this and most of you smart, skeptical readers probably wouldn’t have even gotten past the first paragraph of this email before deleting it. But it’s important to remember that not everyone has our skeptical glasses and it’s important that every time, EVERY TIME you get one of these, you do take the time to research it and send back a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will we stop the spam from flowing? Probably not. And will this email *really* turn a lot of people to an all-vegetable diet in lieu of traditional cancer treatments? Probably not. But there are two reasons to always respond to these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you point out the crazy, it may help someone look at the next piece of crazy with a little more skepticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This email, like many others, has a particularly anti-science message. Chemotherapy is a scary enough prospect as it is. If this email causes even one person to try to use nutritional supplements instead of chemotherapy, it’s too much damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer and cancer treatment is scary. But it works. All the people I mentioned at the beginning of this email are alive today because of traditional cancer treatment. We cannot let even these small attacks on traditional medicine go by unchallenged. There’s simply too much at stake.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248277308776"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7201/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cdce90832364bf85</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">U.S. Withheld Data on Risks of Distracted Driving</title><published>2009-07-22T15:51:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T15:51:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7201/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2003, researchers at a federal agency proposed a long-term study of 10,000 drivers to assess the safety risk posed by cellphone use behind the wheel.

Before the 7th week of gestation her right hemisphere stopped developing. This fact was not discovered, however, until she was about three year old, because she is remarkably neurologically intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is being reported by the media as surprising, but it is strikingly not so. It is certainly interesting, and the details of the rewiring of her brain are of interest, but I am decidedly not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar cases have been reported previously and we have a pretty good understanding of how and why this happens. If one part, even half, of the brain is damaged or fails to develop at an early embryological stage the brain still retains the ability to wire itself around the missing or damaged cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is due to the fact that brain development does not result from following a genetic blueprint. The brain is not built by following a plan the way a house is built from a bluprint. Rather, the genes determine the rules of development like an algorithm which then unfolds dynamically to create the brain. This process is called mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping allows for the brain to encode more information than the genes that code for building the brain. As the brain develops it maps itself to the body and to use. This way the genes do not have to tell how to wire up each retinal cell to its corresponding neuron in the visual cortex – they just encode for the process by which the visual cortex maps to visual input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier in the brain development process a piece of the brain is damaged or lost, the greater the capacity for the development process to remap and recover the otherwise lost function. This is a property of the brain known as plasticity, which we retain through adulthood but is maximal during embryological development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are cases, for example, of children born with one hemisphere missing but they are not paralyzed on the opposite side of the body – the side controlled by the missing half of the brain. This is because the surviving hemisphere picks up control of that side of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also why there are cases of surgical removal of one hemisphere. Some children have a damaged hemisphere that is not functional. Whatever function they have is already moved over to the other hemisphere. Sometimes all the damaged hemisphere is doing is serving as a focus for seizures, so removing it will reduce or cure the seizures without causing any loss of function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new case is interesting because the researchers were able to determine how the child’s visual pathways remapped themselves to the surviving hemisphere. She was also born without a right eye, so we are talking only about the mapping of the left eye. Normally the medial part of the retina – the part closer to the nose – which sees left part of the world will map to the right hemisphere, while the temporal retina which sees the right half of the world maps to the left hemisphere (always opposite). In this case both halves of the retina follow different paths to different parts of the visual cortex in the left hemisphere. Therefore she can see both halves of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the reporting suggests that her vision, and even her neurological function, is “normal” or “full”.  While it is remarkably preserved, this is overstating it. She would still lack binocular vision, having only one eye. Also, she is weak on the left side, although she still has function. Also it is likely that her overall intelligence will be below average. She is making do without half a cortex, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases like this are dramatic examples of the consequences of brain mapping and plasticity. These principles are already well established, however, and so there is nothing shocking or suprising about them any more. I was certainly surprised when I first heard of such cases in medical school – they are dramatic – but that was back in the early 90’s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248275185811"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=15351">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/623aeed947a491cf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Baseball"/><category term="Buster Olney"/><category term="Q&amp;A"/><title type="html">Buster Olney Answers Your Baseball Questions</title><published>2009-07-22T15:05:49Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T15:05:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/T5Cspgvrvco/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/buster-olney-answers-your-baseball-questions/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Last week we &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/bring-your-questions-for-baseball-sage-buster-olney/"&gt;solicited your questions&lt;/a&gt; for ESPN baseball reporter and analyst &lt;strong&gt;Buster Olney&lt;/strong&gt;.

But over on YouTube a blogger using the moniker, “Drcraigvideos,” has posted a gem of a study in the theistic ethics of truth-telling---see &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM0KcIt_pXw"&gt;Craig Attack video &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is hard to count the number of untruths in this video, but the story gets even stranger when I confronted the website about these untruths.  Since the website would not post my comments there, I decided to bring their unscrupulous tactics to light here.  It is a study in how self-described professional evangelical apologists, such as Dr. Craig, use character assassination with little regard for basic fact-checking or fairness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I will highlight the issues and comments (numbered for convenience and in general order of appearance in the video along with related e-mails and posted comments on that YouTube blogsite) in bold italics and my responses immediately beneath.  If you watch the video, you will recognize these quoted statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;1.  [Title of post]: “Attacking William Lane Craig.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; This title alone provides a study in deception. In truth, most of the 10+ minutes of this video are attacks on me. In fact, I did not hear a single quote from me in which I made any comments about Dr. Craig, and so it is difficult to see how this is a video about attacks on William Lane Craig. The video should have been titled: “Attacking Dr. Hector Avalos.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The only supposed attacks on Dr. Craig came from a so-called heckler in the audience at the 2004 debate between Dr. Craig and myself at Iowa State University. But this so-called heckler was generally correct in his criticisms of Dr. Craig’s debating tactics.  He did not “heckle” as much as he enumerated specific types of fallacies on the part of Dr. Craig.  Dr. Craig said he did not mind calling me out on my supposed bad tactics, and so why does he not refer to that as “heckling”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;2. [Craig]: “As head of the religious studies department there..."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is patently false. I am not, and have never been, the head of  the religious studies department at Iowa State University or anywhere else. Now, I can forgive a simple error, but Craig attempts to use this leadership position to make it seem as though I exert some malicious undue influence on students. Moreover, even if it is a simple error, what does this say about the respect that Dr. Craig has for basic fact-checking?  My academic history can be googled easily, but he apparently did not bother to do even that. And just for the record, the formal name of my department is the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3. [Craig]: “And he [Avalos] portrays himself as an ex-evangelical and a former preacher. This is all a little bit really exaggerated frankly, when you look into his personal biography. But that’s the way he likes to cast himself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; I either am or am not an ex-evangelical. I either am or am not a former preacher. So how is this exaggerated at all? Otherwise, Dr. Craig does not tell us what was exaggerated. And what does it mean to look into my personal biography? I don't recall Dr. Craig being present in any portion of that period in my life.  So, Craig just throws this charge out there with no other facts to support it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;4. [Craig]: “And has it as his goal to basically destroy the orthodox faith of the Christian students in his classes through intimidation, and ridicule, and criticism.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; There is no basis given for this charge that I use intimidation, ridicule or criticism in my classes for the purpose he claims. Dr. Craig has never been in my classes, and so he cannot have verified this himself. If he is relying on testimony, then it is hearsay.  So how is using hearsay to bring such a generalized charge an ethical or professional thing to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The truth is that the way I teach my classes is very different from the way I speak on these issues outside of classes. In class, I use a multiple viewpoint approach that has been very successful. Outside of class, I argue for my viewpoint as strongly as my constitutional right allows. And here are just a few more facts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. I was named Professor of the Year at ISU in 1996, a university-wide award, that in my case, was initiated by Christian students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. While no professor will often get 100% approval from students, and while I cannot claim everyone feels the same way, student evaluations usually give me some of the highest, and sometimes the highest scores, in my department.  Regularly, 70-80% of mostly Christian students give me the highest possible rating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On a few occasions, 100% of my students gave me the highest ratings possible. This is hard to do if I am as Dr. Craig describes. And those who do describe me as intimidating mostly do so for my academically demanding manner rather than for any effort to destroy faith in class. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Of course, Dr. Craig has never seen these student evaluations, and so it is difficult to see how he can have so little regard for basic fairness before making such a charge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. While I don’t recommend looking at Rate My Professor because the sample is so small and the student status of those posting entries is hard to verify, the ratings and comments there generally reflect the scores I receive.&lt;br&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=469479"&gt;Rate my Professor &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D. No one has ever brought any formal complaint about my teaching in my 16 years at Iowa State University. I’ve had probably over 2000 students, most of them Christians.  So, how is going 100% of the time without a formal complaint in 16 years of teaching make Dr. Craig’s case? And even if he found such students, their complaint would have to be investigated more thoroughly before regarding it as “fact.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;5. [Craig]: “The way he behaves in these debates also can be very unprofessional, appealing to ad hominem attacks...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; This seems to be at variance with his quoted comments in the Iowa State Daily (February 6, 2004) after our debate: “Craig said he enjoyed the dialogue with Avalos very much and he thought there was no ill will between them.&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;‘Both Avalos and I conducted ourselves with the proper tone and behavior,’ Craig said.”&lt;/span&gt; (emphasis mine)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.iowastatedaily.com/articles/2004/02/06/hot_topics/20040206-archive.txt"&gt;What Craig said then&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;So was Dr. Craig telling the truth then, or was he misquoted?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;6. [Craig]: “I felt very uncomfortable about doing that because it was in a sense attacking him  in the debate for his methods, for his modus operandi, but I thought that I had to do it since I was the first speaker and I didn’t want him to pull one of these tricks on me...the way I had seen him do with a professor Shelly in a previous debate...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; When referring to his opening remarks at our 2004 debate, Dr. Craig seems to admit to attacking me, but this YouTube video suggests that it is I who is attacking Dr. Craig. So much for truth in advertising. I also explained why I had to do what I did with Dr. Shelly, and so does that justify what I did?  See &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/01/dr-hector-avalos-comments-on-his-debate.html"&gt;My comments on Craig Debate &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And why does Dr. Craig keep complaining about a debate that many of his supporters claim he won? It seems you don’t keep complaining about a debate you so obviously won. Why does Dr. Craig keep explaining why he deviated from a normal debate protocol (in his opening statement) if he wants to make the case that his opponent was not following proper protocol?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;7. [Craig]: “[Avalos]... Continued since then to attack me on a personal level...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; I certainly have not posted any attack videos about Dr. Craig on YouTube, and my comments about Dr. Craig have at least appealed to  his own words for my conclusions. I have not used hearsay from unnamed sources.  See: &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/01/dr-hector-avalos-comments-on-his-debate.html"&gt;My comments on Craig Debate &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My critique of his flawed and inconsistent views on the resurrection in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The End of Biblical Studies&lt;/span&gt; is scholarly, not personal. Therein I discuss in detail how he blatantly misrepresents the work of the historian, C. Behan McCullagh.  When I discuss Dr. Craig's questionable claims that errors in one of his books were due to the printer, I at least showed a document from his publisher that denies that was the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;8. [Craig]: “Gonzalez’s colleagues in the department, despite this secret e-mail campaign, publicly said this is simply about his academic credentials, not intelligent design, when, in fact, secretly that was clearly the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr. Craig’s comments here shift to the creationist movie &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/span&gt; (2008). The movie featured the case of Guillermo Gonzalez, a professor at Iowa State who was denied tenure in 2007. Dr. Gonzalez is an advocate of Intelligent Design creationism. The  movie tried to make much of some supposed secret conspiracy against Gonzalez, and claims that some e-mails provide a smoking gun. I have already commented on why this is not the case: &lt;a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/DISmokingGun.cfm"&gt;The Gonzalez E-mails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Craig, who is not part of Iowa State University and who was not privy to any internal discussions, is generally repeating the propaganda of the Discovery Institute, the main pro-Intelligent Design organization today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;9. [Craig]: “But Avalos, I suppose not being part of that department—he was very overt that this was about Intelligent Design and said as much in the interview.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another deceptive statement because it leads the listener to assume that I was speaking about the tenure of Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez (see below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;10. [Drcraigvideos slide:]“And here’s proof of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;br&gt; Wrong again. This is only proof that the person posting at &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Drcraigvideos&lt;/span&gt; has fallen for some deceptive editing in the movie Expelled. This individual was not at that interview, and so could not possibly hear what was being discussed right before the sentence in the clip. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And for more on the deceptive interview techniques of the producers of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Expelled&lt;/span&gt;--See: &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/index.php/background/interview-tactics"&gt;Expelled’s Deceptions &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Drcraigvideo&lt;/span&gt;s will blog about those deceptive tactics anytime soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;11. [Dr. Avalos]: “What we wanted to stop is the use of the name of ISU to validate Intelligent Design...and we did succeed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is the actual quote from me heard in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Expelled&lt;/span&gt;. Despite the plain meaning of my statement, notice how Dr. Craig is leading listeners to assume that I was speaking about the denial of tenure for Dr. Gonzalez. Again, what I meant is further explained here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/DISmokingGun.cfm"&gt;The Gonzalez E-mails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After listening to this video, I contacted the webmaster to correct some of the inaccuracies in the video. Here follows the e-mail responses I received from “&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Drcraigvideos&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;12. [Saturday, July 18, 2009]&lt;br&gt;"Dr. Craig videos has replied to your comment on 'Attacking William Lane Craig.'&lt;br&gt;Havalos50010: 'As usual' Dr. Craig is not dealing with the facts? You mean to tell me he was lying when you vindicated his claim that it was because of Gonzalez's view on ID that got him denied tenure? BTW, you were given tenure and promoted full professorship at ISU at the department of "Religious Studies" so who are you kidding? Craig may not have been in your classes but certainly students have told him how you tried to de-convert them Christianity. Professionals don't do that, Dr. Avalos."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; See above for this supposed “vindication.” Observe that, instead of correcting the false information in Dr. Craig’s comments, the webmaster attempts to justify Craig's use of  hearsay to level accusations.  Note that this individual assumes the truth of Dr. Craig’s statements without checking the veracity of the claims that Dr. Craig makes. Do professionals do that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And this person issues a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;non sequitur&lt;/span&gt; when linking my promotion to Dr. Gonzalez’s situation.  But how does my promotion mean anything about the merits of Dr. Gonzalez’s case, especially since we are in different departments? Indeed, even William Dembski, the main guru of Intelligent Design, said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Dembski’s comments &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comment 48:&lt;br&gt;To Hector Avalos: Thank you for your forthright response and for answering my questions. You certainly seem worthy of tenure, and I expect I would have voted for your tenure had I been on any of the appropriate committees. (Would you do the same for Guillermo Gonzalez?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;13. [Saturday, July 18, 2009]&lt;br&gt; "drcraigvideos has sent you a message:&lt;br&gt;Comment&lt;br&gt;I deleted the comment because I can't confirm if you're actually Hector Avalos. However, by stating "as usual" Dr. Craig isn't using facts, I can't allow that type of insult to Dr. Craig. If this is Dr. Avalos, why not go ahead and post your review of this video at the "Debunking Christianity" blogsite? God bless."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Now this becomes bizarrely humorous. The webmaster refuses to post my corrections and complaints because I have insulted Dr. Craig by stating “as usual” even though I can support a long list of claims that Dr. Craig has called facts but are not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Second, notice that the ethics of this theist “can’t allow this kind of insult” but it can allow hearsay, calling someone a liar and a “weasel” without any sort of solid documentation, and without the courtesy of checking with the accused to see if there is some other explanation or response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Notice that the reason given for deleting my comment is because the webmaster says that he (or she) cannot confirm my identity. Apparently, however, the webmaster does not mind that he or she cannot confirm the identity of anyone Dr. Craig has used for his hearsay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In addition, the webmaster does not seem to be able to look up my office phone number to leave a message in order to request confirmation of my identity. Can this person really not think of any other way to confirm my identity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And if the e-mail messages I received were not associated with &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Drcraigvideo&lt;/span&gt;s, then I do apologize. That is part of my professional ethic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;14. [Comment from IDQuest]: “He [Avalos] does not understand Intelligent Design (after all, he's not a scientist)....”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; I’ve answered this old charge, but IDQuest can’t seem to use Google very well, and this individual does not specify how  this conclusion was reached. See further--&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/avalos_responds.php"&gt;My response to Discovery Institute smear campaign &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;15. [Comment from IDQuest]: “and he has no real warrant when it comes to history. If anybody is interested I have a debate between Avalos and Weikart on the Nazis and whether they were evolutionists or not (do a search of "Were the Nazis Evolutionists?" in youtube). Avalos gets roasted in the debate!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; I am sure IDQuest must be a qualified historian or else this individual exempts himself (or herself) from a standard demanded of others. My publishing record shows that I am as much of an historian as many other biblical scholars (and certainly as compared with Dr. Craig). I also have pointed out Dr. Weikart’s numerous historical errors (including clearly misrepresenting Darwin in one passage, ignoring a long history of Christian anti-Judaism, being unable to find a single direct quote of Darwin on the part of  Hitler, and using questionable  sources such as Hitler’s &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Table Talk&lt;/span&gt; for his evidence).   See further:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Avalos contra Weikart:Part I &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/avalos-contra-weikart-part-ii-weikarts.html"&gt;Avalos contra Weikart: Part II &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, let IDQuest specify where I get “roasted.” We need specifics, not generalized charges from IDQuest, who, I suppose, is an eminent historian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Unfortunately, character assassination has always been a standard operating procedure among theistic apologists. We need to call them on it when it becomes as egregious as this example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If they are even going to begin to succeed in showing moral superiority, theists first have to convince atheists that they actually are practicing better ethics or at least the ethics they preach.  What we find here is that the use of hearsay and generalized character assassination is valid if it suits your ends. The ends justifies the means. There is no need to verify if accusations are true or not, but don’t use the phrase, “as usual,” or that becomes grounds for not posting a correction to false statements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So here is a good test of theistic ethics for Dr. Craig or his minions at &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;drcraigvideos&lt;/span&gt;. I will restrict it to the simplest facts that can be expected on the grounds of simple fairness:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Will Dr. Craig or the aforementioned webmaster admit at least that it is false to claim that I am or ever was the head of the Religious Studies department at Iowa State University? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Will Dr. Craig and/or the aforementioned webmaster tells us how they verified truth of any defamatory hearsay that was repeated about my teaching methods in class? In particular, can they give us percentages of dissatisfied students or the percentage of students that make such claims compared to the percentages of students that provide the highest ratings? Can they provide specific names so that we can check their student status and verify the complaints? Otherwise, they might be wise to consult a good lawyer about what defamation of character means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Does Dr. Craig regard using hearsay, character assassination, and misrepresenting my comments in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Expelled&lt;/span&gt; as “professional” and ethical conduct? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCLAIMERS:&lt;br&gt;-I am transcribing the video as best I could. If there are errors, I will be glad to correct them.&lt;br&gt;-I don't necessarily assume that Dr. Craig is sponsoring &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Drcraigvideos&lt;/span&gt;, but he should dissasociate himself explicitly if he does not approve of their unscrupulous practices. His statements on the clip, however, are&lt;br&gt;his responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8459792158948080865?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Everyone knows that the MHC is in the MHC, right? Well, it’s not necessarily so.
That’s not as tautological as it sounds.  MHC (major histocompatibility complex) can refer to either the protein complex, or to the genomic region.  In most species the genes encoding MHC proteins are clustered together into a distinct region [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I like Whoopi Goldberg, in general. She was awesome as Guinan (a character that was severely misutilized on TNG), and funny in a lot of movies. But &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAlqQmiDesE"&gt;in this clip on The View&lt;/a&gt;, she’s questioning the Apollo Moon landings. I know she’s being funny, but she also sounds a little serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/IAlqQmiDesE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions Whoopi asks aren’t hard to answer. No one took the footage of Armstrong’s first step (it was a camera he deployed before stepping off the ladder), and there was a video camera on the rover that shot the footage of the ascent module taking off (remotely controlled on Earth by &lt;a href="http://www.clavius.org/bibmilne.html"&gt;Ed Fendell&lt;/a&gt;). The flag waves because the astronauts were struggling to get the pole in the lunar surface (let a belt hang from your hand at arm’s length and move your arm back and forth; watch the belt ripple despite the fact it can’t be the air making it move). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etc., and so on, &lt;em&gt;und so weiter&lt;/em&gt;, ad infinitum. &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html"&gt;Someone should point her here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I have the usual sort of debunking in it, but I made a point I had not seen anywhere else at that time: why don’t astronomers see relatively more UFOs than laypeople?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. Astronomers, both amateur and professional, are constantly viewing the sky. There are tens of thousands of amateurs out observing all the time: a large sample population, and far larger in observing man-hours than the regular population. If UFOs are so common, then why do we not see an unusually large number of reports from astronomers?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My assertion is that this is because the vast majority of UFO reports from people are misidentified objects like Venus, the Moon, satellites, balloons, and so on. These are things every amateur astronomer has seen countless times, and knows are not alien spaceships bent on probing the backsides of rural citizens. While this does not mean every single observed object is something more mundane, it does mean that the huge numbers quoted by UFOlogists are most certainly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I published the book, I got lots of criticism from the UFO culture who, predictably, couldn’t parse my very simple logic. I got some amusement from it, I’ll admit, since trying to reason with some people is clearly a losing game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bring all this up now? Because amateur astronomer Tim Printy has published an article about this in his online magazine &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty/UFO/SUNlite.htm"&gt;Skeptical UFO Newsletter lite (SUNlite)&lt;/a&gt; — you can download the issue directly &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty/UFO/SUNlite1_2.pdf"&gt;here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. He does an excellent job rebutting the usual silly claims of the UFO crowd when they froth and rail about my statement. He picks their arguments apart point-by-point, showing just why my claims are accurate and theirs are not. It’s a good read… and I’m not saying that because he supports me. I’m saying that &lt;em&gt;because he’s right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers may remember Tim’s &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty/UFO/AZUFO.htm"&gt;excellent debunking of the Phoenix Lights&lt;/a&gt; as well, which &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/23/phoenix-lights-again/"&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; on the tenth anniversary of that particular silliness. I think I’ll keep my eye on him. Another skeptical astronomer is most welcome! &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248266832506"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=568">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c925d9458c2e6ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience/Mental Health"/><title type="html">Minimally Conscious vs Persistent Vegetative State</title><published>2009-07-22T12:00:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T12:00:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=568" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A new study suggests that it may not be uncommon for patients who are in a minimally conscious state to be misdiagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. The study underscores the necessity of using standardized and objective diagnostic criteria in diagnosing coma. However, it also leaves some important questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As background it is essential to understand a bit about consciousness and coma, for not all comas are created equally. In order to be conscious a person requires at least one hemisphere of the brain be mostly functioning and they require a functioning brainstem. The cortical hemispheres contain the gray matter – that part of the brain that thinks. So it makes sense that a certain minimal amount of gray matter is necessary to generate consciousness. As gray matter is damaged or inhibited from functioning one’s level of consciousness decreases until it descends beyond that fuzzy boundary into unconsciousness. When such unconsciousness is persistent we call that coma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But interestingly the cortex by itself cannot generate consciousness. It requires constant prodding by a diffuse region in the brainstem (that primitive part at the base of the brain that connects the brain and the spinal cord) called the brainstem activating system. This region sends a constant barrage of electrical signals through the thalamus (the relay center of the brain) and then onto the cortex. Without this constant stimulation the cortex will lapse into sleep and coma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, therefore, that someone’s cortex, with all of their memories and personality, can be intact but they are permanently asleep because their brainstem is damaged. This is a very different kind of coma than that which results from diffuse cortical damage – although the end result may be very similar and of no consequence to the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore when considering coma, generally or in an individual, the exact type and severity of coma needs to be carefully defined before any meaningful statements or predictions can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A minimally conscious state (MCS) is one in which a person has severe brain damage and is only able to produce subtle and intermittent signs of consciousness. This needs to be distinguished from a persistent vegetative state (PV), in which there are, by definition, no signs of consciousness. Although in a PV state patients may exhibit many automatic behaviors, like opening and closing the eyes, wandering gaze, and facial movements, that can be mistaken for conscious behavior. PV states carry a grim prognosis with a small chance of any meaningful recovery that diminishes further over time. Very rarely a patient in a PV state may improve into a MCS. A MCS also has a poor prognosis, but it is better than a PV state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to prognosis there are implications for management. Patients in a MCS may be able to perceive, if dimly, contact with their loved ones. They may also experience pain and therefore require pain medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004 Giacino et al &lt;a href="http://www.tbims.org/combi/crs/CRS%20Syllabus.pdf"&gt;published the CRS-R&lt;/a&gt; – Coma Recovery Scale – Revised, which outlines a standardized procedure for diagnosing MCS. The procedure is fairly elaborate  – it looks for the signs of consciousness that are in the definition of MCS, and requires that any findings are reproducible. One putative advantage also is that it takes into account that a patient in a MCS may have intermittent consciousness, and therefore repeated testing after attempting to arouse the patient is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Giacino and colleagues have &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2377-9-35.pdf"&gt;published a study&lt;/a&gt; where they compare the CRS-R to a so-called clinical consensus diagnosis – where physicians, nurses, physical therapists, etc. base their diagnosis on the standard neurological exam for coma.  What they found is that of 44 patients with a consensus diagnosis of PVS, 18 (41%) met criteria for MCS according to the more elaborate CRS-R exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure, 41%, is consistent with prior studies that show many patients with a diagnosis of PVS have signs of minimal consciousness if they are examined more thoroughly. While it is disappointing that the misdiagnosis rate remains so high, such results are not surprising. The diagnosis of PVS is partially based on the demonstration of a negative – the lack of any sign of even subtle and transient consciousness. Demonstrating a negative is always only as reliable as the thoroughness of the search, and it is not surprising that a more thorough search is therefore finding more patients with subtle signs of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one quibble with the way the study is currently presented (it is not yet in its final form) is that we are not told how many of the patients were diagnosed by neurologists vs intensive care medical doctors or physiatrists. I admit my bias as a neurologist that neurologists tend to do more thorough neurological exams. Perhaps this factor did not matter, but the information is not currently available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, while the study informs us that 10% of the patients diagnosed with MCS by consensus criteria emerged from MCS during the study, we are not given any comparison between patients diagnosed with PVS and those diagnosed with MCS by the CRS-R criteria. If, as is likely, the CRS-R is finding the most subtle cases of MCS – those closest to being in a PVS, it would be very interesting to learn if there was any difference in the clinical outcome of these two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison being made is not to a highly reliable gold standard, but between two methods of clinical assessment, one more sensitive than the other (by definition, since it found more cases of MCS). However, is the CRS-R as specific, or is it finding false positives. Even if it is not finding false positives, what is the difference in clinical outcome between those in a PVS and those barely in a MCS? I am not arguing that there is no difference – just that the study as currently published does not give that information. I suspect that if there were a significant difference they would have reported it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technology advances the distinction in these forms of clinical diagnosis may make more, and less, difference. Less in that other forms of diagnosis may become available, such as using functional MRI scanning to assess cortical activity. Even now the clinical exam must be put into the context of brain imaging. But advances in fMRI and similar technology may free us from having to infer brain activity from examination alone, which has limits even when highly standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the distinction between PVS and MCS may become more meaningful as treatments for MCS advance. Already there are &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18322474?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=3&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of using deep brain stimulation to increase the level of arousal in patients in a MCS. This is still a crude intervention, but has lead to meaningful clinical improvements. As brain-computer chip interfaces improve we will likely see the day when neural prosthetics could boost brain function sufficiently to wake the comatose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

In the final analysis I think this study makes a reasonable case for using more elaborate and standardized diagnostic procedures to more reliably diagnose PVS vs MCS. More evidence is needed, however, to assess the clinical relevance of this distinction.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;(I got the idea for this post&lt;/i&gt; before &lt;i&gt;reading &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/music_interests_and_questions_coast_to_coast"&gt;this one from yesterday&lt;/a&gt; by Dora, for reals. Hope it is complementary.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've thought a lot about music in seeking to understand my son's communication, both verbal and non-verbal. Charlie has been attentive to music from when he was an infant and Jim whistled "We love you Charlie" (based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Love_You_Beatles"&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;) and "Charlie boy" (based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Boy"&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;) and I played the piano with a far smaller boy on my lap. He could sing complete phrases of songs when he was 4 or so (it's very rare that Charlie produces a phrase of more than three words on his own). He can read music on the piano and cello at a fairly basic level, but that's reading that has come more readily to Charlie than reading words. He seems to listen for pitch and tone and tune in what people say, as much as to individual words. Sometimes it's the tune Charlie sings that tells us how he is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this music education program makes a lot of sense: It's "designed to help children with ASD better understand emotions and learn to recognize emotions in others" as noted in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090720220414.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;.  Istvan Molnar-Szakacs, a researcher at the UCLA Tennenbaum Center for the Biology of Creativity and member of the of the Help Group–UCLA Autism Research Alliance, is developing what is to be a 12-week program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the children are using a method of music education known as the &lt;a href="http://www.aosa.org/"&gt;Orff-Schulwerk approach&lt;/a&gt;. Developed by 20th-century German composer Carl Orff ("schulwerk" is German for schooling), it is a unique approach to music learning that is supported by movement and based on things that kids intuitively like to do, such as sing, chant rhymes, clap, dance and keep a beat or play a rhythm on anything near at hand. Orff called this music and movement activity "elemental" — basic, unsophisticated and concerned with the fundamental building blocks of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12-week program uses elements from the Orff method — including games, instruments and teamwork — and combines them with musical games. The idea is to pair emotional musical excerpts with matching displays of social emotion (happy with happy, sad with sad, etc.) in a social, interactive setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Music is a birthright of all children. To be able to listen and appreciate, sing or participate in music-making are as essential to development as mathematical or linguistic learning," Molnar-Szakacs said. "The purpose of this work is to provide a means for awakening the potential in every child for being 'musical' — that is, to be able to understand and use music and movement as forms of expression and, through that, to develop a recognition and understanding of emotions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, Charlie, through no specific teaching on Jim's or my or anyone's part (save for his former, much-missed &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/innovative-piano-a-tale-of-two-music-books/"&gt;piano teacher&lt;/a&gt;) indeed is "able to understand and use music and movement as forms of expression." I'd even say that he has developed "recognition and understanding of emotions"  though since Charlie's verbal language is limited, I can't be sure of that. Nonetheless, it's precisely because his language is limited that Charlie seems to rely on music both to express something emotional and to pick up on the emotions of others. And certainly combining music with movement (moving a finger to push down a piano key or pluck a string) has something, perhaps, to do with why Charlie has been able to read musical notes after relatively little instruction, whereas reading words has seemed an activity very challenging for him to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, due to his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_playlist_for_the_sound-sensitive"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, we've had to take a hiatus from the music instrument playing. For most of his life, Charlie has enjoyed listening to CDs in the car and long ago appropriated the CD case to play the DJ (unfortunately resulting in many CDs being smeared and smudged beyond playabiity). For the past several months, he has been saying no to the music and car rides have been quiet but he recently has been interested again. His latest favorite is a "Soulsville USA" CD and, I kid you not, the biggest smile appears when the song "Starting All Over Again" comes on----almost too appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just another way that music often does the talking.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248260520765"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13811">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5558f9ceda6c8e43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Books"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: Hard to Throw Away Books, Even Gawdawful Ones</title><published>2009-07-22T11:00:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T11:00:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/22/ask-richard-hard-to-throw-away-books-even-gawdawful-ones/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Richard,    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book related question!  Yay!    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love books.  I’m almost at the level of Thomas Jefferson in that regard. I can’t deny myself a book.  Today, I broke my prohibition on going into bookstores and walked out with an arm load. While I can imagine having books stacked floor to ceiling, my wife likes them on bookshelves. There just aren’t enough shelves or enough room to add more.  I think I need to start getting rid of some old books. Herein lies the problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I was nominally a Christian. At least I was told I was and given books to reinforce that. I had many religious themed books, many passed down from my parents and cousins. They should be the first to go. I’d like to someday have children, but I can’t have them exposed to that filth before they’re old enough to think for themselves.  I can’t throw them away.  They’re books.  How can you throw away a book?  It might have something useful to say regardless of the subject matter. That alone is a reason it is hard to part with them, even though I’ve never read many of them. But, alas, they must go.  I can’t bring myself to donate them to a library or charity or sell them to a used book store because children might read them.  I don’t want to be responsible for poisoning a mind. Do you have any suggestion of a way I can get rid of these books in a way that won’t ruin young minds? I also don’t want to destroy data. I’m sure they’re not the last copies, but each one destroyed brings us one step closer to losing something that might be important.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–  New Thomas Jefferson sans shelves
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Thomas, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand your dilemma. I adore books.  I covet and clutch them like the Gollum with his “Precious.”  My parents raised me to love and revere books, and their home was filled with them, as my home is now.  I was encouraged to read any book I found, provided that I always washed my hands first, and I that I practiced the proper method of turning the pages, to make sure they did not tear or wrinkle.  Books were precious things.  So, throwing away old, obsolete books was for a long time impossible for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I became a man, I put away childish things. (I’m not making fun of you, just myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hundreds and hundreds of books in my home, many of which I had not read in decades, and many of which I never would read at all.  They were handicapping my life with clutter. My keeping so many of them was a little about clinging to nostalgia or sentiment, but mostly  to my misplaced veneration for all books no matter what, even those that had become junk, useless at best and misleading at worst.  So one day, I gathered up several old science books, (especially precious to me) that had become obsolete, incomplete, and just plain wrong.  I first considered donating them to the local library’s used book sale, but for reasons similar to those you have mentioned about your old religious books, I didn’t want them confusing and misleading kids with their incorrect content.  Some well-meaning thrifty parents would pick them up for fifty cents each, and not knowing any better,  would give their kids outdated science books, setting them back a step instead of helping them forward.  So I carried them to the paper recycle bin, took a deep breath, bit my lip, forgave myself, and…… DUMPED THEM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liberation!&lt;/em&gt;  The moment I did it I felt so much better, like having a great big and long overdue crap.  I went through my morbidly obese home library and I kept the classics, the valuable collector’s items, the still-current reference books and a couple of childhood memory indulgences. I gave the novels I’d finished to friends, donated appropriate ones that I would not need again to the library book sale, and having some empty space on my shelves, realized that those books I had kept were smiling back at me with their genuine value.  My collection was more of a treasure, not less, because they were selected and kept for the value of their content, instead of stored mindlessly simply because they were books.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas, If you find those old children’s religious books to be so vile that you shudder at the prospect of children finding and reading them, then let them be “born again” as paper bags and ceiling insulation.  Save some trees.  Unless you can find some kind of museum or institution that is dedicated to the scholarly study of religious schlock where they can be safely locked up, then help kids be safer by eliminating hazards like unexploded ordnance, bottles of caustic chemicals and to use your own word, “poisonous” religious junk literature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of new, first edition books are printed each day, and thousands of books go out of print each day.  Regardless of their subject, most of them are tripe. They were not worth printing in the first place, they are not worth reading now, and they will not be worth keeping to catch dust on shelves or in attics.  Keep or share the few good ones, and toss the dross.  They’re &lt;em&gt;yours.&lt;/em&gt; You have the right to dump your books, just not somebody else’s.  Don’t worry, somewhere, somebody else will be keeping their copy of the rubbish you cast off, but that’s their problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still stymied by the taboo against throwing away any books, think about how automatic, how reflex is your reaction to the object itself, &lt;em&gt;a book.&lt;/em&gt; Try this thought experiment:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you find on your doorstep a single page flyer from some horrid racist hate group. You look at it, curse at whatever low life creep left it there, and rip it up.  Now imagine instead that it is two pages. It has the same content, but it’s folded and stapled into a pamphlet. You curse and rip it up just the same.  Now imagine instead that it’s twenty pages folded and stapled into a booklet with a cardstock cover.  Exactly the same revolting and infuriating lies are inside, but now it’s beginning to resemble a book. Maybe you begin to hesitate about trashing it.  Ask yourself how far along does this have to go toward resembling a book until it becomes the sacred object that must never be destroyed no matter what its content?  If you can’t bring yourself to destroy it, then somewhere along the way you have switched from assessing its value by its content to assessing its value by its physical form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe in this way you can see that you are attached to the object, to the form of these things, instead of making a judgment about their value or lack of value.  Maybe you can shrug off your old injunctions against destroying &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; book no matter what it is, and be able to mindfully choose what is yours to keep and what is yours to discard.   Get rid of clutter, claptrap and crap. Be free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

It is intended simply as a repository of all of the things that I couldn't easily fit into the previous two TAM posts as well as some of the cooler pictures that didn't go well into either of those. I will not even attempt to transition between the bits and the bobs, so chances are each paragraph will be completely unrelated to the ones above and below it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our first bit of randomness is the picture to the right. Someone wrote that on the whiteboard and I thought it was damn funny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My answer? I suspect they'll move on to Alison Smith now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I heard this but didn't see it: apparently during one of the fifteen-minute breaks, a couple of guys were juggling out in the hallway. Penn walked out of the ballroom, stopped, and looked at them. There was a moment of silence during which an unspoken understanding passed between them. Penn inclined his head almost imperceptibly, and they tossed him the balls. What followed was a free Penn Jilette juggling show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's amazing how deeply embedded gambling is into the Las Vegas culture. Nowhere I went was lacking for slot machines. 7/11? Slot machines. Circle K? Slot machines. Pizza shop? Slot machines. Mall? Slot machines. They're as ubiquitous as pop machines in any other part of the country, and I imagine the residents of Las Vegas view them in exactly the same way. They're just part of the landscape. For me, it was odd and kind of funny to go into a restaurant and see slot machines lining one wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I got this picture taken of me and Randi:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbDpPhSD2I/AAAAAAAAAsg/3L0z8TfXH2M/s1600-h/DSCF0419.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="A coworker told me he looks like an angry old wizard." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbDpPhSD2I/AAAAAAAAAsg/3L0z8TfXH2M/s320/DSCF0419.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But before this one came out, the kind photographer had snapped a shot wherein I was talking. He showed me, and I said "Oh, sorry. I was talking in that one. Could we take another one really quick?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Randi replied "Good Lord, why don't you shut the hell up so we can take the picture?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did, the picture was taken, I thanked Randi for, well, being Randi, and he said "You're welcome. And thanks for keeping your mouth shut."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jay Novella read the quote of the week on Friday, he asked for the audience's help when he said the quote-maker's name in that way he always says it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/1eklp4iqSys%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=323" width="400" height="323"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another video: Teller really can speak!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/aOAGqHzofqI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=323" width="400" height="323"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's one of the slot machines from the South Point. It's a very ironic slot machine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbGOAtZwkI/AAAAAAAAAso/1TlCKWzqIzs/s1600-h/DSCF0438.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I wasn&amp;#39;t the only one in the buffet line taking pictures of this puppy." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbGOAtZwkI/AAAAAAAAAso/1TlCKWzqIzs/s320/DSCF0438.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Friday night, after the SGU dinner was over, I talked for a brief moment with &lt;a href="http://badastronomy.com"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know how he remembers it, but here's my recollection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wanted to ask him a quick question, but saw, to my dismay, that he had been cornered by this heavyset, heavy-lidded, smug-looking motherfucker who had been walking around all day saying stupid things to famous skeptics who were too polite to tell him he wasn't making any sense. Well, I approached them to hear this guy making a really obtuse point about the pronunciation of "Uranus." Phil responded by saying "Well, technically, it's 'Ouranos' in the original Greek," but the guy just plowed over him to give other, alternative pronunciations that he had heard. Phil seemed to be trying to grasp this guy's point, but there was none evident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I decided to cut in. I said "Well, one easy way to solve all of these problems is just to change its name to Urectum." Phil laughed and said "Yes, but that won't happen until at least the 2300s some time. That might be my favorite Futurama joke of all time." He then took that break in conversation to excuse himself to where he had to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in my memory, I saved the Bad Astronomer from an irritating meatbag. In his memory, he probably doesn't remember it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time, there was a lady on his arm that I assumed was the Bad Wife. If so, the Bad Wife is smokin' hot. Go, Phil!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I asked Adam Savage if he had yet figured out a way to test natural selection on Mythbusters. He shook his head and said it wasn't going to happen; it just wouldn't make good TV. I pointed out that they had aired a boring-ass test of rolling stones gathering moss. He acknowledged this, but said that a natural selection experiment wouldn't change anyone's mind anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During this picture with Yau Man Chan, he was hiding a bottle of beer behind my back because "I don't want to look drunk."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbJDMgrEFI/AAAAAAAAAsw/6ENl0_Uq1l8/s1600-h/DSCF0398.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="It was just after noon!" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbJDMgrEFI/AAAAAAAAAsw/6ENl0_Uq1l8/s320/DSCF0398.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I talked for a while with &lt;a href="http://shwood.squarespace.com/"&gt;Brian Brushwood&lt;/a&gt;. He was really cool and seemed to go out of his way to talk to anyone and everyone he saw. He has high hopes for the Star Wars "Old Republic" MMORPG; I very much do not. His &lt;a href="http://www.revision3.com/scamschool"&gt;Scam School&lt;/a&gt; series is awesome as hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took this picture of mentalist and Skeptologist Mark Edward outside the Skepchick villa. As it turns out, there where spirit entities present...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbU8IsGIdI/AAAAAAAAAs4/eKG9iHwlbXE/s1600-h/DSCF0431.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:240px;height:320px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmbU8IsGIdI/AAAAAAAAAs4/eKG9iHwlbXE/s320/DSCF0431.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apparently after I left the party, Brian Dunning showed a video of himself trying to hit a baseball while drunk, or something like that. At least that's what I heard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It occurs to me only now that I forgot to say what Jay Novella's Secret Project was that aired Saturday morning during the live SGU recording. It was a preliminary cut of a 22-minute show written and directed by Jay called "G Hunters," a parody of "Ghost Hunters" where, instead of plumbers, the hunters are all laid-off New York City construction workers. It was crude and ridiculous and I thought it was funny as hell. One of their ghost hunting tools was a vibrator they called the "rectoplasmic probe." Brilliant. I can't wait until they get it put up on YouTube. It was supposed to have been released on the 13th, but it is nowhere to be found. We do have &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfxXxQr1n0"&gt;the trailer&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I will answer to the people who left me suggestions and wishes for things to do while at TAM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, from GDad:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Collect one of those adult-themed flyers that people pass out on the street for each year of your life. (If you are 25, collect 25.) Scan them and post the pictures with commentary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I never made it to the strip, so nobody ever handed one to me. There were, however, banks of them at every crosswalk. They looked like newspaper vending machines except each one had a different booklet full of callgirls. I snagged one, and it his hilarious, but as I do most of my blogging from work, there's no way I'll be scanning it and making fun of it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also from GDad:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Oh, and visit a psychic. If you can convince Randi or one of the bigwigs to join you, incognito, then hilarity just might ensue! Then take pictures. It would be SWEET to see pics of someone like Teller wearing a fake mustache and going with you to Madame La Mystique's Psychic Readings and Pancakes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There wouldn't have been time. And there was never enough opportunity to ask any of the famous folks "Hey, you want to go to a psychic for a gag on my blog that ten people read?" which is good because I wouldn't have the stones to do it, anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, from Techskeptic:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;OK, then, this is what I want you to do at TAM:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out how to deal with it [the dilemma that we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; we're right, but so do the woos and the fundies]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That answer might very well be: Get Snarky. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, I didn't figure it out. In the least. But it did occur to me that at least when we say "We know we're right," we don't mean "Right" in an eternal sense; our knowledge hasn't been revealed magically and is always subject to change.

Cyberbullying techniques use modern communication technology to send derogatory or threatening messages directly to the victim or indirectly to others, to forward personal and confidential communication or images of the victim for others to see, and to publicly post denigrating messages

Nor only have I written about his epic stupidity but &lt;a href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/dt-modest-arch.html#dt-modest-16"&gt;I’ve written to him before&lt;/a&gt;. And even though I wrote in a very civil tone, I never got a response. And back then I pointed out the irony of his proudly quoting Benjamin Franklin in an article accusing those who don’t worship his god of being unpatriotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=104477"&gt;Now he’s ranting against the Freedom From Religion Foundation’s (FFRF) lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the separation of church and state from being clearly violated with an engraving of “&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/12/god-to-be-engraved-in-visitor-center/"&gt;In God We Trust&lt;/a&gt;” in the Capitol Visitors Center after it passed unanimously in the &lt;a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HC00131:@@@R"&gt;Senate &lt;/a&gt;and the House voted &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/roll_call/show/5841"&gt;410-8 in favor of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Norris doesn’t seem to have learned anything about patriotism, the constitution, or American history since last I wrote him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a fighter for the freedoms of speech and religion. They are our constitutional rights – what the First Amendment is all about. But those freedoms don’t give atheists the entitlement to eliminate or revise America’s religious heritage in the new $621 million taxpayer-provided &lt;a href="http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/index.html"&gt;Capitol Visitors Center, or CVC, in Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norris’ whole response is citing all the other violations of church and state as precedent. And in doing so, “The Texas Ranger” illustrates what I’ve been saying for a long time. The motto, the pledge, the congressional acknowledgment of Christmas, all the congressional prayers, etc, etc.–they’re not small issues that aren’t worth our time to challenge. Every issue that gets written off as something secular Americans shouldn’t be wasting their time on are used against. Every time Christians try to force Jesus into the public schools or into government, they will always cite all these little things as precedent. They’re say, we already in god in our motto, on our money, and in our Pledge of Allegiance, so why not ____?” You give these assholes an inch of rope and they will hang you by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I think those who voted against the engraving deserve to get recognized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rep. John Conyers&lt;/strong&gt; (D-MI)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Donna Edwards&lt;/strong&gt; (D-MD)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Mazie Hirono&lt;/strong&gt; (D-HI)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Michael Honda&lt;/strong&gt; (D-CA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. James McDermott&lt;/strong&gt; (D-WA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Ronald Paul&lt;/strong&gt; (R-TX)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Robert Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (D-VA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rep. Fortney Stark&lt;/strong&gt; (D-CA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s hear more from “The Texas Ranger”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could anyone have anything against the engraving of our nation’s motto, which is above the very speaker’s rostrum in the House of Representatives? How could anyone have anything against the same for the Pledge of Allegiance, which has been recited each day since its inception in both houses of Congress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually Chuck, the “Under God” part wasn’t added to the Pledge until 1954 as a McCarthyist way of saying “FUCK YOU” to the godless Commies. But thanks for playing.&lt;/p&gt;

Terry Kemple, president of the Florida chapter of the pro-theocracy Community Issues Council, proudly admits that they knowingly falsely attributed quotes promoting their own ideology to great historical figures to sell their anti-separation of church and state message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billboards showcase quotes from early American leaders like John Adams, James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. Most of the quotes portray a national need for Christian governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others carry the same message but with fictional attribution, as with one billboard citing George Washington for the quote, “It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe there’s a document in Washington’s handwriting that has those words in that specific form,” Kemple said. “However, if you look at Washington’s quotes, including his farewell address, about the place of religion in the political sphere, there’s no question he could have said those exact words.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy just comes out and says George Washington never said what we’re specifically claiming he said but since it will fool people, that’s okay. What?! I seem to recall something in the Bible about baring false witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see if Kemble is right that Washington could have said those quotes. &lt;a href="http://catsoldier.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/pants-on-fire.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://catsoldier.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/pants-on-fire.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=150" alt="" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here are a few REAL quotes from George Washington:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the animosities which have existed among mankind, those which are caused by difference of sentiments in religion appear to be the most inveterate and distressing, and ought most to be deprecated. I was in hopes that the enlightened and liberal policy, which has marked the present age, would at least have reconciled Christians of every denomination so far that we should never again see the religious disputes carried to such a pitch as to endanger the peace of society. &lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;[George Washington, letter to Edward Newenham, October 20, 1792; from George Seldes, ed., &lt;em&gt;The Great Quotations&lt;/em&gt;, Secaucus, New Jersey: Citadel Press, 1983, p. 726]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is nothing which can better deserve our patronage than the promotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness. &lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;[George Washington, address to Congress, 8 January, 1790]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are good workmen, they may be from Asia, Africa or Europe; they may be Mahometans, Jews, Christians of any sect, or they may be Atheists…. &lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;[George Washington, to Tench Tighman, March 24, 1784, when asked what type of workman to get for Mount Vernon, from &lt;em&gt;The Washington papers&lt;/em&gt; edited by Saul Padover]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…I beg you be persuaded that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution. &lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;[George Washington, to United Baptists Churches of Virginia, May, 1789 from &lt;em&gt;The Washington papers &lt;/em&gt;edited by Saul Padover]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat it, Kemble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that Kemble was considered last year for the Republican nomination to replace a state representative? I bet I can guess which political party too.&lt;/p&gt;

And a few days ago Evalyn Gates provided a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/13/guest-post-evalyn-gates-on-cosmic-magnification-or-invasion-of-the-giant-blue-space-amoebas/"&gt;wonderful guest post&lt;/a&gt; on gravitational lensing. This seems like an opportune time to note that gravitational lensing and total solar eclipses are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting predictions of Einstein’s new theory of relativity was that gravity would cause light to bend. Imagine you are looking at a distant source of light, for example a star, or a faraway galaxy, or a quasar at the edge of the Universe. And let’s assume that, along the line-of-sight to the distant source there’s a massive object, for example the Sun, or a black hole, or a galaxy, or a cluster of galaxies. The gravity from the massive object will “pull” on the photons as they pass, shifting their paths, and thereby affecting the image that we see in our telescopes. In the simple case of a distant point source of light (e.g., a far away star), and a compact spherically symmetric lens (e.g., a black hole), the bending angle is given by&lt;br&gt;

In this equation M is the mass of the lens, r is the minimum distance between the (unperturbed) line-of-sight to the source and the lens, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light. This was a crucial prediction of Einstein’s new theory, and one way to test it was to see if the stars on the sky “jump” as the Sun (which is quite massive, and traverses the sky quite briskly) comes nearby on the sky. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/eclipse.jpg" title="total solar eclipse (July 22, 2009)"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/eclipse.jpg" alt="total solar eclipse (July 22, 2009)" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you plug in the appropriate numbers above ((G/c^2)*M_sun = 1.5 km [&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrized_unit_system"&gt;geometric units&lt;/a&gt;], R_sun = 700,000 km), you find that a star should shift on the sky by 1.75 arcseconds (8.57e-6 radians) as the Sun approaches. There’s one slight snag in measuring this effect: the Sun is sort of bright. When it’s up in the sky it can be a little hard to see what the stars are doing. By the time it’s dark and you can see stars, the Sun is far away on the sky (e.g., below the horizon), and there’s no longer a measurable effect. But nature conveniently provides a very elegant solution to this problem: the total Solar eclipse. In one of the more mysterious coincidences (or is it an argument for “intelligent design”?), it turns out that the Moon and the Sun have very similar angular sizes, when seen from Earth. So every now and then the Moon crosses right in front of the Sun and blocks it out. The sky goes dark. The stars come out in the middle of the day. It even becomes possible to see stars near the very edge of the Sun. Nature conveniently provides the perfect system in which to validate the general relativity prediction of gravitational lensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a habit in science of simplifying the historical progression. Einstein’s initial 1911 prediction was off by a factor of two (giving hope to us mere mortals). Over the next few years a number of expeditions were mounted to test his prediction, but all of them failed (e.g., bad weather, World War I). This gave Einstein time to discover his error, and in 1915 he fixed his result, arriving at the equation above. The definitive (though subsequently controversial) measurement was performed by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Stanley_Eddington"&gt;Sir Arthur Eddington&lt;/a&gt; in 1919. He observed the positions of stars during a total eclipse, claimed to confirm Einstein’s prediction, and vaulted Einstein to fame. In one of the best newspaper headlines ever, the New York Times &lt;del&gt;front page&lt;/del&gt; page 17 announced: “LIGHTS ALL ASKEW IN THE HEAVENS; Men of Science More or Less Agog Over Results of Eclipse Observations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve come a long way. Gravitational lensing is now one of our best probes of the Universe, revealing the presence of dark matter, and maybe eventually becoming a sensitive probe of dark energy. I’m super bummed I didn’t get to see the total eclipse a few hours ago. But I have every confidence that the stars were all appropriately askew, and that people were appropriately agog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>daniel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248247276905"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=824">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2107c3b8376b3b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="biologic institute"/><category term="biology"/><category term="calvinism"/><category term="charles darwin"/><category term="discovery institute"/><category term="dna"/><category term="evolution"/><category term="intelligent design"/><category term="seattle"/><category term="signature in the cell"/><category term="stephen meyer"/><category term="total depravity"/><title type="html">Hell in a Cell: An evening with the Discovery Institute</title><published>2009-07-22T05:59:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T05:59:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/07/21/hell-in-a-cell-an-evening-with-the-discovery-institute/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a number of perks to living in Seattle.  You can get espresso &lt;a href="http://www.espressodental.com/index.htm"&gt;at the dentist&lt;/a&gt;.  Bruce Lee’s grave is only &lt;a href="http://www.zipcon.net/~dunbar/Bruce.htm"&gt;a short bus ride away&lt;/a&gt;.  You can’t spit without hitting &lt;a href="http://www.accidentalhedonist.com/index.php?title=quick_seattle_food_trivia&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;tb=1&amp;amp;pb=1"&gt;a teriyaki restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.  And, of course, whenever the Discovery Institute has a &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;amp;id=1171&amp;amp;program=CSC-SITC&amp;amp;isEvent=true"&gt;book signing&lt;/a&gt; to promote their latest anti-scientific tract, it’s super-convenient to just drop in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I had some professional interest as well, as I’ve been thinking about organizing a book signing for &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/book/"&gt;Your Religion Is False&lt;/a&gt;, and I wanted to see how it was done.  However, my plan has always been more on the “card table on a street corner” scale than the “auditorium in the Seattle Art Museum” scale, and much of what I learned tonight doesn’t really apply.  (Especially since I’m not particularly confident in my ability to get C-SPAN to show up at &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; book party.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, in case I didn’t mention it already, is Stephen Meyer’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061472786?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=brightwalton-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061472786"&gt;Signature in the Cell&lt;/a&gt;, which I was sort of hoping was going to have something to do with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell"&gt;Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell&lt;/a&gt;.  (After sitting through the presentation, I’m mostly sure the two are unrelated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off with a video featuring Ben Stein, which I later learned was an excerpt from his autobiographical film &lt;i&gt;No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/i&gt;.  “Steve,” he asked, “what qualifies you to question the scientific theories of a man so genius that he’s buried &lt;a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/20020228.html"&gt;right next to Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;?”  (I think the question was sarcastic, but with Ben Stein it’s always hard to tell.)  “This debate won’t be settled by numbers,” Meyer responded, “but with computerized animations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I am having trouble reading my notes, but the point raised was either “science can’t solve the mystery of the origin of life,” “screwing can’t be the story of wing of Kate,” or “scary carrot where mystical long plate.”  Probably the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making fun of T.H. Huxley for &lt;a href="http://thewaytheballbounces.blogspot.com/2009/06/quote-of-day-simple-homogenous-globule.html"&gt;not understanding&lt;/a&gt; the complexity of a cell, Meyer started playing with Snap Lock beads, which are supposed to demonstrate some sort of thing about DNA and/or proteins.  (Curiously, if you search for “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=mozilla-20&amp;amp;index=blended&amp;amp;link_code=qs&amp;amp;field-keywords=snap%20lock%20beads&amp;amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search"&gt;snap lock beads&lt;/a&gt;” on Amazon, Meyer’s book is the third result, making me suspect that the beads are more integral to his argument than I realized.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, Meyer showed us a super-elaborate computer animation of gene expression.  Although he didn’t explicitly say so, it was obvious that such a computer animation was the creative output of an intelligent designer, implicitly bolstering his main point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we discussed the “&lt;a href="http://thednaenigma.com/"&gt;DNA Enigma&lt;/a&gt;“, which (if you click on it) is apparently the Discovery Institute’s website.  You see, if you have a computer, and you want it to do something different, you have to download new code.  And the same is true for life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This computer analogy was to appear repeatedly throughout the evening, as was the Bill Gates quote “DNA is like a computer program but far, far more advanced than any software we’ve ever created.”  (I wanted to ask Meyer what the DNA equivalent of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clippy-letter.PNG"&gt;Clippy&lt;/a&gt; was, but I didn’t get a chance.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around now, Meyer made an awful joke about Calvinism, which the audience just ate up.  (It wasn’t a &lt;a href="http://datingjesus.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/happy-birthday-john-calvin/#comment-9247"&gt;lightbulb&lt;/a&gt; joke.  I’m thinking that maybe it involved &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism#Total_depravity"&gt;total depravity&lt;/a&gt;, but only because I know a lot of jokes that do.  I also know a lot of jokes about things that are black and white and red all over and can’t turn around in an elevator, but it definitely wasn’t one of those.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we learned about the principle of “invoking causes now in operation.”  You see, if you were to find ash all over the bottom of Mt. St. Helens, it would be more plausible to attribute it to a volcanic eruption than to an earthquake, simply because we have experience with volcanoes producing ash, but not with earthquakes doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly (and here’s where the magic happens), if we were to find “computer code” in the DNA of a cell, it would be more plausible to attribute it to Mountain-Dew-swilling nerds than to Charles Darwin, simply because we have experience with caffeinated losers writing code.  (He left out the “God is a caffeinated loser.  QED” slide, probably because of time contraints.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were further parallels.  DNA uses &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29"&gt;design patterns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing"&gt;unit testing&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"&gt;Model-view-controller architecture&lt;/a&gt;.  So-called “Junk DNA” can be seen as a sort of &lt;a href="http://creation.com/dna-marvellous-messages-or-mostly-mess"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;, albeit one with spectacularly-lousy driver support.  And as soon as we go to the library and check out some more books on computers and learn more programming concepts, we’re going to draw up even more bad analogies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended with a message to those who’d dismiss ID as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/a&gt;: you’re wrong.  It’s actually the argument from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, Meyer’s argument is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) According to Bill Gates, DNA is like a computer program.&lt;br&gt;
(2) Because I am unfamiliar with the field known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming"&gt;genetic programming&lt;/a&gt;, every computer program I’ve ever heard of has had a developer.&lt;br&gt;
(3) Charles Darwin once used the principle of &lt;a href="http://www.soc.iastate.edu/sapp/phil_sci_lecture18.html"&gt;Inference To The Best Explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
(4) Even though Darwin was a wicked, wicked man, I’m going to use that same principle to refute him.  It will be, you know, irony.&lt;br&gt;
(5) I say that intelligent design is the best explanation for the computer-program-like-ness of DNA.&lt;br&gt;
(6) Therefore, &lt;i&gt;by Darwin’s own reasoning&lt;/i&gt;, intelligent design must be true.&lt;br&gt;
(7) Please buy my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there was an exceptionally boring question and answer period, which mostly consisted of people referencing parts of the books they’d particularly enjoyed and wondering aloud why those parts hadn’t been incorporated into the brief presentation.  As I hadn’t read the book, I was unable to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only interesting question came from a woman who asked what &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/tag/francis-collins/"&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt; thought of the book.  Despite his prominent opposition to intelligent design, it was decided that he might enjoy the chapter explaining the uncanny parallels between triunely-frozen waterfalls and computer code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Chapman followed this with a moderately-thrilling appeal for donations, at which point I left and checked Amazon, where I discovered that Meyer was creaming me in sales rank.

We came across a hare that did not seem too afraid of us.  I suppose we're not the most terrifying large mammals in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SmaRt9I5ZPI/AAAAAAAAAuE/UGNy_kG-aSg/s1600-h/DSC00240.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SmaRt9I5ZPI/AAAAAAAAAuE/UGNy_kG-aSg/s400/DSC00240.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of which, there have been a couple of polar bear sightings, including by the field course participants and this one which was seen from the zodiac.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SmaQo0zKVdI/AAAAAAAAAt8/UVJeVc-iOks/s1600-h/DSC00177.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/SmaQo0zKVdI/AAAAAAAAAt8/UVJeVc-iOks/s400/DSC00177.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It hasn't been all hard work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Indian astrologers&lt;/span&gt; are predicting violence and turmoil across the world as a result of this week’s total &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;solar eclipse&lt;/span&gt;, which the superstitious and religious view as a sign of potential doom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no! The moon has briefly blocked our view of the sun! This sort of thing never happens ever! We’re doomed! DOOMED!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of a bitch! There are anti-vaccinationists that aren’t even this stupid. These guys need to stop watching &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt; as if its a documentary. Solar eclipses don’t have supernatural powers. Maybe we should change Groundhog Day to Stupid Indian Astrologer Day. If they get scared by their own shadow, it means another Dark Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Hindu mythology&lt;/span&gt;, the two demons &lt;span style="border-bottom:1px dashed #0066cc;background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Rahu&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;Ketu&lt;/span&gt; are said to “swallow” the sun during eclipses, snuffing out its life-giving light and causing food to become inedible and water undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women are advised to stay indoors to prevent their babies developing &lt;span&gt;birth defects&lt;/span&gt;, while prayers, fasting and ritual bathing, particularly in holy rivers, are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artonyou.com/Baby%20Demon.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.artonyou.com/Baby%20Demon.jpg" alt="" width="143" height="216"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Oh no! Protect the pregnant women from shadow of the moon!!! Demons! Why’s it always got to be demons? The last thing I want to hear when I call for tech support is hearing some moron telling me my computer isn’t working because the demons that ate the sun have used their voodoo on my operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my favorite Indian, Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association, is on the case. You might remember Sanal as the guy who &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNoX0XKUZlk"&gt;volunteered to have some voodoo guy kill him on live, national television with nothing but magic spells&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice it to say, he’s still very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background:transparent none repeat scroll 0 0"&gt;Sanal Edamaruku&lt;/span&gt;, president of the &lt;span&gt;Indian Rationalist Association&lt;/span&gt;, dismissed such &lt;span&gt;doomsday predictions&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Primarily, what we see with all these soothsayers and astrologers is that they’re looking for opportunities to enhance their business with predictions of danger and calamity,” he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have been very powerful in India but over the last decade they have been in systematic decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep fighting the crazy over there, Sanal. We’re counting on you.&lt;/p&gt;

I suppose people are assuming that I cover the Stupid Animal Communication Stories desk.  And often I have.  But I have been procrastinating, because I am getting tired of being the animal grammar killjoy.  People are beginning to think I hate monkeys and dogs and parrots and dolphins and such (my previous posts include &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000400.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000525.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001039.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003334.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004428.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004511.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005329.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005443.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and probably others).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little animals in question (it's cottontop tamarins again) are cute.  I don't have anything against them, or against the experiments on them being done by people like Marc Hauser.  In the present case, the team was led by Ansgar Endress.  And here is the evidence for these little creatures' ability to "recognize bad grammar".  It's quite simple, and I don't think it's going to get them jobs as copy editors.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It turns out that if you expose a cottontop tamarin to a recording of someone saying &lt;i&gt;shoy-bi&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shoy-la&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shoy-ro&lt;/i&gt;, etc., over and over again for a whole day, they get used to it; and then the next day if you do it some more, but then interrupt the monotony with the sound of someone saying &lt;i&gt;bi-shoy&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;la-shoy&lt;/i&gt;, they look at the sound source.  It's novel to them now, and the novelty surprises them a little bit, so they look at the loudspeaker.  That's it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clever monkeys: they know the sound sequences of the current ambient environment, and they're alert to what's new in the auditory environment. But really: recognizing bad grammar?  I suppose Harvard behavioral scientists have to make their papers sound potentially relevant to cognition, and BBC science reporters have to make stories sound potentially interesting, and a headline like "Monkeys recognize changes in their auditory environment" would not set the world (or the World Service) on fire.  But that seems to be what we have here.  The researchers have just dressed up the description of the recorded sounds in linguistic terminology ("prefixation", "suffixation").  But it's not clear to me that a monkey's ability to notice the difference between &lt;i&gt;shoybi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bishoy&lt;/i&gt; is any more linguistically interesting than an ability to notice the difference between thump-splash and splash-thump, or to notice that your door chime has just gone &lt;sub&gt;DONG&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;DING&lt;/sup&gt; instead of &lt;sup&gt;DING&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;DONG&lt;/sub&gt; or that you just changed the radio station.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;“The constant smile in his eyes. His joy for life,” said one parent. “Unwavering affection,” said another. “While this is a trait we try to curtail because of stranger danger (can’t have my son hugging the pizza man forever, you know) I really love that he wants to touch others.  It’s not incessant anymore and he can verbalize why it’s important to him: that he really likes/loves some people and wants to express that.  Again, we try to curtail that with people other than family, because some teachers don’t even like to be hugged.  But, I see touch as being something we’ve lost due to political correctness, true danger and litigiousness.  I like that he attends a school that doesn’t have the silly rules about hugging friends.  As long as his friends want to be hugged, I think this is okay and I really, really love that about him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:160px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/traits.jpg" alt="Image: Jarcaj, Panoramio" width="150" height="113"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Jarcaj, Panoramio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t get enough of his imagination — not like you might think, though,” said another. “Sometimes he’ll be staring at a corner of the room and will just start to giggle incessantly.  If I only knew what he was seeing or thinking, how&lt;br&gt;
being able to giggle like that would make me feel so much better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We live the spectrum,” said a parent of three, “all high-functioning with three distinct representations.  My&lt;br&gt;
4-year-old is unstoppably curious about any sensory stimuli, full of energy and willing to explore anything.  Our 8-year-old is low-tone and sensory defensive, but the sweetest when interacting 1:1  in familiar environments.  Our 14-year-old is challanged by the outside world, wanting to fit in but knowing and valuing his differences.”&lt;/p&gt;

I'll dispense with the formal introductions - most &lt;em&gt;Swift &lt;/em&gt;readers know about Westboro, and those who don't may inform themselves quickly by clicking &lt;a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff's article concluded with this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore these people. Their message is so over-the-top that they don't need debunking. Let them blow away and take their rightful place next to any of the thousands of other self-serving hypocrites pretending to have a calling from a higher power. Learn to be comfortable with the fact that there are lying, evil bastards out there who want your attention, and understand that you win when you don't give it to them. We all do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiments like Jeff's have been expressed by countless sensitive souls since the Westboroans began their protest ministry. But I disagree, on grounds both moral and practical. After all, no high-minded article could possibly inspire &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;people to ignore a group as loud and incendiary as The Westboro Baptist Church, and by ignoring them ourselves we only cede our place at their demonstrations to bullies with their own theological axes to grind - bullies who will engage the church far less thoughtfully than would, say, a public of even-tempered skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think such abandonment is right and proper. Even those without any sympathy for the Westboroan plight have surely been surprised at the rapidity with which good manners disappear whenever someone raises the subject. Otherwise peaceable people articulate murderous fantasies; otherwise tolerant people advocate gag laws. The Westboro Baptist Church, it seems, deserves whatever it gets, and no breach of civil liberties nor sudden lapse of decorum is too egregious so long as Fred Phelps and his brood are the targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this is what we say when we suggest that the sane and secular give Westboro a wide berth. Let brutes deal with brutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It's a bad idea.</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Brandon K.

Basically my thought was something along the lines of "For cripes sake, hasn't this horse been beat to death yet?". What was I thinking about? Arguments for God of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Over the millennia there have been lots of &lt;s&gt;excuses&lt;/s&gt; arguments that try to justify a belief in god. Some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Cosmological/First Cause&lt;br&gt;Cosmological/Fine Tuning&lt;br&gt;Ontological&lt;br&gt;Anthropological&lt;br&gt;Teleological&lt;br&gt;Moral&lt;br&gt;Existential&lt;br&gt;Pascals Wager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;And a variety of others. These tired and boring defenses have been brought out time and time again as if they are new or confounding in any way. They aren't because they have been answered and the conversation never goes beyond it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;For example, first cause. We have heard it. Science has brought you a concept about conservation of energy, cause and effect, and so on. Now you wish to turn that around and make it an excuse for a god existence. But we witness lots of uncaused things. For example radioactive decay. Given a chunk of Uranium 238, which decays to thorium 234, there is no way to predict which atom will be the next one to change. When an atom does change, through alpha emission, there is no cause (that we know of), it was just the next random one to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;We find uncaused events in quantum mechanics when proper conditions are set up, where particles appear out of nowhere, uncaused (I am greatly simplifying). But its true, these seem like nit picks when compared to the creation of the universe and all the energy that is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Fine, lets look at our experience with classical physics versus relativity versus quantum mechanics. Newtonian physics "seems" right because it models the universe within our human experiences. Only when we start studying huge speeds, gigantic masses or tiny particles that are outside of our normal experience does it fail to model observations very well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;So once we move outside of our human experience with respect to such large energies, far larger masses, enormous distances and measures of time that make no sense to us puny humans, why shouldn't we think that something came from nothing &lt;em&gt;with respect to our perception&lt;/em&gt;, and even if it did, so what? That means we are simply unable to define what was before, if there even &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;But alas, no, for some reason "I don't know" is not good enough, so God must step in. Never mind all the "I don't knows" that go along with that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;So, in fact I'm pretty tired of these arguments. They are boring, they always end up with theists pretending they understand physics (or biology). They have already been debated by people far more qualified than me and where as it gotten us (or the theists)? If you want an example of a typical conversation like this &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/06/proof-that-god-exists-not.html"&gt;check out a recent one at Skeptico's place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;So I have only 3 questions for them. I have been thinking about these questions for some time but never really had a chance to use them. I may not be brilliant, perhaps these have been used before. I've never seen them. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is God all powerful and currently using that power in this universe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The first question is to assure myself that the theist is sure that miracle can and do happen now. If we are talking about a watchmaker god that sits back and laughs at us, then that's a different conversation, and one basically useless. If God isn't acting in this universe now, what good is he? How is that different than no god? I want to be sure that the person I am speaking with assures me that God can do anything. Recently when I posed this question I was given these verses to back up the positive answer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens...When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and a the son of man that you care for him?" Psalm 8&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He (Jesus) is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible...all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together." Colossians 1:15-17&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He (Jesus) is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power." Hebrews 1:3&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does God know me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The second question is to be sure that the person I am speaking with thinks that God knows everything about me. More than I may even know myself. I know that the answer to this is invariably yes, it has to be God is omniscient right? As a response to this question I was given these phrases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You (God) are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother's breast. On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother's womb you have been my God." Psalm 22: 9-10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Honestly, I read that and I have no idea how this says anything about God being omniscient. The person I was having the conversation with was quick to point out that just because God knows me, doesn't mean he is going to perform some parlor tricks to get me to believe. But that brings me to my third question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does God love me and want me to be saved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If god really loves me and wants me to be saved and go to heaven, why wouldn't he perform a simple trick. It would not take much. My example was to hold out my hand and look up. If they could see this, they may ask what I am doing. I respond, "I am waiting for a frog to appear in my hands". This sort of thing could happen to atheists all over the world and we no longer would be talking about existence proof, we would be talking about which religion is the right one. We would all be deists pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Of course when I present the frog conclusion, I was responded to with the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U embarrass urself w/ ur lack of comprehension. What do you think...God is some jack-n-the-box in the sky just waiting to perform for u and ur silly mindless friends?

&lt;p&gt;Happy 1st Birthday, Skepacabra!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2008/07/19/what-i-think-about-your-god/"&gt;my first blog&lt;/a&gt;, I began with a detailed explanation of my thoughts on gods and religion. Fortunately, few blogs after that were me-centric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stated my goal for this blog in the “About” section but it’s worth revisiting here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this blog is to promote the methods of critical thinking and scientific skepticism. A pretty good summation of the frequent topics being discussed here can be found in the Michael Shermer quote on the top of the blog’s main page. Some specific topics of particular interest to me aside from science news are: Creationism/Intelligent Design, alternative medicine, psychic claims, ghost hunters, UFO sightings, Big Foot, Chupacabra, and all matter of bullshit. In fact, if you’ve seen the TV shows Penn &amp;amp; Teller’s Bullshit or Mythbusters then you probably already have a good idea of the kinds of things I’ll be discussing in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think I’ve done an okay job of keeping to that goal. Sure, like PZ Myers, I sometimes come down really hard on bullshit. But contrary to some commenters’ insisting that I’m close-minded, if I’m harsh on something, it’s not because I dismissed it out of hand. In all likelihood, I’ve researched it prior to my writing about it and simply reached the conclusion that it’s crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today just happens to be the 84th anniversary of the end of the Scopes Monkey Trial. Contrary to popular belief, Scopes sadly lost that trial. Though it was later overturned. But that trial set back science education for decades while students continued to be taught nonsensical creationism in public schools long after it’d been debunked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/more-anniversaries/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/nZbPaRuNkyY/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;84 years ago today was a dark day in American history. May we never repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll recall that iPS cells are normal cells - usually skin cells - reprogrammed to act as though they are stem cells. The methodology is well within reach of any laboratory previously working on stem cells, and many research groups have dived into the fray since the first publication of the reprogramming method. Rapid progress has been made in a very short time, a characteristic state of affairs for biotechnology these days. As a recent paper shows, iPS researchers have reached the point of demonstrating regeneration of damaged hearts in mice. Non-scientists might prefer the press release to the original paper: The ultimate goal is to use iPS cells derived from patients to repair injury. Using a person's own cells in the process eliminates the risk of rejection and the need for anti-rejection drugs. One day this regenerative medicine strategy may alleviate the demand for organ transplantation limited by donor shortage, the researchers say. ...

&lt;p&gt;Not as bad as having to &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/01/31/indian-wedding/"&gt;marry a tree before your husband&lt;/a&gt;, but still nothing to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Indian astrologers are predicting violence and turmoil across the world as a result of this week’s total solar eclipse, which the superstitious and religious view as a sign of potential doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hindu mythology, the two demons Rahu and Ketu are said to “swallow” the sun during eclipses, snuffing out its life-giving light and causing food to become inedible and water undrinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women are advised to stay indoors to prevent their babies developing birth defects, while prayers, fasting and ritual bathing, particularly in holy rivers, are encouraged.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are Indian people so good with math and science, yet so prone to irrational, unscientific stupidity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s at least one voice of reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association, dismissed such doomsday predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Primarily, what we see with all these soothsayers and astrologers is that they’re looking for opportunities to enhance their business with predictions of danger and calamity,” he told AFP.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait!  He’s not the only one!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an &lt;em&gt;astrologer&lt;/em&gt; who also has some words of wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Siva Prasad Tata, who runs the Astro Jyoti website, straddles the two worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no need to get too alarmed about the eclipse, they are a natural phenomenon,” the astrologer told AFP.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow… that makes sense… does an astrologer actually have something intelligent to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But he added: “During the period of the eclipse, the opposite attracting forces are very, very powerful. From a spiritual point of view, this is a wonderful time to do any type of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will bring about good results, much more than on an ordinary day.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of a bitch…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another question: Why is &lt;strong&gt;Phil Hazlewood&lt;/strong&gt;, the presumably non-Indian reporter, writing about the astrologers and their predictions as if they deserve an objective hearing?  Just because you’re a journalist doesn’t mean both sides of your story have good points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not bias to say the astrologers are wrong.  That’s a fact.  So admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

Historically, Lovelace died young at age 36, while Babbage never completed his potentially revolutionary invention, but what if he had, and Ada Lovelace had lived?

The premise holds that proto-programmer (and sole legitimate child of Lord Byron) Ada Lovelace did not die at age 36, but instead helped inventor Charles Babbage develop the first computer — a fully functional Analytical Engine — after which they retired to battle crime using the power of mathematics (and rayguns).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The result is Steampunk Supreme.

Thomas Edison and Guglielmo Marconi -- who made radio a profitable commercial enterprise, even though Tesla technically came up with the idea first -- also make cameo appearances.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And who can forget Alan Moore's pre-&lt;i&gt;Watchmen&lt;/i&gt; creation, &lt;i&gt;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&lt;/i&gt;? Literary hero Alan Quartermain (&lt;i&gt;King Solomon's Mines&lt;/i&gt;) teams up with Mina Murray (&lt;i&gt;Dracula&lt;/i&gt;), the Invisible Man, Jekyll/Hyde, Tom Sawyer, and Captain Nemo (&lt;i&gt;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&lt;/i&gt;) at the end of the 19th century to -- you guessed -- foil another vast global conspiracy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The original works inspired countless spinoff movies, so it's not surprising that Hollywood took notice and turned &lt;i&gt;League&lt;/i&gt; into a feature film in 2003. We applaud this kind of creative cross-over, and can't wait to see what becomes of &lt;i&gt;Five Fists, Girl Genius&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Thrilling Adventures of Babbage and Lovelace&lt;/i&gt; as they fight the forces of evil -- with science!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/930owrsCrwI%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/qtDphCDULeQ%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-2131621741126487743?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Daytime television does make you stupid . . . or at least it makes the hosts stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if Oprah’s endless tirade of spiritual nonsense was not enough, now we have Whoopi Goldberg attempting to validate the moon landing hoax. Stating as evidence the fact that she is a fan of a conspiracy theory movie and even though she acknowledges that it is a fictional film, she says it still raises questions about the actual moon landing. Apparently she is also baffled by the fact that she can’t see the astronaut that shot the film footage of Apollo 11 because he didn’t wave into the camera. Barbara Walters does counter her with a half-hearted rhetorical attempt stating, “You don’t really doubt that the men landed on the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on Whoopi, at least learn to separate fact from fiction before you get up in front of millions of viewers. You owe us that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;a French word for the way people attempt to speak or sing in a foreign language that they don’t know very well. Often they mishear and misinterpret the word or lyrics and substitute them with familiar words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the comments on the Omniglot post suggest that the English equivalent is the noun &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000018.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;mondegreen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I've never heard anyone verbing mondegreen, and a bit of web search doesn't turn up much except for the http://twitter.com/mondegreened (which I'm sorry to say belong to someone named "Julian", not "Ed"), and a post on "&lt;a href="http://thebestamericanpoetry.typepad.com/the_best_american_poetry/2008/11/the-mondegreening-of-america.html"&gt;The mondegreening of America&lt;/a&gt;", and a few other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems that the key thing about the French word is the nonsense imitation of another language, which is more like a specialization of &lt;em&gt;doubletalk&lt;/em&gt; than a verbal equivalent of &lt;em&gt;mondegreen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/Search?ArianeWireIndex=index&amp;amp;q=yaourter&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;lang=FR"&gt;nothing available from Gallica&lt;/a&gt;,  nor &lt;a href="http://www.wordreference.com/fren/yaourter"&gt;from wordreference.com&lt;/a&gt;, nor from the Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française, so (pending asking Francophone friends) I need to fall back on general web search. And that turns up things like &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080513171427AADzGJ2"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Just for the story, in France, when we don't speak English and we want to imitate the sound, we call it "yaourter"(to yoghourt), the imitation sounds like a very nasal language, kind of like a baby crying. It mostly imitates the "cowboy" accent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or &lt;a href="http://www.ciao.fr/shabadabada__315947"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Prenez une poignée de bons amis, de préférence des amis aimant chanter, chantonner, fredonner ou même yaourter. Et qui n’ont pas spécialement peur, les liquides houblonnés aidant, de se cramer la honte dans des bars où ils sont pourtant connus. Mettez leur entre les pattes une petite boite carrée pleine de cartes, nommée Shabadabada, et laissez agir quelques heures. Observez le résultat : il semblerait qu’ils alternent des phases de faisage de gueule et d’autres de franche rigolade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again &lt;a href="http://pimpandpomme.typepad.fr/zeblog/musik/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… j&amp;#39;ai rajouté de la super musique dans le lecteur sur votre droite… Playlist à chanter, yaourter, meumeumer, hurler, casseroler aussi!…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples do make it seem as if &lt;em&gt;yaourter&lt;/em&gt; is a mode of vocal production, with any sense of "slip of the ear" being very much secondary. And it's not clear to me whether imitating the sound of another language is central to its meaning, or if it's rather something more like scat-singing, or sung double-talk, or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English has a lot of words for speaking or singing nonsensically, but I can't think of any word that refers specifically to nonsensical imitations of the speech of foreigners, although there's a long anglophone tradition of producing such imitations for the amusement of others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248224755117"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1594">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49ee64f7fae68010</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Monopsony</title><published>2009-07-22T00:58:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-22T00:58:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1594" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It isn't often that I encounter an English word that I don't know other than names of chemical compounds, but I recently learned a new word for something not all that obscure. In a context in which I expected the word &lt;i&gt;monopoly&lt;/i&gt;, I encountered &lt;i&gt;monopsony&lt;/i&gt;. At first I thought it was a mistake, but it recurred. It turns out that economists distinguish between &lt;i&gt;monopolies&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;monopsonies&lt;/i&gt;. When there is a single source for a product, that is a monopoly, but when there is only a single buyer for a product, that is a monopsony. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic example of a monopsony is what I have hitherto known as the Chinese salt monopoly. Throughout most of Chinese history, anybody could produce salt, but they had to sell it to the government, which then sold it to consumers. This is why the classic work of Chinese economics, the proceedings of a conference held in 81 BCE with appended commentary, is entitled  塩鉄論 &lt;i&gt;Discourses on Salt and Iron&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bill Poser</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248224588248"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/do_not_adjust_your_browsing_so.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8aabf6dd50210836</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Do Not Adjust Your Browsing  Software....</title><published>2009-07-21T22:54:17Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T22:54:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/uR0gIPhQ2k0/do_not_adjust_your_browsing_so.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/do_not_adjust_your_browsing_so.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's happening!!!  At 7:00 PM eastern time Science Blogs Dot Com bloggers who have gotten the memo will STOP BLOGGING and about one hour later the Scienceblogs.com system will be placed on life support for a Major Operation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time you will be able to read the blog, but at some point commenting will stop working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You might as well go over to &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/"&gt;Quiche Moraine&lt;/a&gt; and catch up on the great stuff we have been posting there!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, at an undetermined time (figure some time during the wee hours of the morning?) commenting capacities will resume as the blog is brought back to consciousness.  As it were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the blog comes back on, all those annoying timeouts and other issues that you, dear reader, see when you try to comment (and that we bloggers also encounter when posting and so on) will be fixed.  Everything will work fine. The operation of the Science Blog back end and commenting system will become veritably crispy, if not downright snappy.   &lt;/p&gt;

But the two stories about autistic kids with musical loves otherwise possess a nearly interchangeable story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand these stories are about kids being kids, having interests, gaining self-esteem and self-expression, falling into love with creativity.  Stuff that one hopes is part of the life of kids, any kids.  And yes, the activities these kids are doing would make decent local news stories if the kids weren't autistic too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, these stories do fall into the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/boring_autism_newsfeed_classification_101"&gt;boring autism news stories 101&lt;/a&gt; story of AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENTS!!!! (as well as contain some fairly barf-worthy &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/press_terminology_and_disablism"&gt;stigmatizing language&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, beneath both those surfaces, why should it come as a surprise that autistic kids, like any other kids, benefit hugely from doing stuff they like and are good at?  This isn't a kid question (ya'll know I typically make it policy not to blog about children, and this post is not about children but about some more universal ideas), because the same question can be asked why should it come as a surprise that autistic adults, like any adults, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/nurturing_art"&gt;benefit hugely from doing stuff they like&lt;/a&gt; and are good at, and participating on their own preferred terms in the community?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what the age, diagnosis, lack of diagnosis, or what all else, we are people, and (surprisingly? er...) we tend to benefit hugely from being treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248217836284"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/yay111111.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/87c63f12c093f83b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">YAY!!!!!11!!1!!111!!</title><published>2009-07-21T22:54:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T22:54:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/4wB0MNqWDt4/yay111111.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/yay111111.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone wanna guess who just joined Twitter after  MONTHS of &lt;strike&gt;nagging &lt;/strike&gt; convincing....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TxtOpAB0ckU/SmYr7WV9uYI/AAAAAAAAA0g/qi_jkhjxVdY/s1600-h/b4s_billboard072109_76993c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="text-align:center;margin:0px auto 10px;width:400px;height:266px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TxtOpAB0ckU/SmYr7WV9uYI/AAAAAAAAA0g/qi_jkhjxVdY/s400/b4s_billboard072109_76993c.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are a couple of problems with these billboards. Not only will it be tough to comprehend a long, complicated sentence when speeding down the highway, but also, some of them will have fictitious quotes. Even the group’s local chapter president, Terry Kemple, admits to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billboards showcase quotes from early American leaders like John Adams, James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. Most of the quotes portray a national need for Christian governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others carry the same message but with fictional attribution, as with one billboard citing George Washington for the quote, “It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe there’s a document in Washington’s handwriting that has those words in that specific form,” Kemple said. “However, if you look at Washington’s quotes, including his farewell address, about the place of religion in the political sphere, there’s no question he could have said those exact words.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the quotes are made up or not don’t seem to matter to Kemple and billboard financier Gregg Smith, since, as they assert, they are doing God’s work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Christian separation critics have scoffed at President Barack Obama’s assertion in April that Americans “do not consider ourselves a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Kemple and Smith were beginning to plan for the billboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s coincidental,” Kemple said. “I think God had his hand in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's by &lt;a href="http://www.dukehealth.org/physicians/FCD30429F0BE6B5385256DFD006A9161"&gt;Harold Koenig&lt;/a&gt;, who's one of the world's leading experts on religion and mental health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His conclusion: religious people are less likely to be depressed, anxious, or attempt suicide. The evidence is mostly cross-sectional – showing that depressed people are less likely to be religious, for whatever reason. But there are also a number of longitudinal studies, showing that people who are religious are less likely to become depressed in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For people with psychotic delusions, the picture is more complicated. They are frequently highly religious, but the longitudinal studies suggest that psychosis comes first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Koenig's conclusion, that religion can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, isn't terribly surprising. But what jumps out from the review is how many questions are left unanswered. For example,&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What's the magnitude of the effect? Is it big enough to make any meaningful difference? How does it compare with other factors that influence depression? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it effective in severe depression, or just in mild depression (where placebos are also highly effective)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it religious beliefs, or attendance, or simply the much more vague concept of 'spirituality' that is important? Koenig's review doesn't really distinguish between them, probably because, historically, studies into the effects of religion didn't tend to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;What does it all mean for the treatment of mental illness? In an &lt;a href="http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=787&amp;amp;xwm=true"&gt;accompanying paper&lt;/a&gt;, Marilyn Baetz and John Toews try to unpack this conundrum - and they fully admit that they don't have much to go on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They do give some practical advice, but even that demonstrates just how confusing this field can be for the unwary. They reckon that you can treat depression by encouraging a spirit of altruism, gratitude and forgiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's sound advice, no doubt. But I think that most atheists would rankle at the idea that these fall under the heading of 'religious and spiritual' interventions!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we really are still a very long way away from answering the key question. To boil it down, I want to know whether it's possible to treat depression by prescribing a dose of religion. And if it is, then is it more effective than other treatment options?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it turns out that a good way to treat depression is to pack people off to their local imam, then that really will raise some interesting ethical issues!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left"&gt;&lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0pt" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/2.0/uk/88x31.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This work by &lt;a href="http://bhascience.blogspot.com/" rel="cc:attributionURL"&gt;Tom Rees&lt;/a&gt; is licensed under a &lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp;amp; Wales License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1051713021757781960-1397401640196650459?l=bhascience.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I don't have much to compare it with, but I do wonder how I'm going to keep up with the little princess.  Mrs. Pal got us a Trail-a-Bike for Father's day---that's one of those "half bikes" you hook up to your own, effectively creating a tandem bike.  PalKid can hold on and peddle if she feels like it.  That's a serious workout.  When we were up north, I dragged her everywhere (and vice versa) and she dropped off too sleep nice and early every evening (which I wish I could have done, but 7:30 is pretty weak for a grown up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, for now, I'm still physically her better (aesthetically, not so much),  but I know she'll pass me pretty soon, and it'll be me whining about climbing up the hill to the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'll never ask her for "uppie".&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/07/poll-frankens-favorable-rating-improves-in-wake-of-legal-battle.php"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is partly a function of increased favorablity following the nasty recount process, but is also reminds us of something else:  There was a third candidate in this race.  If Dean Barkley was not in this race, would the outcome have been so close?  And, who would have won?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common knowledge on the street at the time of the election is that about two thirds of Barkley's votes would have been for Franken had Barkley not been in the race.  In addition, Franken was advancing on Coleman for the last several weeks.  In other words, if the election was held three weeks later, OR if Barkley was not in the race, Franken would have had a decisive if not overwhelming victory.  If both were true, Franken would have taken Coleman out by a landslide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I've been so frequently annoyed at calls to "just do it over" or statements that "no one really won" and so on.  Franke was behind.  Franken came from behind and passed colement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, consider this: If Franken was moving in on the vote count, then what about absentee votes cast days or weeks before the election?  Wouldn't more of those have been Franken votes had they been cast on election day? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/thoughts-while-watching-charlie-at-the-dentist/"&gt;Going to the dentist&lt;/a&gt; and getting his teeth checked without sedation or being restrained in something like a "papoose": This was one of the things I noted we've been able to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_miracles_but_lots_of_hard_work"&gt;teach Charlie through a lot of hard work&lt;/a&gt;, ours and most of all, &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/up-high-in-the-trees-and-at-the-dentist/"&gt;his own&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/51208072.html"&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/a&gt; features Dr. Jeff Kinner, who has, for the past two years, reserved Mondays to see only autistic children. Kinner notes that sometimes he'll see a child three to four times before actually starting to work on their teeth; he draws on techniques of Applied Behavior Analysis learned from occupational therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly going to the dentist is all-out sensory over-stimulating (not to mention painful) experience. We've been lucky to find a pediatric dentist who also devotes some of his time to seeing children with disabilities. But will there be similar professionals willing to see Charlie when he's an adult?&lt;/p&gt;

First off, total Solar Eclipses are rare enough, and spectacular when they happen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/eclipse.jpg" width="500" alt="eclipse.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, a total solar eclipse allowed us to first &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1919_einste.php"&gt;test Einstein's General Relativity&lt;/a&gt;!  A total Solar Eclipse happens when the Moon passes directly in between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/129-004-73C596D1.gif" width="500" alt="129-004-73C596D1.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This only happens &lt;i&gt;rarely&lt;/i&gt;, for three reasons.  First off, the Moon's orbit is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the same plane as the Earth and the Sun.  The Moon's orbit is inclined by about 5 degrees to the plane that the Earth orbits the Sun.  For comparison, the size that the Moon appears to take up in the sky (its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter"&gt;angular diameter&lt;/a&gt;) is only &lt;b&gt;half-a-degree&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/Earth-Moon%20Dynamic3.jpg" width="500" alt="Earth-Moon Dynamic3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that more than 90 percent of the time, the Moon's shadow isn't even in the same plane as the Earth.  But tomorrow, we'll get lucky, and the Moon will be in just the right part of its orbit to cast a shadow in Earth's plane.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing we need is for the Moon's shadow to fall in the Earth's plane &lt;b&gt;during&lt;/b&gt; the New Moon.  Why the New Moon?  Because this is when the Moon passes as close as possible to&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy#Astronomy"&gt;syzygy&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., perfect alignment) between the Earth and the Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/phasesMoon.jpg" width="500" alt="phasesMoon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only get about 12 or 13 of these a year.  And tomorrow, July 22, is, in fact, the New Moon.  So we've got two things in place: the Moon's shadow falling in Earth's plane &lt;i&gt;during&lt;/i&gt; the New Moon.  When this happens, we can see one of three things:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A partial eclipse, if the completely shadowed region (the umbra) lands off the Earth, but the penumbra lands on it.  On the other hand, if the umbra &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; land on the Earth, we'll see:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An annular eclipse, if the angular diameter of the Moon is smaller than the angular diameter of the Sun (i.e., if the Moon is close to apogee), or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total solar eclipse, if the angular diameter of the Moon is larger than the angular diameter of the Sun (i.e., if the Moon is close to perigee).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/Lunar_perigee_apogee.png" width="500" alt="Lunar_perigee_apogee.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I went and looked up the &lt;a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/pacalc.html"&gt;Moon's position&lt;/a&gt;, and the Moon makes its closest approach &lt;b&gt;of the year&lt;/b&gt; to the Earth at 8:15 PM (Universal Time) tonight, coming to within 357,464 km of the Earth (under 228,400 miles)!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only will the Moon's umbra fall on the Earth, it falls extremely closely to the &lt;i&gt;equator&lt;/i&gt; of the Earth.  Meaning that, during the New Moon, when the Moon is closest to the Earth (and appears largest in the sky), the Earth, Moon, and Sun will be &lt;b&gt;almost perfectly aligned&lt;/b&gt;.  The result?  A total solar eclipse that lasts &lt;i&gt;for over six minutes&lt;/i&gt;, the longest Solar Eclipse that will happen in all of our lifetimes.  These things come together very, very infrequently, less than once per century.  And it's happening &lt;b&gt;tomorrow&lt;/b&gt;!  Where can you see it from?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/TSE2009globe1b.JPG" width="512" alt="TSE2009globe1b.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anywhere on this path.  The official &lt;a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html"&gt;NASA eclipse page&lt;/a&gt; is here, but I've done a little digging and found where you can see the total eclipse!  If you live in India,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/TSE2009-fig02.GIF" width="512" alt="TSE2009-fig02.GIF"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in China,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/TSE2009-fig03.GIF" width="512" alt="TSE2009-fig03.GIF"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in Japan,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur/TSE2009-fig04.GIF" width="512" alt="TSE2009-fig04.GIF"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you're in luck.  In fact, if you live almost anywhere in the Eastern Hemisphere, you should be able to see a &lt;i&gt;partial eclipse&lt;/i&gt;, and you should also be able to tell that the Moon looks larger than the Sun!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Hey, Jim Fry, if you read this and you're in Shanghai right now, don't miss this!  And take some pictures for me!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you get the &lt;i&gt;total eclipse&lt;/i&gt;, you'll find that you can see stars &lt;b&gt;during the day&lt;/b&gt;.  I have never been so jealous of people who live in Asia as I am at this moment.  If anyone who reads this takes pictures and lives in an area where you can see the eclipse, feel free to send them to me!  If I get any good ones, I will happily post them here!  Enjoy the show; there's not going to be another one like it as long as you live!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_best_eclipse_of_the_centur.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248211310976"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/deep_sea_news/~3/C-nwiCSIVQQ/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc75861b127949e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Eye in the Sea camera to feature CarcassVision</title><published>2009-07-21T15:51:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T15:51:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/g28oU_ts9HM/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/deep_sea_news/~3/C-nwiCSIVQQ/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The Eye-in-the-Sea camera will be freshly baited with a frozen sea lion carcass in a camera deployment set for August 14th, in the deep Monterey Canyon.

It’s only getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Hallquist&lt;/strong&gt; feels that &lt;a href="http://www.uncrediblehallq.net/blog-project-announcement-thank-you-popular-science/"&gt;some people have been saying otherwise&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I get the impression [&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;] revives the current-science-communication-is-worthless line that Mooney, Nisbet, and their ilk have been using for awhile. This line is nonsense, and I know it’s nonsense because I know I’ve benefitted a lot from already-available popular science, and I’ve talked to other people who’ve benefitted from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I propose a blog project, a sort of one-shot carnival: write a blog post thanking popular science writers for whatever they’ve done for you…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I got into science-writing after reading &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;‘ &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/061861916X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=061861916X"&gt;The Ancestor’s Tale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  It was well after I became an atheist, and his few jabs at religion didn’t bother me at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a very interesting story, though, so I’ll tell another.  It’s about a great science communicator whose name I don’t remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my senior year of high school, my anatomy class went on a field trip to listen to the Man (I have no idea who he was) talk about the “latest science discoveries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just after the Human Genome Project made headlines.  They had just announced the sequencing of the human genome, but beyond that headline, I didn’t understand many of the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man who spoke explained to the audience of high-school students that we now knew approximately how many genes we had — far fewer than anyone had predicted.  Our gene count wasn’t very different from that of corn.  We shared many of our genes with mice and chimpanzees.  It was overwhelming and incredible all at once.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man also spoke about theoretical approaches scientists were taking to “cure” or slow down the HIV virus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing that talk, my close friend Sacha was so inspired, she decided right then to become a pharmacist.  (And she did!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science communication at its best involves passionate speakers, using terms everyone can understand, and inspiring them to learn more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/strong&gt; did it.  &lt;strong&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/strong&gt; does it.  The Man from my field trip did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who inspired you?  Share your story and &lt;a href="http://www.uncrediblehallq.net/blog-project-announcement-thank-you-popular-science/"&gt;let Chris know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

His original article asserted that "the 'New Atheists' are right-wing on foreign policy" because saying that religion is at the root of all evil gives comfort to those who would like to blame all US foreign policy issues on those "crazy Muslims."  Specifically, he calls out Dawkins for saying that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rooted in religion, as opposed to a secular land dispute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a number objections to Wright's argument, of course, but I do think he has a point that we should not get so wrapped up in opposing religion's (obviously negative) influence that we ignore other issues.  I'm sure others have discussed the problems with his argument &lt;i&gt;ad nauseum&lt;/i&gt;, so I'm going to leave that alone for now.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, I am going to focus on a complete blunder he commits in the follow-up piece.  While discussing whether Daniel Dennett's characterization of religion as a "virus of the mind" puts him in the same category, Wright gives us this howler:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Would Dawkins and Dennett say that religious belief is always, or even usually, &lt;b&gt;parasitic in the Darwinian sense--bad for the reproductive prospects of the host?&lt;/b&gt;  If so, how do you explain the number of Catholics in the world? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://picardfacepalm.com/"&gt;Facepalm!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me get this straight:  Wright is trying to say that &lt;i&gt;Darwinian&lt;/i&gt; logic dictates that a parasite should be "bad for the reproductive prospects of the host"?  That makes no fucking sense whatsoever.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clue: A parasite cannot live without a host.  The more hosts there are, the more potential living spaces there are for the parasite.  The more potential living spaces there are for the parasite, the better the reproductive prospects of the parasite.  So no, there is no "Darwinian" reason why a parasite would want to interfere with the reproductive prospects of the host.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just the opposite, in fact.  This is why the most successful parasites tend to be more innocuous.  Parasites that kill their host tend to be less successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Wright makes clear in the sentences that follow, he is getting confused about the definition of a parasite vs. a symbiont.  As he correctly states, a symbiont confers a reproductive advantage on the host, while a parasite does not.  This does not necessarily mean that the parasite confers a reproductive &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;advantage on the host.  Certainly many parasites do harm their hosts as a natural result of doing their business, but from a Darwinian perspective it behooves the parasite to minimize this damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So does the fact that there are a little over a billion Catholics in the world mean that it is unfair to refer to Catholicism as a "virus"?  Nope:  The number of people infected with HPV is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hpv#Prevalence"&gt;probably even higher&lt;/a&gt;.  And guess what, the V in HPV stands for "virus".  So no, the fact that a billion people are infected with the Catholic meme does not in any way mean we can't call it a virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in any case, even if we ignore this gaffe, the argument against Dennett he presents in that paragraph has all sorts of other problems.  First, as he admits, it is only &lt;i&gt;generally speaking&lt;/i&gt; that viruses are harmful to the host, so it is not fair to baldly assert that when Dennett refers to religion as a virus he must also be saying it is a parasite.  Second, Wright asserts that religion "manifestly helps people flourish" but doesn't give any evidence to back it up -- except I guess the number of Catholics in the world?  Well, then Wright must also believe that genital warts manifestly help people flourish, too, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most frustrating thing about all this is that if Wright wasn't so intent on being an asshole, he might have a good point.  If his thesis was that the "New Atheists" should be careful not to carry the issue too far, it might be a point well taken.  But instead he just wants to say the "New Atheists" aren't any good -- which is exactly the kind of intolerance that sparked this movement to begin with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-7402122881508387840?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248209478077"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/digging_at_the_finnestorp_war.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/87fa6377c692dfb0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Digging at the Finnestorp War Booty Sacrificial Site</title><published>2009-07-21T20:23:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T20:23:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/5JO8hU4ePkU/digging_at_the_finnestorp_war.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/digging_at_the_finnestorp_war.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.finnestorp.se/aktuellt.aspx#post-54"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/digging_at_finnestorp/Tva%20praktbleck%20in%20situ.JPG" width="345" height="177" alt="Tva praktbleck in situ.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style="font-size:80%"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sösdala style silver sheet fittings. Image from the Finnestorp project's web site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many things Swedish archaeologists envy our Danish neighbours are their splendid war booty sacrifices mainly of the 3rd, 4th and 5th centuries AD. These are silted-up lakes whose anaerobic peat deposits are full of vandalised military equipment taken from less fortunate invading armies (&lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/06/war-booty-sacrifices-and-princely.html"&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt;). In Sweden, we know of only two major sites in this category: Skedemosse on Öland, which was unfortunately drained and ploughed out long before archaeologists came to work there, and Finnestorp in Västergötland, which is still a shallow lake for part the year. I have just spent two happy days as a fieldworker on &lt;a href="http://www.finnestorp.se/"&gt;Bengt Nordqvist's dig at Finnestorp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site was discovered about 1903 when a road was built across the Katebrobäcken streamlet right by its confluence with River Lidan through a sizeable fen. Bones and pieces of fine metalwork were found and an excavation was mounted by Otto Frödin and Gustav Hallström. As is still the case today, it proved impossible to empty the Finnestorp fen of finds as it measures several hundred meters across. But the site was then largely forgotten. In the 1970s the road was rebuilt and moved slightly, and a new straight channel was dug for the lower reaches of Katebrobäcken. All this was done without archaeological supervision. Only after the fact could a small-scale fieldwork campaign be mounted by Ulf Erik Hagberg (who wrote the book on the aforementioned Skedemosse) and Eva Bergström. In 1992 Katebrobäcken's new channel was re-dug and deepened, again without the benefit of archaeological attention. Ulf Viking rushed to the site and did some fieldwork, but his project was tragically cut short by a lethal stroke. Bengt Nordqvist and the Gothenburg Historical Society began the current fieldwork campaign in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iron Age war booty at Finnestorp has spent most of the past 1600 years in a black smelly stratum full of leaves, sitting on top of the glacial clay and covered by thick silt. Most of the preserved objects are bronze and silver fittings for horse gear and swords. Spearheads and sword blades are few, shield bosses to my knowledge absent. There is an abundance of high-quality 5th century metalwork, much of it bronze strap mounts onto which gilded and punch ornamented silver-sheet decoration in the Sösdala style has been soldered. They appear to be thinly scattered all over the erstwhile lake floor with a few concentrations. The dates and quality of the objects are the same as those of the fabulous Danish Ejsbøl find, but the find density so far appears less high. Hearths have been found on an island in the fen which have yielded 5th century radiocarbon dates, sheep bones and molten silver droplets, evidence of feasting and systematic damage done to the war booty before sacrifice at these sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons that the on-going project has been able to collect so many fine things are that a) considerable parts of the find-bearing stratum have been lifted to the surface through the three main destructive digging events in the 20th century and deposited on top of the silt layer, b) the metal detector section within the Gothenburg Historical society (with which I have collaborated extensively in Östergötland) with their great skill have been on site for years searching through these dump layers. Most of the finds at Finnestorp are not made &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two days on site were spent in a 4 by 2 metre trench between the old and new channels of Katebrobäcken. At the top was a find-bearing layer resulting from the 1992 event. A few steps from the trench, this layer yielded a madly overdecorated bandolier buckle a few years ago, found by metal detector. Today Tim Olsson found a tiny bronze buckle for a Migration Period fanny pack (!) here while I shoveled the dump soil away for him in 10 cm increments. In adjoining parts of the trench, team members had also removed half a meter of dirt representing the 1970s event without finding anything before reaching the undisturbed find stratum containing a fine bronze sword pommel and two or three other things. Meanwhile Kenth Lärk followed the streamlet's erosion scarp with his metal detector and picked up a gorgeous strap joiner with a direct parallel in the Högom burial's bridle. He didn't have to shift an egg's volume of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large trench across the road, sited exclusively from study of the topography with a view to investigating the ancient lake's shore where the people behind the sacrifice would have stood, produced only a few small flint implements from several millennia before the sacrifices. This demanded a lot of hand-digging and sieving by many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Finnestorp offers a conundrum of fieldwork methodology. Ideally we would of course want to know where each ancient object is in the undisturbed parts of the black stratum. But find concentrations are few and far between in that layer, and reaching it is labour intensive. It is much more profitable to search by metal detector in the redeposited dumps on the surface, which is exactly what Bengt Nordqvist has the Gothenburg detectorists doing. The team's non-detectorists are collecting a small number of finds with exact original context info through digging and sieving. But the detectorists are raking in finds. They are from secondary positions, but are known to have moved only a few meters each in x-y-z direction when the road workers' mechanical excavator lifted them. Bengt Nordqvist's fieldwork campaign will thus prove one of the 21st century's greatest advances in Swedish Migration Period studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday evening I had the pleasure of talking for two hours without a script about my Östergötland project to an audience of ~50 in Trävattna parish hall. The place was packed, and as far as I could tell nobody fled during the intermission. I take this to mean that everybody enjoyed themselves almost as much as myself. At times like these I allow myself to think that it's actually a bit of a waste that (though not for lack of trying) I am not employed as a university teacher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/digging_at_the_finnestorp_war.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/5JO8hU4ePkU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248208843019"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_cartoon.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f10ec01594852434</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Television"/><title type="html">Jenny McCarthy and Oprah Winfrey: Cartoonists are starting to notice</title><published>2009-07-21T21:00:45Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T21:00:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/05ftWZrvLp0/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_cartoon.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_cartoon.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since Jenny McCarthy hitched her fading star to the anti-vaccine movement and managed to get Oprah Winfrey to go along for the ride, she has become the public face of the anti-vaccine movement. Unfortunately, there hasn't been nearly as much blowback as there should be in the mainstream press, although bloggers have been all over McCarthy's promotion of the worst lies of the anti-vaccine movement and advocacy of autism quackery. Then I came across this the other day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://comics.com/soup_to_nutz/2009-07-06/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/07/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_cartoon/286980.full.gif" width="500" height="157" alt="286980.full.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm of two minds on this. While it's a good thing to see cartoonists ridiculing Jenny McCarthy and Oprah for their promotion of anti-vaccine views, I can sympathize with &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2607"&gt;Sullivan when he writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many reasons I have for being vocal about my objections to Jenny McCarthy. Public health, that's obviously a big one. Making the rest of the world look at the "autism community" as a bit of a joke, well that's another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is perhaps the saddest thing about the anti-vaccine movement. Its sheer lunacy is unfairly and unjustly tainting the autism advocacy community by association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_cartoon.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/05ftWZrvLp0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248208187359"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2604">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45cf6866abb23681</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autism research funding: who is paying and how much?</title><published>2009-07-21T17:00:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T17:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/GRbiALFqC6E/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248208187359"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1759">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3dfffe7503861436</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Alternative Medicine: Weapons of Influence</title><published>2009-07-21T15:11:20Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T15:11:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/alternative-medicine-weapons-of-influence/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">In 2001, the fourth edition of a book titled Influence: Science and Practice written by Robert Cialdini was published.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/iss_complete.jpg" alt="The nearly-completed space station"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very disturbed to see &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/12/AR2009071201977.html?hpid=topnews"&gt;an article in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; claiming that a top NASA official was saying that the International Space Station might be purposely de-orbited as early as 2016!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shocked me. I am no fan of the ISS, and wish that money had been spent instead on a concerted effort to build a Moonbase — or almost anything else — but now that the money is spent it’s crazy to talk about dropping it into the Pacific just a few years after it’s built.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as it turns out, the date of 2016? Maybe not so much. &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/07/15/de-orbit-the-iss-in-2016-dont-bet-on-it/"&gt;Nancy Atkinson at Universe Today&lt;/a&gt; has the story. Basically, delays in completing the station may delay its eventual demise. However, it’s fair to note that NASA’s budget can fluctuate substantially, and is at the mercy of the whims of Congress. With even the Constellation program at risk — and Constellation has already been started up — it’s hard or even impossible to say where NASA will be in a half dozen years, or what it will be doing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248206588107"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-2056404488111109731">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10c5e57b41c9e2c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="death" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="christianity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Please do not read Romans 14:8 at my funeral</title><published>2009-07-21T19:02:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T19:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/please-do-not-read-romans-148-at-my.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Mariah and I went to a funeral this morning for one of her uncles.

(At least there was no bad music...)  Some of the Bible verses, I can understand why you would quote them at a funeral.  For instance, they read something from Song of Solomon about how when you die you don't actually die, but instead you are chastised for a little while and then go to some kind of paradise, mumble mumble.  It's a bit infantile, but I can see how it could be comforting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when we were coming in, the minister/pastor/whatever was reading this passage:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.&lt;br&gt;--&lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:8"&gt;Romans 14:8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uh, dude... Okay, so yeah, I know that many theists find the idea of "belonging to God" to be comforting, but I don't, and I don't really understand why they do.

In a strange turn of events, Chris Anderson &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free"&gt;got it all wrong&lt;/a&gt;, while Malcolm Gladwell &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/07/06/090706crbo_books_gladwell"&gt;got it right&lt;/a&gt;.  What's that?  Free.  Chris Anderson thinks it is the future of price; that companies should give their products away free and find other, magical ways to generate revenue.  Gladwell roundly criticizes this idea; it's worth reading his review because his critique is effective on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on...I want to make some crazy predictions here.  Free is dead.  It's a Ponzi scheme, and we're all invested in it.  We all love free, but it has a price.  We all think advertising will pay for everything, but in the end, something has to pay for advertising, and that something is in a recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscription was the model for media for a long time.  In the last century, advertising subsidized subscription, and in some markets, subsumed it.  In the 21st century, we're going to have to start paying for things again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you be willing to pay for sites such as the New York Times (as many people, myself include, do for the top-tier reporting of the Journal)?  Would the tradeoff be worthwhile if there were less advertisements?  What if, assuming that websites are wealth maximizing, these sites charge subscription fees, continue to advertise, and continue to sell users' information? Would you be willing to demand more from publications if you actually paid for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next crazy prediction: free is going to create a backlash similar to the anti-Wal-Mart movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/07/free_rip.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/q5z8TGpiq_Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248204539951"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ChildPyschologyAndParentingResearch/~3/LUgjLqZ-cpk/sleep-problems-in-preschool-children.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2773a0876364fac1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sleep problems in preschool children with and without developmental disorders: when parents and the actigraphs don’t agree.</title><published>2009-07-21T12:52:54Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T12:52:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/plfaLFF2IRQ/sleep-problems-in-preschool-children.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ChildPyschologyAndParentingResearch/~3/LUgjLqZ-cpk/sleep-problems-in-preschool-children.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I was just reading a study that examined the proposed pathways from sleep problems in preschool children to behavioral disruption during the day.

How can we place a value on education, on reason, on being properly informed? More importantly, if there was no monetary value on education and knowledge, would it have significance in our society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our fast-paced lives, surrounded by ever-speedier means to send and receive information, entertainment and knowledge, one question that I, as a content producer must grapple with is how much is this information worth to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has no doubt revolutionized the way modern societies access and consume information. Right behind information is entertainment.  With this paradigm shift is an important issue that people in the entertainment industry are facing, some gladly, others kicking and screaming. A few still have just buried their head in the sand (I submit that’s a start, they might as well keep digging into that sand)&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

You no doubt have heard of the strikes that have occurred in Hollywood with artists studios and agents all locking horns to determine rights, residuals and royalties. The Writer’s Guild of America strike lasted 100 days and is said to have cost up to 2.1 billion in opportunity costs. These talks included discussions about how rights and royalties would be paid for content that is streamed or downloaded through “New Media” sources, IE the Internet, mobile devices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much content do you personally consume on the internet?  How much of it if completely free to you, the end user? (Beside the cost for your bandwidth) I would guess that 90% or more is about right for most people.  Everyone says they still pay for music too!  ..That’s funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue that drives this home for me is the simple fact that I produce content.  I work hard on ideas, assemble groups of talented people and create videos, projects, movies, shows.  I do this with the intention of #1 Entertaining, #2 Educating, #3 Making a Living.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9311-01-225x149.jpg" alt="L to R Shira Lazar, Ryan Johnson &amp;amp; Brian Dunning in a creepy Meat Locker for Truth Hurts Web Series." title="IMG_9311-01" width="225" height="149"&gt;&lt;p&gt;L to R Shira Lazar, Ryan Johnson &amp;amp; Brian Dunning in a creepy Meat Locker for Truth Hurts Web Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In increasing levels of difficulty those three precepts make what I do for a living a challenge. It’s relatively easy to entertain someone (especially after you’ve been doing it for some time) It’s not as easy to educate someone; that becomes increasingly more subjective depending on your audience, and #3 making a living at it, is the toughest part most times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sit down at your computer, put on your iPod or turn on the radio, you’re presented with an almost unlimited number of options to entertain you and educate you.  So my question is this: What would you pay to get a program that is educational, and entertaining if it was centered around subjects related to Skepticism and critical thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My production team, Brian Dunning, Shira Lazar and I have recently completed the first episode of another skepticism-oriented project called Truth Hurts. We are developing this program as a web series that is accessible and viewed online.  These shorter (around 10 minute) entertaining, funny and educational shows will provide a great way to interject thinking with ideas, products and claims that are found in our daily lives. We screened a “director’s cut” during TAM7 in Las Vegas and got some great feedback for it. We are currently completing the edit and tightening it up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we plan the distribution and release of this series, we find ourselves engaged in the discussion that so many are grappling with right now: How do you monetize content on the Internet when you are surrounded by content that is free for the taking?  Advertising seems to be the way to go, and will most likely be the case for our program as well, (We are looking for sponsors currently) But there are other options, such as pay-per download and subscription based content. The way we stand out and offer a value is by placing a high importance on production quality, uniqueness of the content, and a fun show that is also educational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to make the content accessible to the widest audience available, and that means it’s got to be 100% free to view. So we need to have three things:  1. Advertisers that wish to align their brand with the types of people that would watch our show which, right now would mostly be our skeptical community, but would eventually shift to mainstream audiences and even to “believers” in the hocus that we slay. 2: People that are able to donate money directly to the project to support the type of content that we are creating. And 3: A energetic audience that tells their friends about the show and help it hopefully go “viral” so that it’s quickly consumed by the mainstream media audience. &lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/IMG_9360-01-225x337.jpg" alt="Truth Hurts Web Series Co-Hosts Shira Lazar and Brian Dunning" title="IMG_9360-01" width="225" height="337"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth Hurts Web Series Co-Hosts Shira Lazar and Brian Dunning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ask you, wonderful blog-reader bulldogs of critical thinking and punctuation, here’s a little questionnaire for you, would you help us with an impromptu marketing research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.What would YOU pay to watch an episode of a skeptical show on the Internet?&lt;br&gt;
2. Would you go to a specific website (IE: www.TruthHurts.tv) at least once a month to watch a new episode.&lt;br&gt;
3. Would you want to be able to download it?&lt;br&gt;
4. Would you sign up for a subscription service that electronically delivered the content to you for a monthly fee?&lt;br&gt;
5. Would you donate money directly to the production entity producing the content? (If so, look below!)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have plans in place and operations in motion to bring both The Skeptologists and TruthHurts to audiences soon, but having this information will help us to see how our little slice of web visitors to this site feel about these subjects. Your information and comments are very valuable to us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my dedicated team and I strive to create new and entertaining way of getting the concepts of Skepticism into the mainstream media, we’re working all the angles possible to bring these ideas to life! Your help and support is going a long way towards making that happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest case in point: A &lt;a href="http://blogs.chron.com/sciguy/archives/2009/07/post_101.html"&gt;review by science writer Eric Berger&lt;/a&gt; over at his excellent &lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; blog, SciGuy. Berger writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mooney and Kirshenbaum persuasively make a couple of points that have already proved unpopular in the burgeoning community of science bloggers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; New Atheism will not endear science to the 90 percent of Americans who believe in God, and &lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Science blogging may actually degrade American scientific culture, rather than revitalize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the atheism point, the book drew immediate criticism from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a popular New Atheism blog. While I am certainly sympathetic to the right of anyone to hold his or her own beliefs, what New Atheists ignore is that their shrillness gives all of science a very, very poor reputation in middle America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berger, of course, &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a science writer who writes for “middle America”–well, Houston, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, on blogging, I think the following point is the most salient from the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The single biggest blogging negative, however, is the grouping together of people who already agree about everything, and who then proceed to square and cube their agreements, becoming increasingly self-assured and intolerant of other viewpoints. Thus, blogging about science has brought out, in some cases, the loud, angry, nasty, and profanity-strewing minority of the science world that denounces the rest of America for its ignorance and superstition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree more. And this just doesn’t happen among scientists, of course. This trend toward echo-chamber communities on the Web really decreases the opportunities for meaningful dialogue among those who disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

There are days when I imagine that I'll run out of news reports of scientists caught behaving badly to blog about.  Then, I check my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, my inbox featured a &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/55823/"&gt;news item in &lt;em&gt;The Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about two medical researchers caught fabricating data:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/university_of_alabama_research.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/university_of_alabama_research.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/gn4coa6bY00" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248202399450"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_origins_of_the_evil_eye_an_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8bbaa16991433192</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">The Origins of the Evil Eye and Horticultural Fertility Cults?</title><published>2009-07-21T19:42:48Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T19:42:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/3Fa86C30dk4/the_origins_of_the_evil_eye_an_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_origins_of_the_evil_eye_an_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/images/rbicons/ResearchBlogging-Medium-White.png" width="80" height="50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It has become axiomatic that the use of adornment by humans is some sort of symbolic act, and thus is linked to the human symbolic and linguistic mind.  The human symbolic and linguistic mind is the trait that we axiomatically believe to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; derived human feature ... the cladistic apomorphy that makes us human (as opposed to other-ape).  Therefore, the use of adornment is seen by early 21st century archaeologists as evidence of modern human behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some artifacts from early archaeological sties might be adornment, or they might be 'art' (or at least "arty") and they might be related to ritual, and archaeologists will argue eternally over the meaning of lumps of red ochre or rocks with grooves or scratches in them.  But a manufactured bead is unambiguous. A roundish or even blob shaped pretty rock with a hole purposefully drilled through it is a bead, and even the most skeptical wet-blanket yielding taphonomist will accept that as an object of adornment, and thus the outcome of symbolic behavior, and thus evidence of the activities of a cultural and/or linguistic mind, and thus the presence at the time and place specified by the contextual analysis of the artifact of a con-specific.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel sorry for all those hominids who did not like beads and thus will never be part of the club.  I also feel sorry for the archaeologists who are going to read this and say "Hey, wait a minute, a bead &lt;em&gt;COULD&lt;/em&gt; be natural, how can you ever really be sure...?"  But that discussion is for another time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we want to ask:  What about the more specific behaviors, rituals, and beliefs that emerged &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the historical and geographical range of modern human-ness?  The paper at hand, by Dani Bar-Yosef Mayer and Naomi Porat, makes the bold assertion that the use of certain beads in West Asia is directly related to the beginning of ritual associated with the origins of agriculture, the use of objects to enhance 'fertility' (of humans, of the land) and to ward off the Evil Eye.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_origins_of_the_evil_eye_an_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_origins_of_the_evil_eye_an_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/3Fa86C30dk4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248202399449"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/blogospherics_36.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6b83335b9ebfdd3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospherics"/><title type="html">Blogospherics</title><published>2009-07-21T19:16:27Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T19:16:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/HfibYxzDLzs/blogospherics_36.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/blogospherics_36.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The whole "what is a giant squid really" question is &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/2009/07/squid-fail/"&gt;tackled once and for all by Dr. M on Deep Sea News. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I'd like to thank you for guarding the integrity of the swimming pool in my folks' neighborhood.  I know they feel safer because of you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that proud day twenty years ago, the day they handed you the thin cotton t-shirt with the banded collar and sleeves that reads "Pool Monitor", who could have known the proud years of service that would follow?  I know I couldn't have because I was in college writing a paper on The Authoritarian Personality (classic Adorno, you should read it). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your recent service is to be especially praised.  When my wife fell asleep in the sun by the pool, enjoying a brief moment of peace away from family, work and other worries, you made sure to check on her.  You made sure that a man she's never met came up to her, woke her up, and interrogated her, which, I'm sure, was for her own good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say though, that I'm a bit disturbed.  You asked her, as she rubbed her eyes and looked around to see if anyone else was nearby, her name, where she lived, what car she drove, whether she had kids---you asked all that but you forgot to ask her social security number.  I'm fairly certain you can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she asked to be left alone, when she was clearly nervous about a strange man approaching her and wagging a finger in her face, you made sure to reassure her of your status as an authority finger by standing over her, wagging your finger more vigorously, and showing her the now-tattered shirt that is your badge of office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure it was only a small oversight on your part that, when she could not get you to go away and had to make up a story about being pregnant, you didn't ask for a copy of the lab report, or better yet, take a look at her cervix.  Fred, I know you can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bad that I could not have been there to see your performance, as I would have had some specific words, and perhaps actions, in response to the service you performed, and while some might have considered these potential actions to be a bit of an over-reaction, I can assure you that they are less than you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Bravo! Fred.  Well done.  My wife now feels uncomfortable at my parents' pool, especially when alone.  Keep up the good work---it would make my day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/open_letter_to_abe_the_pool_na.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/YhmbLAgszUY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248200279805"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7191/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ec707851d1c8120</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Mystery of HIV Vaccine Failure Deepens</title><published>2009-07-21T13:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T13:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7191/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two groups of scientists have cast doubt on a leading explanation for the failure of a key HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx</id><title type="html">Science In The News Daily</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248200279804"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7190/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf7c06078206f7ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Space Agency Looks for Clearer Vision</title><published>2009-07-21T13:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T13:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7190/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For fans of space exploration, the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11's mission to the moon is a celebration mingled with melancholy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;

I have a hard time arguing with his point; last year carrying around my laptop everywhere destroyed my shoulder and back. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/30/comic-con-my-panel-on-science-and-scifi/"&gt;But it was worth it&lt;/a&gt;. Oh yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m totally chuffed about going again this year. In reality I have a lot of prep to do and I have to actually, y’know, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/06/comic-con-2009-now-with-more-science/"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; while I’m there. But sometimes my work can be pretty frakkin’ cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_mid.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The recent controversial &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/nyregion/30cars.html"&gt;shooting&lt;/a&gt; of an unarmed black man in New York has generated terrible grief and perhaps justifiable anger. But if officers honestly believed the man was armed and intended to harm them, weren't they justified in shooting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, but an important additional question is this: were they predisposed to believe he was armed simply because he was black? Consider this quick movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/upload/2006/11/plant1.mov"&gt;Click to play&lt;/a&gt; (QuickTime required)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will flash two pictures. One man is armed, the other unarmed. Who do you shoot? I've primed you to think about race, so it's not really a fair test. If you were a police officer who believed his life to be in danger, would you respond in the same way? (You can use the slider to see which man really was armed.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, a team led by J. Correll flashed random photos of white and black faces, some superimposed with guns, others with harmless items such as cell phones and wallets. They asked college students to press one key indicating "shoot" the suspect, and another indicating "don't shoot." The students were more likely to mistakenly fire at black faces that were unarmed compared to unarmed white faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about police officers? With their special training and rules about when to fire, perhaps they will do better. A study by E. Ashby Plant and B. Michelle Peruche tested police officers on a similar task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/07/shooting_unarmed_suspects_a_ma_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/07/shooting_unarmed_suspects_a_ma_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~4/LxAJp0zFr6g" height="1" width="1"&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself broke with the Southern Baptist Church 25 years ago when they began &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose"&gt;systematically persecuting Kevin Bacon&lt;/a&gt;.  So I am glad to (belatedly) welcome President Carter to the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I’m a bit disappointed that he remained silent on the equally-troubling Baptist practices of quoting carefully selected Bible verses to justify that “all Scripture is totally true and trustworthy,” that Jesus “was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary,” that Jesus “by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer,” that “it is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations,” that every Sunday “should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion,” that “Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly,” that “Christ will judge all men in righteousness,” that “the unrighteous will be consigned to Hell,” that “homosexuality is not a ‘valid alternative lifestyle,’” and that life begins “at the moment of conception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the Southern Baptist practice of &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1331390.html"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1325112.html"&gt;insipid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1327371.html"&gt;ghost-written&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1322376.html"&gt;syndicated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/255/story/1299283.html"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/article/20090706/no-church-is-perfect-but-don-t-give-up-your-search/index.html"&gt;columns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Elissa Hoffman, a blogging biology teacher, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Elissa Hoffman and I'm from Wisconsin. I'm a high school science teacher at Appleton East High School. Specifically, I teach biology and AP Biology. I have a BA in biology with minors in environmental studies and education, and when I was in college we divided biology majors into two categories - "big thing biologists" and "little thing biologists". I was definitely in the "big thing" group - I had a huge focus on aquatic ecology and spent many happy hours mucking through rivers, Secchi disks and phytoplankton sampling bottles in tow. My senior research project actually involved the feeding behaviors of Daphnia, which required me to do a lot of microvideotaping! Now that I'm teaching, though, my interests have broadened. I still love ecology, but I'm also really passionate about teaching evolution, genetics, botany, and anat/phys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Elissa Hoffman pic.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Elissa%20Hoffman%20pic.JPG" width="336" height="448" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a master's degree in Educational Leadership a few years ago, so I'm considering a move to school administration. However, given my penchant for setting goals, I'm currently looking at other options as well - debating the merits of various doctoral programs vs. getting another master's degree. At the moment, given school budget cuts, I'm pretty happy to be where I am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just love the ability to make connections with real people! Getting the chance to communicate directly with people who are doing actual scientific research or have cool science-related jobs is really, really invigorating.So often we in K-12 education are isolated from people who aren't part of our school network, and not being connected to current scientific research means that our students aren't hearing about it! I've had several guest bloggers on my class blog who have done a fabulous job of reminding my students that scientific research is still going on - that not all of the cool discoveries have already been made - and that researchers are real people who have social lives and fun personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="http://access.aasd.k12.wi.us/Staff/Hoffman/Wpress" title=""&gt;a class blog&lt;/a&gt; - I started it in January 2008 on a whim, thinking that since no one at my school was currently blogging with students I might as well try it out. After a few issues with making it work on our server, I unveiled it to the kids who were - well, unimpressed. Most of them had no idea what a blog was. When I talk about it with my new crop of students this fall, most of them STILL will have no idea what a blog is. But they catch on pretty quickly and I think they really like it! I've had them write posts, read posts, comment back and forth on each others' posts, and in general become comfortable with blogs and blog etiquette. I am thinking about using some guest bloggers again this year and anyone who's interested can email me (hoffmanelissa (at sign) aasd.k12.wi.us). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also got Twitter accounts (both personal and work-related) and a presence on Facebook. We do set up a class group on Facebook - the kids can join the group (i.e. "Mrs. Hoffman's AP Bio 2008-09", etc.) without having to "friend" me, which removes any ickiness or awkwardness. The group lets me distribute email messages to the kids really quickly and also lets me post links, photos, etc. that all of the kids can access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably sometime in 2007 - I really have no idea how I wandered into it. I do know that once ScienceBlogs picked up steam, it became a very exciting place to lurk! My RSS reader has a mixture of science blogs, health &amp;amp; medicine blogs, education blogs, and mommy blogs - there are an awful lot of favorites in there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't really pinpoint any one particular thing. It was a really great weekend - I was definitely not sure what to expect going into it, wondering if I was going to be in over my head with all of these uber-bloggers, but it worked out pretty well! I loved meeting everyone and having great conversations about science, blogging, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For too long people with autism have been misunderstood and discriminated against by a counter-productive system that often lets people reach crisis point before they get the help that they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May have come from someone in the UK (Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, to be exact), but it could have been said by someone in the US without any loss of relevance.  Here too, in the US too, "For too long people with autism have been misunderstood and discriminated against by a counter-productive system that often lets people reach crisis point before they get the help that they need."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big difference however is that the quote is being made in the context of a &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153281.php"&gt;government audit&lt;/a&gt; that found that providing non-crisis services for individuals on the spectrum could save the country millions.  The quote continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a huge shortfall in social care funding which urgently needs to be addressed and it's absolutely crucial that reform is not at the expense of those who may need a lifetime of support. People with lifelong conditions, such as autism, may be less able to save and pay for their social care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If the Government are serious about giving people with autism the same rights and opportunities as everyone else we must have a system that is both fair and affordable for all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As autism policy in the US continues to fixate primarily around a narrow range of interventions for small children, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/division_again_but_of_a_different_sort"&gt;separate itself from larger disability issues&lt;/a&gt; (including lessons already learned), and ignore the concept of long term supports and services &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_baffling_case_of_the_vanishing_civil_rights"&gt;in the national agenda&lt;/a&gt;, the future for most of us in the states is not seeming so shiny.

&lt;p&gt;PLoS has recently published a highly speculative but very interesting paper on how a particular signaling pathway, the &lt;i&gt;Hedgehog&lt;/i&gt; pathway, might have evolved. It&amp;#39;s at a fairly early stage in hypothesis testing, which is one of the things that makes it interesting — usually all you see published is the product of a great deal of data collection and experiment and testing, which means the scientific literature gives a somewhat skewed view of the process of science, letting the outsider mainly see work that has been hammered and polished, while hiding the rougher drafts that would better allow us to see how the story started and was built. It&amp;#39;s informative in particular for those who follow the creationist “literature”, which often crudely apes the products of actual working science, but lacks the sound methodological underpinnings. In particular, creationism completely misses the process of poking at the real world to develop ideas, since they begin with their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take this description as a work in progress — we&amp;#39;re seeing the dynamic of building up a good working model. As usual, it starts on a sound foundation of confirmed, known evidence, makes a reasonably hypothesis on the basis of the facts, and then proposes a series of research avenues with predicted results that would confirm the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been especially interesting to read the types of things people write on other blogs about me.  Most of the recent stuff I can&amp;#39;t take seriously -- especially when it comes from a commentariat where use of the word &amp;quot;nigger&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fag&amp;quot; is acceptable.  It&amp;#39;s usually the same crap I&amp;#39;ve been getting as long as I&amp;#39;ve been Isis: &amp;quot;Isis posts too many shoes and not enough science.&amp;quot;  But that is the nature of the interwebz and it has been an enlightening experience. Perhaps one day we&amp;#39;ll have a chat about why I think post-graduate, early career scientists   don&amp;#39;t blog more about science.  Maybe.  Or, maybe I am being a bit like a cat and I am going to lose interest as soon as the next shiny thing comes into view.  I can guarantee nothing these days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2009/07/15/funny-pictures-i-ownz-that-too/"&gt;&lt;img title="funny-pictures-cat-plays-monopoly" src="http://icanhascheezburger.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/funny-pictures-cat-plays-monopoly.jpg" alt="funny pictures of cats with captions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the comments though has given me pause to stop and reflect...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I tell you all frequently how busy I am and that is annoying.  Hm.  I suppose it just might be.  I try to tell you all things about my life because I find myself fascinating and highly entertaining, but hearing this criticism reminded me of a time when I once levied it myself and made me think about the kind of scientist I have become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in graduate school I worked for a fairly well-known scientist who had achieved substantial seniority at our university.  Going into the program I knew that this would offer me a number of advantages.  It did and, for better or worse, I wouldn't change my graduate school experience.  But, one of the things that regularly irked me was just how busy this guy was.  We had scheduled to meet privately every two weeks on Tuesdays at 2pm and I would frequently go to his office to find a Post-It note on the door saying things like "Running late.  See you at 3pm." Or, "Last minute obligation.  Gone for the day."  Or, occasionally, I would show up and wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  He might show up sometime later, but always with the same excuse.  "I'm sorry, Isis.  I was busy and this was the soonest I could get here."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to really frustrate me.  I mean &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;.  It made me wonder if my work (or, heaven forbid &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;me personally&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) was really important to him.  I remember crying over it a couple of times early in graduate school, rationalizing to myself that, if he really cared, he would make it a priority to be there for our meetings. I remember swearing to myself that I would never do that to a student.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem?  I now do it all the damned time.  I did it yesterday to a student who came to me wanting help with something and I told him there was no way I could help him until after Friday at 2 pm because I was too busy, and that I thought he had enough information to figure it out himself.  I know it frustrated him because I probably could have solved the problem that afternoon.  Friday at 2 pm is the internal deadline for this grant, and that is my livelihood.  It helps determine my promotion and my future ability to do science.   It should be my immediate priority, no?  Part of me feels apologetic because I know that this student had a moment where he felt like he was not a priority to me.  Part of me knows how it feels to then entertain the thought that someone doesn&amp;#39;t care about your needs or your success. Part of me feels like this is just the way the game is played, Buttercup, and we all need to toughen up a bit.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;But, I'll still talk to him...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had moments chatting with friends who are parents where we realize that we have become more like our parents than we ever would have wanted.  I realize that I have become my scientific father (except hotter and with much better hair), fueled in part by the fact that it is logistically impossible to be everything to everyone at every moment in this field and sometimes one must learn to say, &amp;quot;You are not my priority right now.&amp;quot;  There is no way that I can be equally scientist, mother, wife, mentor, kick ass blog diva, teacher, every moment of every day to  every person and I realize that sometimes I am going to say, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t do X because Y is a bigger priority.&amp;quot;  Maybe it is annoying if you are the one with the expectation of X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have moved on from graduate school and accepted this as my reality, what I need to get over professionally is apologizing for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/academic_standard_time_and_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/fB-GOF_yPbA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248195556951"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-8259816817650042652">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8f321746a0159cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The PZ Effect (He's no Slashdot...)</title><published>2009-07-21T16:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T16:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/pz-effect-hes-no-slashdot.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">It turns out that a friend of mine whose &lt;a href="http://blog.hoopycat.com/index.php"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; I have in my blogroll is really obsessive about tracking his server usage, and when I started to get Pharyngulian hits the other day it manifested itself by a huge spike in fetches of his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon"&gt;favicon&lt;/a&gt;.

(I'm not going to name names; you know who you are.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to offer these friends (and others in this situation) encouragement to &lt;strong&gt;get that dissertation written&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know, you have your reasons for not finishing.  Yes, I know writing a dissertation can feel like the hardest thing ever -- I wrote two of them, so I have a bit of experience here.  Believe me, I know that the writing of a dissertation often takes place against the backdrop of intense psychological obstacles and insane demands on your time; I wrote my first one while experiencing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/02/changing_sidesforsaking_scienc.php"&gt;a major crisis&lt;/a&gt; about what I wanted to be when I grew up, while the second only had to compete with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/07/having_a_family_and_an_academi_2.php"&gt;care of an infant&lt;/a&gt;, a full teaching load, and an exhausting daily commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need me to give you reasons not to write that dissertation, else it would be written.  So, from the other side of that dark tunnel, let me give you some reasons to do it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/twelve_reasons_to_finish_writi.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/twelve_reasons_to_finish_writi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/-zFVHab0tfU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248190184298"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/oh_no_ill_never_be_able_to_moc.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cddd45a8ae8b72d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Oh, no!

One of the staple sources of creationist lunacy I document here has always been Texas (with Florida as a close runner-up), which seems to be thickly infested with ignoramuses who get elected to high office. It's the kind of place that inspires the Molly Ivins of the world. Lately, we've been appalled at the idiots the Texas government wants to put in charge of science education, but there's another victim in the gunsights, too: history and social studies. The same abysmal talents that can muck up biology also want to turn social studies into patriotic mulch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, they can't get crazy enough in Texas, apparently, so the local ideologues had to go looking for greater loons, a national search for loons when the homegrown flavor just isn't piquant enough. And where does he go shopping?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/when-genius-passes-you-by/"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, the shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don McLeroy wanted to bring in &lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/05/23/mcleroy-backs-fringe-expert-for-social-studies/"&gt;Alan Quist&lt;/a&gt; to join their social studies team. Quist is a former wanna-be governor of Minnesota (who got clobbered in a landslide defeat) with minimal education qualifications. He has a bachelor's in psychology and a masters in speech; he teaches (minimally) at a local bible college, and most damningly, his wife runs &lt;a href="http://www.edwatch.org/"&gt;EdWatch&lt;/a&gt;, one of those awful anti-education advocacy sites that promotes the destruction of public schools so everyone can go off and be homeschooled. His pet obsessions are the usual, gays and abortions. He's ag'in 'em both. He will rant for food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an idea of the quality of his mind, you should read his &lt;a href="http://www.edwatch.org/updates09/071709-mapsw.htm"&gt;disproof of global warming&lt;/a&gt;. He builds on an old map, the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mom/oronteus.html"&gt;Oronteus Finaeus map of 1532&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the outlines of a southern continent, Antarctica (with many of the details wrong). From this, he draws the conclusion that Antarctica had been thoroughly explored in the 16th century, that it had been free of ice with flowing rivers, and therefore, the world had been much, much warmer than it is now 500 years ago, and &lt;i&gt;therefore&lt;/i&gt;, global warming is a myth. The ice sheet in Antarctica is only half a millennium old, which discovery would rather radically mess up our understanding of climatology, geology, and physics…pretty impressive for a know-nothing wingnut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/oh_no_ill_never_be_able_to_moc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/IiqOAK_dmkA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248189891589"><id gr:original-id="http://brainblogger.com/2009/07/21/neglecting-unilateral-neglect/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1c49804a7f54fbdc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Neglecting Unilateral Neglect</title><published>2009-07-21T09:00:15Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T09:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/zAxjIFz_HZY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/07/21/neglecting-unilateral-neglect/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Unilateral neglect (UN) is a debilitating cognitive deficit following traumatic brain injury with long-term implications to both the person affected and the health care system.

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at school, I signed up for a class that was listed as “Religion in Culture”.  I thought it would be an interesting overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the grad student teaching the class had other, more specific ideas, and the class ended up as “Evangelism and Sports”.  It was interesting, and I’ve been dying to use the “sports” tag ever since I started writing on Friendly Atheist.  And I finally found an excuse: this clever lesson from &lt;strong&gt;Dante Shepherd’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://survivingtheworld.net/Lesson142.html"&gt;Surviving the World&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I know religion is notoriously difficult to define, but I still maintain that categorizing say, football, as religion is silly.  Yes, you meet on Sunday, participate in group chants, and have odd rules enforced by men in strange outfits.  But without a belief in the supernatural, I don’t think it should be considered ‘religious’.&lt;/p&gt;

The phenomenon is by no means unknown, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/XkcdQwertialAphasia.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/XkcdQwertialAphasia.png" alt="" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, &lt;em&gt;qwertial&lt;/em&gt; is a cute derivative from &lt;em&gt;QWERTY&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to John Riemann Soong.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[Addenda 7/22/09: I now realize that &lt;em&gt;qwertial&lt;/em&gt; is also not really appropriate; the intrusive elements aren't single letters, but whole expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a message from Bruce Rusk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your post on LL today says of the accidental inclusion of spoken words in writing that “The phenomenon is by no means unknown, however.” Certainly true: a parable recounted by the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;-century BCE Chinese thinker Han Fei tells of a man who was writing at night and told the servant holding the light to “raise the lamp.” As he did so he accidentally inserted the words “raise the lamp” into his letter, setting off a chain of events of which Han Fei makes a great deal. So the phenomenon has probably been around as long as writing (or at least easy writing with pen or brush).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a note on aphasia. Sometimes when I cite ordinary-life examples of glitches of one kind or another, people identify them as aphasic, explaining that they&amp;#39;re just the sort of thing you hear (or read) from aphasics. This is true, but in an important sense it has the relationship backwards. There are all sorts of everyday speech errors, and they aren&amp;#39;t symptoms of pathology. Instead, in aphasias and other language pathologies, errors occur much more frequently and in greater profusion (making speech and writing often very hard to understand) — but with rare exceptions, the errors in language pathologies are of the same sort as everyday errors.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248186728712"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1684">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9583d47fc3cd80bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">Survey shows Canadian firms continue to innovate</title><published>2009-07-21T13:21:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T13:21:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/survey-shows-canadian-firms-continue-to-innovate/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">In contrast to recent reports lamenting the lack of Canadian corporate innovation, a new American Express survey reported in the Financial Post suggests Canadian business owners are embracing the recession as an opportunity to step up investments in innovation.

Kucera credits her scientific fascination to her parents who first introduced her to the observation, exploration and study of living things in their natural habitats. She graduated from British Columbia’s Simon Fraser University in 2004 with a B.Sc. in Biology. As a Master’s student at the University of New Brunswick in the fall of 2004, Kucera began her research in Dr. Gary Saunders’ lab studying the diversity of marine intertidal seaweeds of Canada using variation in DNA barcode sequences. Kucera subsequently transferred to the PhD program, where she is currently finishing the “last bits of lab work” to complete her PhD....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I have the usual sort of debunking in it, but I made a point I had not seen anywhere else at that time: why don’t astronomers see relatively more UFOs than laypeople?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it. Astronomers, both amateur and professional, are constantly viewing the sky. There are tens of thousands of amateurs out observing all the time: a large sample population, and far larger in observing man-hours than the regular population. If UFOs are so common, then why do we not see an unusually large number of reports from astronomers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assertion is that this is because the vast majority of UFO reports from people are misidentified objects like Venus, the Moon, satellites, balloons, and so on. These are things every amateur astronomer has seen countless times, and knows are not alien spaceships bent on probing the backsides of rural citizens. While this does not mean every single observed object is something more mundane, it does mean that the huge numbers quoted by UFOlogists are most certainly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I published the book, I got lots of criticism from the UFO culture who, predictably, couldn’t parse my very simple logic. I got some amusement from it, I’ll admit, since trying to reason with some people is clearly a losing game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why bring all this up now? Because amateur astronomer Tim Printy has published an article about this in his online magazine &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty/UFO/SUNlite.htm"&gt;Skeptical UFO Newsletter lite (SUNlite)&lt;/a&gt; — you can download the issue directly &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty/UFO/SUNlite1_2.pdf"&gt;here (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. He does an excellent job rebutting the usual silly claims of the UFO crowd when they froth and rail about my statement. He picks their arguments apart point-by-point, showing just why my claims are accurate and theirs are not. It’s a good read… and I’m not saying that because he supports me. I’m saying that &lt;em&gt;because he’s right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers may remember Tim’s &lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~tprinty/UFO/AZUFO.htm"&gt;excellent debunking of the Phoenix Lights&lt;/a&gt; as well, which &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/03/23/phoenix-lights-again/"&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; on the tenth anniversary of that particular silliness. I think I’ll keep my eye on him. Another skeptical astronomer is most welcome!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248185819873"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14030">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/194797355f8892a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">The Power of De-Baptisms</title><published>2009-07-21T14:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T14:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/21/the-power-of-de-baptisms/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I mentioned an article about &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/20/atheist-communities-growing/"&gt;atheist communities&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporter, &lt;strong&gt;G. Jeffrey MacDonald&lt;/strong&gt;, has also written a side piece about &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/news/2009/07/atheists-choose-de-baptism-to.php"&gt;atheist “de-baptism ceremonies.”&lt;/a&gt;  (I’m mentioned in it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is made of the notion that the atheist de-baptisms “mock” Christians — that’s not really what they’re about.  For some participants, it’s a way to put some closure on that chapter of your life, by leaving the church the same way you entered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For [Jennifer] Gray, the lighthearted spirit of last summer’s Atheist Coming Out Party and De-Baptism Bash in suburban Westerville, Ohio, served a higher purpose than merely spoofing a Christian rite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was very therapeutic,” Gray said in an interview. “It was a chance to laugh at the silly things I used to believe as a child. It helped me admit that it was OK to think the way I think and to not have any religious beliefs.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacDonald notes that the ceremonies are an American practice, while &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; getting de-baptized, and getting your name off church rosters, is a European phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
De-baptism efforts have been growing internationally in recent years. More than 100,000 Britons downloaded de-baptism certificates from the National Secular Society (NSS) between 2005 and 2009, according to NSS campaigner Stephen Evans. Upwards of 1,000 Italians requested de-baptism certificates prior to Italy’s “De-Baptism Day” last October, according to Italy’s Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the article has to include comments from Christians who take these things seriously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For mainline Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox Christians, baptism is commonly understood as a sign or means of grace and a covenant that God maintains even when humans turn away, said Laurence Stookey, professor emeritus of preaching and worship at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington. &lt;strong&gt;He said “de-baptizers” misunderstand baptism when they caricature it as an attempt at magic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptism “is a kind of adoption where you become a child of God, of the church and of the family,” Stookey said. “You can renounce your physical parents, (the church and God), but they cannot renounce you because you are their child. &lt;strong&gt;Anybody who makes fun of baptism probably hasn’t gone into it in enough depth to know that.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheists understand that concept perfectly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s precisely &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we leave the church and “mock” these silly beliefs.  Becoming a “child of God” sounds nice rhetorically, but getting dunked in a baptismal pool has no more effect on you than belly-flopping into your neighbor’s swimming pool.  Any change is occurring only in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else find it absurd that some of these Christians will oppose pharmacists giving Plan B to underage girls because “they’re not old enough to understand what they’re doing”… and then baptize babies before they can even form memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baptisms are symbolic for Christians, even if they think there’s more going on.  De-baptisms are symbolic for atheists, too, except we know there’s no “magic” happening with that blow dryer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's not too much of an exaggeration when I wonder if they think that the Lizard Men have taken over the government, the CDC, and the American Academy of Pediatrics in order to use vaccines in a New World Order plot to make all of our children autistic. Or something. I'm never quite sure. Knowing this particular aspect of the anti-vaccine movement, the only thing that surprises me is that they haven't joined the forces arrayed against President Obama's effort to reform health care in this country. While there may be principled and reasonable objections to elements of the plan or even philosophical objections to the very concept of the government funding health care, this rant is none of those. Written by Terrence P. Jeffry and entitled &lt;a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=51115" rel="nofollow"&gt;Health Care Bill Will Fund State Vaccine Teams to Conduct 'Interventions' in Private Homes&lt;/a&gt;, it has that lovely "Oh, noes, Obama's coming to steal our babiez" sort of vibe that, even though I know I should, I just can't resist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNSNews.com) -&lt;/strong&gt; There is a knock at the front door. Peeking through the window, a mother sees a man and a woman, both in uniform. They are agents of health-care reform.
 
"Excuse me, ma'am," says the man. "Our records show that your eleven-year-old daughter has not been immunized for genital warts."
 
"And your four-year-old still needs the chicken-pox vaccine," says the woman.
 
"He will not be allowed to start kindergarten unless he gets that shot, you know," says the man--smiling from ear to ear. 
 
"So, can we please come in?" asks the woman. "We have the vaccines right here," she says, lifting up a black medical bag. "We can give your kids the shots right now."
 
"We are from the government," says the man, "and we're here to help."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oooh. Scary! Run!

It's so familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, he goes completely bald.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, he gets a monocle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dueling scar would be a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to complete his transformation to the dark side, he gets a cat. Persian. A cat whose cold, expressionless stare reflects the imperious, implacable privilege of his nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know, he's posing in front of death rays and sending ultimata to world leaders. I hope he's been working on his evil laugh; if he's got a girlish giggle or some kind of nasal snicker this just isn't going to work, and he'll have to settle for a position as an Igor somewhere. It's still a good gig, of course, so I encourage you all to go over there and help him on his way down this career path.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;P.S. As long as he's shaving, that carpet on his chest has to go, too. Hirsute is for henchmen; masterminds have to be fully depilated.

In the audience were, among others, Hastings director Tom Murray and &lt;a href="http://www.johnhorgan.org/"&gt;John Horgan&lt;/a&gt; of the Stevens Institute of Technology. There seem to be some slight disagreements between John &amp;amp; myself–he tilts somewhat more “New Atheist,” though we’re both atheists–so we’re thinking about taking it to bloggingheads to sort it out….in a civil way, of course.

Consequently my family pride is something inconceivable.&amp;#39; Inconceivable and probably misplaced, it would seem. The character is named, more appropriately even than Gilbert could have imagined, Pooh-Bah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;As you'll see if you read the editorial and the articles it references, the analogies between the evolution of species and of languages are closer than Charles Darwin knew when he first suggested the metaphor. Like languages, species exhibit the borrowing of traits ("horizontal gene transfer"), and also areal features ("false vertical signals reflecting preferential gene transfer between bacterial species from quite separate branches of the phylogenetic tree and that happen to share a habitat").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difference: horizontal gene transfer, as I understand it, is much less common as you look higher up in the evolutionary tree of species. (Though I guess there are some theories according to which rates and even types of linguistic "horizontal transfer" might have been strikingly different in different historical periods.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the cooperative kittens,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Sleeping kittens are invoked to explain the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for cooperative binding of oxygen by hemoglobin, in which it is assumed that oxygen binding to one subunit has no effect on the affinity of the other subunits for oxygen, but that the conformational changes that increase or decrease oxygen affinity occur in unison. Readers who find the behavior of kittens easier to understand than the behavior of molecules may be encouraged by the analogy to read the non-kitten paragraphs too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are linguistic analogies here as well, but I'll leave those for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248181170710"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3317">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/054436cc0722530f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Chris Mooney on NSF funding</title><published>2009-07-21T12:47:36Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T12:47:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/chris-mooney-on-nsf-funding/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;The Intersection&lt;/em&gt;, Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum have been &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/20/40-years-after-the-moon-landings-americas-science-deficit/"&gt;writing up a storm&lt;/a&gt; of pieces to publicize their book, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;.  The latest is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-mooney/the-american-science-defi_b_241063.html"&gt;a piece in Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; by Mooney that, as did the book, laments the loss of interest and activity in science since the beefing-up of American research in response to the Russian launch of Sputnik in 1957.  The HuffPo piece says this (my emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched by President Kennedy, the Apollo program was just the most prominent example of America’s dramatic investment of science in the wake of the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik. The first Earth-orbiting satellite, beeping at us from above, inspired stark competitive fears in the nation: Were we falling behind in technology? Would the Soviets fire on us from the skies, and if they tried, could we stop them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n response, the U.S. Congress jacked up the budget of the recently formed National Science Foundation to $134 million, an increase of nearly $100 million in just one year. And that was just the beginning — NSF’s budget continued to explode in subsequent years, so that by 1962-1963 it had reached $12.2 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Meanwhile, Congress created NASA and passed the National Defense Education Act, providing generous funding to encourage American students to pursue careers in science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read this, I thought, “Whoa! That’s a huge increase.” From about 34 million to 12.2 billion is, in fact, nearly a &lt;em&gt;350-fold increase&lt;/em&gt; in half a decade.  That didn’t look right, especially when you know that the NSF budget for 2009 is about 6 billion dollars. Was it really twice as large 36 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out it wasn’t.  A brief trawl of the NSF home page yielded this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="NSF Complete budget history current dollars" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/nsf-complete-budget-history-current-dollars1.gif?w=411&amp;amp;h=283" alt="NSF Complete budget history current dollars" width="411" height="283"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though the NSF budget in 1962-1963 was between 300 and 400 million dollars: only about 2-3% of the figure Mooney cites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course the dollar has decreased in real terms over the years, so I looked up the NSF yearly budget in constant 2003 dollars (the only figures I could find). It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="NSF constant 2003 dollars" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/nsf-constant-2003-dollars.gif?w=416&amp;amp;h=289" alt="NSF constant 2003 dollars" width="416" height="289"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some stagnation in the late ’60s and ’70s, then, the NSF budget appears to have grown in real terms up to the latest figures from 2003.   The amount of real money given to the NSF is way, way larger now (well, at least up to 2003) than it was in 1957.  There’s no indication that we’re funding science at a lower level now than we were after Sputnik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did Mooney get that 12.2-billion-dollar figure?  I think it comes from the total amount of money spent on R&amp;amp;D by the federal government, which as 10.3 billion dollars in 1962 and 12.5 billion dollars in 1963.  But that is not the same thing as the NSF budget. In 1963, for example, 7.8 billion of that 12.5 billion dollars went to national defense, and a further 2.8 billion to space research and technology.  Only 626 million went to “health,” and 246 million to “general science.” Comparing an NSF budget in 1958 to the total R&amp;amp;D budget in 1962-1963 is comparing apples and oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was almost certainly an honest mistake by Mooney.  All of us screw up: the first printing of my book, for example, contained a couple of erroneous figures. But this mistake bears correcting in HuffPo, for, in light of the data above, there doesn’t seem to be a real slowdown in NSF funding compared to 1957, and no indication that there was a post-Sputnik “golden age of science” that has now vanished. In other words, I don’t see much evidence for this assertion by Mooney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, the policies and cultural changes unleashed in the wake of Sputnik shaped the course of American science for decades — and made us world leaders. But then, something went very wrong. Science budgets stopped rising and began to fall. Educational investment also declined. Science became ensnared with politics, first the foe of the religious right, then something to be spiked at will by the Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, our culture changed vastly since the mid-twentieth century. Science became much less cool, scientists ceased to be role models, and kids aren’t rushing home anymore to fire rockets from their backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe science isn’t cool any longer (I don’t see that anyway, since model rockets have given way to dinosaurs), but it doesn’t seem to be reflected by a decline in federal budgets, in either constant or real dollars. (The NIH budget shows &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/appropriations/index.htm"&gt;a substantial growth over time&lt;/a&gt; as well: the National Institute of General Medical Science, for example, which funds me, got 160 million dollars in 1968 and 1.95 billion dollars in 2008, roughly a twofold increase in real dollars using the consumer price index).&lt;/p&gt;

Most people think they're better looking than average, more intelligent, better at driving and less likely to get ill. Psychologists seeking to explain this common delusion have suggested it serves a protective role: a shield against the depressing realities of fate, fallibility and social spite. However, a surprising new study by &lt;a href="http://www.sanderthomaes.com/"&gt;Sander Thomaes&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues directly contradicts this account. Their investigation with older children suggests that a realistic self view is more protective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two hundred and six children aged between nine and twelve years rated how much they liked each of their classmates and how much they thought each of their classmates liked them. This gave the researchers a measure of how realistic each child's self-view was. Two weeks later, the children were invited to play a "Survivor Game" - a kind of internet popularity contest in which the least popular of four players would be voted out of the group. The game was fixed and half the children were told that they were the least popular. The other children received neutral feedback: another child had been voted out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using a measure of mood before and after the game, the researchers found that children with a more realistic view of their popularity at school were the least badly affected by rejection in the Survivor Game. By contrast, children with an inflated view of their popularity, or a deflated view, experienced a far greater drop in their mood after being told they'd been voted out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our results suggest that vulnerable children holding positively or negatively distorted self-views may benefit from interventions that target their biased social-reasoning processes," Thomaes and his colleagues concluded.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Psychological+Science&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2009.02395.x&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Reality+Bites-or+Does+It%3F+Realistic+Self-Views+Buffer+Negative+Mood+Following+Social+Threat&amp;amp;rft.issn=09567976&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fblackwell-synergy.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2009.02395.x&amp;amp;rft.au=Thomaes%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Reijntjes%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Orobio+de+Castro%2C+B.&amp;amp;rft.au=Bushman%2C+B.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology"&gt;Thomaes, S., Reijntjes, A., Orobio de Castro, B., &amp;amp; Bushman, B.

&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I reviewed the first half of my lecture at TAM 7 (The Amazing Meeting 7) on rising above traditional left-right politics. The second half of my lecture was based on my belief that in order for our species to survive we need to make the transition to a Type I civilization. This visage of our future is based on some work I did last year, that resulted in an opinion editorial in the Los Angeles Times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our civilization is fast approaching a tipping point whereby we will need to make the transition from nonrenewable fossil fuels as the primary source of our energy to renewable energy sources that will allow us to flourish indefinitely into the future. Failure to make that transformation will doom us to the endless political machinations and economic conflicts that have plagued our civilization for the past half millennium. We need new technologies, but without new politics and economics we cannot make the transition. The transition to what? To a Type I civilization. Let me explain.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 1964 article on searching for extra-terrestrial civilizations, the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev suggested using radio telescopes to detect energy signals from other solar systems in which there might be three different types of civilization: Type I can harness all of the energy of its home planet, Type II can harvest all of the power of its sun, and Type III can master the energy from its entire galaxy. Based on our energy efficiency at the time, in 1973 the astronomer Carl Sagan estimated that we are a Type 0.70 civilization. Current estimates put us at 0.72. As the Kardashevian scale is logarithmic — where each increase in power consumption requires a huge leap in production — we have a ways to go to make the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil fuels won’t get us there. Renewable sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal are a good start, and coupled to nuclear power could eventually get us there, once the technologies are developed. But the problem is not just a technological one. We have a proven track record of remarkable technological solutions to survival problems, as long as the political will and economic opportunities allow them to flourish. We need a Type I polity and economy, along with the technology, in order to become a Type I civilization. What is a Type I polity and economy? Global democracy and capitalism. We are close. Consider how far we’ve come in the long history of our species from Type 0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.1: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fusion-fission&lt;/em&gt; groups of hominids living in Africa, where group membership is fluid, technology consists of primitive stone tools, within-group conflicts are resolved through dominance hierarchy, and between-group violence is common.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.2: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bands&lt;/em&gt; of roaming hunter-gatherers who are related to one another as a kinship group, with a mostly horizontal political system and an egalitarian economy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.3: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tribes&lt;/em&gt; of individuals linked together through kinship but with a more settled and agrarian lifestyle than bands, with the beginnings of a political hierarchy and a primitive economic division of labor.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.4: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chiefdoms&lt;/em&gt; consisting of a coalition of tribes into a single hierarchical political unit with a chief or big man at the top and with the beginnings of significant economic inequalities and a division of labor in which lower class members produce food and other products consumed by nonproducing upper class members.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.5: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;States&lt;/em&gt; as a political coalition with jurisdiction over a well-defined geographical territory with its corresponding inhabitants over which it rules, with a mercantile economy that seeks a favorable balance of trade in a win-lose game against other states.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.6: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Empires&lt;/em&gt; as states that extend their control over peoples who are not culturally, ethnically, or geographically within its normal jurisdiction, with a goal of economic dominance over other empires through colonies.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.7: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Democracies&lt;/em&gt; that divide the sources of power over several institutions that are run by elected officials voted for by some citizens, with the beginnings of a market economy.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.8: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liberal democracies and free markets&lt;/em&gt; that gave the vote to all citizens and began to embrace a nonzero win-win economic game through free trade with other states.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 0.9: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Democratic-Capitalism&lt;/em&gt;, now spreading across the globe through democratic movements and free trade agreements.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Type 1.0: &lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Globalism&lt;/em&gt; that includes worldwide wireless internet access, all knowledge digitized and available to everyone anywhere any time, a global economy with complete open economic borders and free markets where anyone can trade with anyone else without interference from states or governments, and where all states are democracies in which everyone on the planet has the franchise. &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forces at work that could prevent us from making the Great Leap Forward to a Type I civilization are primarily political and economic. The resistance by non-democratic states to turning power over to the people is considerable, especially in theocracies whose leaders would prefer we all revert to Type 0.4 chiefdom status. The opposition toward a global economy is substantial, even in the Industrial West, where economic tribalism still dominates the thinking of most politicians, intellectuals, and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years we lived in a zero-sum tribal world where the gain of one tribe, state, or nation meant the loss of another tribe, state, or nation, and our political and economic systems have been designed to live in that win-lose world. But now we have the opportunity to live in a win-win world and become a Type I civilization by spreading liberal democracy and free trade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am optimistic because in the evolutionist’s deep time and the historian’s long view, the trend-lines toward achieving Type I status are inexorably upward. That is change we can believe in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, alas, they were defeated by a large margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/14/ffrf-sues-over-in-god-we-trust-at-capitol-visitor-center/"&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is suing to prevent the engraving — which I’m not optimistic about, but I wish them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=104477"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuck Norris&lt;/strong&gt;, however, is pissed off.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m a fighter for the freedoms of speech and religion. They are our constitutional rights — what the First Amendment is all about. But those freedoms don’t give atheists the entitlement to eliminate or revise America’s religious heritage in the new $621 million taxpayer-provided Capitol Visitors Center, or CVC, in Washington, D.C.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s a fighter for freedom of speech as long as it’s Christians doing the talking.  No one is asking the CVC to engrave a sign saying “There’s probably no god.”  Atheists are saying we should keep gods out of our government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if it’s our national motto.  That doesn’t make it right.  We shouldn’t be endorsing Christianity over other faiths, and we shouldn’t be endorsing theism over atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norris doesn’t understand that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How could anyone have anything against the engraving of our nation’s motto, which is above the very speaker’s rostrum in the House of Representatives? How could anyone have anything against the same for the Pledge of Allegiance, which has been recited each day since its inception in both houses of Congress?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all know the right response.  The Pledge that was “recited each day since its inception” didn’t have the phrase “Under God” in it until 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, could the lawsuit by the Freedom of Religion Foundation prevail and prevent the engravings in the CVC? Are you kidding? Mark my words: If a few liberal judges get the case, and we the people do nothing, it will. And then that precedent will be used to extend their next argument that our national motto “In God We Trust” is unconstitutional.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, that would be awesome!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is unconstitutional.  And it shouldn’t be our motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if Norris hasn’t shown enough ignorance, he digs the hole even deeper with this little nugget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Atheists might not be found in every foxhole, but the bunker called the Capitol Visitors Center has a couple in there right now. I think it’s time that Americans let them know that the motto and pledge are not only at the heart of our country, but that whitewashing God from the walls of history is actually an unfair promotion of atheism and an injustice to all that is America.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really…?  The &lt;a href="http://maaf.info/"&gt;foxhole argument&lt;/a&gt;?  Weak…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norris makes a classic mistake: he thinks not mentioning God is automatically a promotion of atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means he ought to also be pissed off at the post office, Taco Bell, and &lt;em&gt;SportsCenter&lt;/em&gt;, because they don’t promote god either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists in general want religion to stay private.  Don’t force us to accept your beliefs.  In return, we won’t ask our legislators to put “There’s probably no God” on every damn thing that comes their way.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For another, I knew the basic shape of things and so I was able to claim the same seat I had Friday (near the front) with little difficulty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the right is what the front of the JREF open announcement whiteboard looked like on Saturday morning (click to embiggen and see all the gory detail). And that's just the front side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, around eight-thirtyish in the morning, Pacific Standard Time, perhaps the craziest and coolest episode the Skeptical Rogues had ever recorded happened live not twenty feet in front of me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Skeptics Guide to the Universe Live Recording&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The live SGU recording of Saturday morning opened with a news story from Saudi Arabia: a family was suing a genie. We laughed a lot at that silliness. They then announced the winner of the previous day&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s That Noisy.&amp;quot; During the subsequent Q&amp;amp;A, she asked Jay to say her name in the way he says the names of the people he quotes. If you listen to the SGU, you&amp;#39;ll know what I&amp;quot;m talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next question came from a British gentlemen toward the front who identified himself as Sid Rodrigues. He noted that he and Rebecca Watson had been dating for some time, and wondered if she might do him the pleasure of marrying him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Right now?" She asked. "Well, it is Vegas. But don't we need, like, a minister?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up walked A Kovacs, Skepchick and JREF Director of Operations, who had just recently been officially vested with the power to carry out legal marriages in the state of Nevada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"But what about bridesmaids?" said Rebecca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up ran the Skepchicks all dolled up in wedding finery. Likewise, the Skeptical rogues reached behind them and pulled up the black jackets, pinned with roses, that had been hanging over the backs of their chairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was at this point that I realized Rebecca was, herself, in on the whole conspiracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To all this, she replied "But I can't get married without my family here!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guess who had flown in for the nuptials?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"But we need music!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up walked George Hrab, strapped with a guitar, softly strumming soothing chords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They began the ceremony, but partway through they realized that nobody on stage had any wedding rings. "Does anyone have any rings we can use?" The audience laughed. A voice came up from stage right: "I have some."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up walked Adam freakin' Savage, Mythbuster extraordinaire, to play the part of ring-bearer. Soon, the bride was kissed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmQ8tcuKajI/AAAAAAAAAq4/ZoWJRKJrZwA/s1600-h/DSCF0361.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Eew, cooties!" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmQ8tcuKajI/AAAAAAAAAq4/ZoWJRKJrZwA/s320/DSCF0361.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They finished the ceremony, brought out some cake, and George Hrab encouraged the audience to dance with the bride and groom. Most people did. I didn't. I don't dance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took a few short videos of it that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkB2BrvpHNc"&gt;you can see here&lt;/a&gt;. My video, however, is crappy, so you'll want to watch &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZgNKZN1Qs&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;the official JREF video of the entire wedding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a way to start the day! They even handed out invitations to anyone who wanted one:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmQ-bBWb5iI/AAAAAAAAArI/J8BFNRoo0Vc/s1600-h/DSCF0440.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:240px;height:320px" title="I should have worn a tux." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmQ-bBWb5iI/AAAAAAAAArI/J8BFNRoo0Vc/s320/DSCF0440.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Shermer: Towards a Type I Civilization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRBWKGL0OI/AAAAAAAAArQ/xFWBF9PBEA4/s1600-h/DSCF0368.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Does anyone else think he sounds kind of like Kermit the Frog?" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRBWKGL0OI/AAAAAAAAArQ/xFWBF9PBEA4/s320/DSCF0368.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the wedding, the SGU recording was finished and they cleared the stage for Michael Shermer. His talk was essentially his "Science of Good and Evil" talk reframed to answer the question of how we get to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_civilization"&gt;Type I Civilization on the Kardashev Scale&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't take too many notes partially because &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2006/10/evening-with-michael-shermer.html"&gt;I had heard it before&lt;/a&gt;, more or less, and partially because it was a lot of politics. He's been talking a lot about politics lately, and I didn't really go to TAM for politics. It wasn't a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; talk, it just assumed a lot of things that as an anthropology major I can tell you are not very solid assumptions. His choice of societal typology, for example, is only one way to categorize societies and is in no way a fixed, authoritative list. He also seemed to assume that all cultures are moving toward something, are making "progress" toward some kind of democratic ideal, when this simply isn't so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't want to bash Dr. Shermer, though, because he is a thoroughly nice and brilliant guy. He's just been really political lately, and it's not something I really dig talking about in a TAM post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One funny bit: he asked the audience to identify where they would put themselves politically. About 80% identified as liberal, maybe 4 people as conservative, and the other ~10% as libertarian. As soon as the 80% raised their hands for "liberal," he said "Oh. Well, then, I guess I'm done here. See you later!" Everyone laughed at that one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adam Savage: A Talk About Failure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRCiIUHgyI/AAAAAAAAArY/vSgaxmH3LqY/s1600-h/DSCF0376.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I fuckin&amp;#39; love this guy." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRCiIUHgyI/AAAAAAAAArY/vSgaxmH3LqY/s320/DSCF0376.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Adam's talk wasn't titled, &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, but it definitely was a talk about failure. He regaled us with stories of some of the more spectacular failures from his life to remind us that "Failure is always an option" is not just the Mythbuster's motto, it's a life lesson: when you fail, all you can do is pick yourself up, learn what you can, and keep going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His first epic fail involved a display for a major New York City department store wherein three pitching machines had to lob baseballs across a room, which then had to be returned to the pitching machines so the whole thing could run in perpetuity. He claimed he could knock it out alone in five days, and they believed him. In the end, it took him six, three of which he worked all night, to work out the myriad kinks that assaulted him as one system after another failed and failed again. In the end, he finally got it working like a charm, and when the executive came to look at the entire display of which Adam's pitching machines were a part, he said "The display looks great. Except for those pitching machines. Get rid of them."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His second epic fail happened in his early 20s. He was trying to style himself a production designed for films, and a friend hooked him up with one of &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; friends who needed a set designer for his low-budget indie film. Adam took the $800 he was allotted, spent the next two weeks frantically pretending he had done all of this before and had everything under control, and made a complete and total FUBAR of the entire set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of the crew was &lt;i&gt;pissed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They called him into a room with a chair in the center and a spotlight on the chair (they got him there by holding his toolbox hostage) and berated him for quite a long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently they were even &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; pissed off because they had found out that the weekend they had to pull all-nighters just to deal with his fucked-up set, Adam, instead of helping out, was across town having sex instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really enjoyed Adam's talk. It was funny, poignant, and, well, it was Adam freakin' Savage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skepticism and Magic Panel, with Penn, Teller, Jamy Ian Swiss, and Ray Hyman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRQlvQMBpI/AAAAAAAAArg/x3KoAgAIjBg/s1600-h/DSCF0381.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Penn really is humongous." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRQlvQMBpI/AAAAAAAAArg/x3KoAgAIjBg/s320/DSCF0381.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I don't remember too much from this panel. Mostly it was a discussion of the ethics of deception of the public, through which I learned a few things: the panel seemed to think Criss Angel is as big a douche as I think he is, Teller &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; speak, and Penn is &lt;i&gt;freakin' obsessed&lt;/i&gt; with morality. He was seriously sweating two parts in their act where he directly lies to the audience as part of the misdirection from what they are really doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I took down two notes during the panel. First is the phrase "half-smart," which sounded like it had most of its currency among magicians and con-men. It's essentially what happens when you exhibit the Dunning-Kruger Effect: you know a little but think you know a lot. Like a guy who knows a little bit about cheating at poker tells the con-man dealer "Now don't deal off the bottom of the deck because I know all about that shit!" He thinks it's made him smart, but in reality, the con-man now knows everything the half-smart man knows about poker, and so can cheat him even more effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also wrote down "Penn on global warming." Penn spoke, for a moment, very candidly about AGW when prompted by a question from and audience member, and it was quire funny. He first wanted to let everyone know that when he says "I don't know" about AGW, he doesn't mean it as some kind of bullshit cop-out like a holocaust denier who says "Well, I don't know that the holocaust happened." He just means that he isn't a climatologist, and he literally doesn't know the facts they do. He then counted the following off on his fingers to explain his current understanding of climate change:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Global Warming isn't necessarily happening.&lt;br&gt;BUT...It probably is.&lt;br&gt;2) If global warming is happening, we didn't necessarily cause it.&lt;br&gt;BUT...We probably did.&lt;br&gt;3) Just because we caused global warming doesn't necessarily mean we can stop it.&lt;br&gt;BUT...We probably can.&lt;br&gt;4) Just because we can stop it doesn't mean controlling carbon emissions is the way to do so.&lt;br&gt;BUT...It probably is.&lt;br&gt;5) All that said, it doesn't necessarily follow that socialism is the best way to get these things to happen.&lt;br&gt;BUT...It might be. Who knows?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was funny and I was glad to see Penn follow the evidence on the climate change front. It was tempered, though, by that old canard I see so often from conservatives and libertarians: anything they don't agree with politically is "socialism." That kind of tactic is polemical, semantically inaccurate, and it really doesn't foster discussion. It's like if I labeled every single thing George W. Bush did as "fascism." Which some people do, and it's just as silly and inaccurate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, onto our next talk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steve Bauer On Jerry Andrus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really didn't know much about Jerry Andrus going in, and I still don't know much coming out. Steve Bauer was his friend and the executor of his will, and he spoke about Jerry's life, his inventions, his magic, and his skepticism. It was somewhat interesting, but I didn't retain much because of my lack of familiarity with Jerry Andrus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skepticism in Broadcasting Panel, with Bill Prady, Penn Jilette, Teller, Adam Savage, and Jennifer Ouelette&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmWMaaBekBI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/oYpqfgu7ibI/s1600-h/DSCF0400.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Penn = still huge." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmWMaaBekBI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/oYpqfgu7ibI/s320/DSCF0400.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Penn talked a lot about morality on this panel, too, and at one point quoted Ayn Rand saying that there are only ever two sides to any argument and there is never any middle ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, Penn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, Prady spent most of this panel cracking pretty good jokes while simultaneously reminding everyone that he has zero social responsibility. At one point, an audience member asked what the chances were that we could get a skeptical TV channel. Penn said "There's the gay Catholic fisherman channel, so how can we &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; get one?" Prady said he knew there was a great joke in there somewhere but couldn't think of it immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, they talked about instances of good skepticism in the media, like that show "The Mentalist" that I've never seen. Adam reminded everyone that you can't go into a show saying "We're going to do this and people will love it," you have to make a show you love or you'll get burnt out and you'll probably fail. He commented that he thought the "Bullets Fired Up" myth from Mythbusters was probably the tightest test they've ever done and that he thinks, of any of them, it's the one most worthy of publication in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I got up to ask how we can try to reclaim the word "skeptic" since it's been so abused by the Ghost Hunters, who say "We're really skeptics at heart," but then show us lame EVP as solid "evidence" of a haunting. Prady said "I've never heard of that show you're watching because I'm always too busy watching 'Father Bill's Bottomless Bass-Fishing.'"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After much laughter and an apology to the GLBT community, Adam said he knew exactly what I was talking about and that he, too, hates it when people co-opt language in that way. Penn interpreted my question as an attempt to paint skeptics as martyrs and victims (which it was not) and railed about how he hates that when you've got The Mentalist and Dr. House and Numb3rs (which he consistently pronounced "Num-three-ers") and the like that paint science and critical thinking and even atheism in a positive light. That's all well and true, but it wasn't at all the question I had asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil Plait: 2012 Doom!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRcCRaxQ-I/AAAAAAAAAro/cxp70NP1YFI/s1600-h/DSCF0409.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I know it&amp;#39;s blurry. I&amp;#39;m a crappy photographer." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmRcCRaxQ-I/AAAAAAAAAro/cxp70NP1YFI/s320/DSCF0409.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Finally, after everyone else and all those hours (and that's not counting the years since I started reading Bad Astronomy, back when it was still just a regular website), I got to hear the Bad Ass-tronomer hisownself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think I can relate exactly just how big a fan of Phil I am. Years ago, I discovered Bad Astronomy and the JREF's SWIFT newsletter at about the same time, and it was through them that I really discovered organized skepticism. When I founded the Purdue Skeptics Society in 2005, Phil was one of the first people I contacted to get a price for a talk. It was way too much for us to afford, but our brief correspondence left me thinking "Wow, he really is a nice guy." Hal Bidlack said that in real life, he's not as nice as he seems online; he's nicer. He brings such a passion to skepticism, such a love of astronomy and such a wealth of knowledge, and he's such a magnificent writer and science educator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, it was a huge freakin' thrill to finally hear him speak in person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His talk revolved around the 2012 doomsayers (no astronomy pun intended). He explained why one of their initial claims were wrong: the sun passing through the galactic equator has nothing to do with its actual position in the galaxy, just its apparent position relative to other stars from Earth. He tossed out the "We'll get hit by a meteor!" theory. He dealt nicely with some stupid idea that the sun's transition across the galactic equator put us into "the age of 2012," by pointing out that 2012 was right near the tail end of the cycle; it wasn't even in the middle. It's just anomaly-hunting and shoehorning nonsense together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He even predicted a future claim they might make: that when the sun is directly between us and the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, the extra gravitic pull from the black hole will &lt;i&gt;destroy the earth&lt;/i&gt;. Except that's nonsense. The pull from the sun on an average day is something like a trillion times stronger than the pull from the hole at the core. The pull from the &lt;i&gt;moon&lt;/i&gt; is hundreds of times stronger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damned inverse square law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil was engaging, funny, exciting (and excited) and one of his slides was "The sun of DOOOOM!" which turned out to be a picture of the sun onto which Phil had crudely drawn an angry face in MS Paint. Somewhere in that goofy joke is the core of why I love Phil so much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The HAM Party Talent Show&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmVpdfuAN8I/AAAAAAAAArw/fXURzUjsYp8/s1600-h/DSCF0425.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Our three illustrious judges." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmVpdfuAN8I/AAAAAAAAArw/fXURzUjsYp8/s320/DSCF0425.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I bought a ticket but only stayed for half. George Hrab MCed in a white tuxedo, and he was as charismatic and funny as you'd expect. The judges panel was Richard Saunders from the Australian Skeptics, Captain Disillusion from YouTube, and Randi's Personal assistant Sean McCabe (I think that was his name).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The less said about the show the better; I refer you to my "ranting" section from &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/07/amazng-meeting-7-thursday-and-friday.html"&gt;my first TAM post&lt;/a&gt; to explain why I cannot, in good conscience, say that some of the acts for which I stayed were any good. I will not bemoan then, but neither will I pretend they were good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of them weren't bad. The guy singing Sinatra was okay, but he lacked vocal force. The kid doing martial arts was really talented (especially with the bo), but he lacked stage presence; as Captain Disillusion said, had he choreographed his kata to music from Mortal Kombat, it would have been fantastic. The classical guitarist was &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; impressive. And that's all I'm going to say about what I saw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I heard, though, that the second half had a rapper and a bed-of-nails act that were pretty amazing. I didn't stay, partially because I was unimpressed with my expenditure of $15, and partially because I had to get up early to give a presentation the next morning and I still wanted to spend some time at...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Skepchick Party&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmVvH8vPemI/AAAAAAAAAr4/-zmJbucIljA/s1600-h/DSCF0429.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:240px;height:320px" title="That&amp;#39;s just the front. You should have seen the patio." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmVvH8vPemI/AAAAAAAAAr4/-zmJbucIljA/s320/DSCF0429.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By virtue of asking nicely, I got an invite to the Skepchick party which doubled as a wedding reception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I'm not much of a party guy. My role at parties is to sit around and feel uncomfortable, and, for a while, this one was no exception. I stole myself a seat on the patio. Before long, someone sat next to me and we started talking about random stuff. A couple of minutes after that, another guy and his girlfriend sat down next to us. He looked familiar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hi, I'm Matt," he introduced himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Matt? Wait. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dillahunty"&gt;Matt Dillahunty?&lt;/a&gt; '&lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Atheist Experience&lt;/a&gt;' Matt Dillahunty?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure was! Pretty awesome, I thought, that he decided to sit there. I read their blog all the damn time, though I don't have enough time to watch the show. We talked for maybe an hour or so about the Atheist Community of Austin, Austin itself, the recent upsurge in the use of &lt;a href="http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Transcendental_argument#CARM.Org_Version_of_TAG"&gt;Matt Slick's formulation of TAG&lt;/a&gt;, my girlfriend's trouble with people tearing down fliers from her atheist organization, &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; girlfriend's trouble with people tearing down fliers from &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt; atheist organization, and even Ayn Rand's purported solution to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_problem"&gt;is-ought problem.&lt;/a&gt; Someone snapped the following very blurry picture of me, Matt, and his girlfriend whose name (like so many others) I cannot remember:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmVx7coz1lI/AAAAAAAAAsA/sMSq1nhesnY/s1600-h/DSCF0427.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I wish I had had enough money to buy a camera that wasn&amp;#39;t so damn crappy." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmVx7coz1lI/AAAAAAAAAsA/sMSq1nhesnY/s320/DSCF0427.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Matt's serendipitous choice of seating arrangements turned what would have been, for me, a rather boring evening into an enjoyable one. I dig decent conversation with interesting people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks, Matt! I hope I didn't bore you too much!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after the picture was taken, I excused myself to catch the constantly-running van back to the South Point as I had to give a presentation at 8:30 the next morning. Out front, I talked with Evan Bernstein for a minute and was accosted by a friend and/or relative of Rebecca Watson, a rather tipsy middle-aged woman who tried to make me feel bad for leaving early even though she herself was doing the same thing. I recognized a fellow curmudgeon and told her to fuck off with a smile on my face. She then mentioned to someone how she wanted to bang a few twenty-something dudes. A minute later she turned to me and said "You're lookin' pretty hot to me right now."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that was my Saturday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between a somewhat late night at the party and a presentation coming up first thing in the morning, I didn't get much sleep Saturday night. I was up at 7 to ensure enough time to shower and shave, and I was down in the ballroom by around 7:45. Dr. Ray Hall was in charge of the paper presentations and he walked me through how things were going to go. At 8:30 he announced me (and my family tuned into the live feed at Ustream) and I set to. I was vaguely nervous at first; it's somewhat difficult going up there when in the back of your head a little voice keeps repeating "Nobody came to see &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. You're not James Randi or George Hrab or Phil Plait." As I talked, though, I remembered that I knew the material pretty damn well, and I remembered how much I love being the center of attention. It was pretty smooth from there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could it have been better? Yeah. But it could have sucked &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; more. No sense in beating myself up over what I dropped now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was presented with this handsome certificate:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmV8sBRrsTI/AAAAAAAAAsI/lJVITjWUSEo/s1600-h/Certificate.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I didn&amp;#39;t edit it for anonymity reasons or anything." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmV8sBRrsTI/AAAAAAAAAsI/lJVITjWUSEo/s320/Certificate.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some kind fellow was nice enough to take pictures of me while he was covering all the famous and interesting people at TAM, and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobothemagicone/sets/72157621551855758/"&gt;he put them up on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobothemagicone/3726927416/in/set-72157621551855758/"&gt;This one is my favorite&lt;/a&gt;. I gave out candy to reward positive audience interaction during the second half of my presentation, and he caught me in mid-toss (with a somewhat odd look on my face). &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bobothemagicone/3726926742/in/set-72157621551855758/"&gt;In this one&lt;/a&gt; I am inadvertently wearing Derek Zoolander's "Blue Steel" face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish the lighting was better and the resolution was a bit higher so you can see how truly epic I look in my new suit. Ah, well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the presentation, I milled about for a minute working off adrenaline and drinking glass after glass of water. A few people approached me and complimented me. That was really cool, and I'm grateful to all those people who enjoyed my little talk. I'm wracking my brains to think of a suitable, original topic on which I can write and submit a paper for next year. So far I got nothin'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I missed most of the next three talks because I was in my room changing out of my suit, packing my junk, and heading downstairs to check out (I left my bags at the bell desk). I arrived back upstairs in time for...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brian Dunning: So What Were the "Lost Cosmonaut" Radio Transmissions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian's presentation was a follow-up on the Skeptoid podcast "&lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4115"&gt;Search for the Missing Cosmonauts&lt;/a&gt;." That one's one of my favorites because, interpreted through the purported translation of the mysterious transmission, it is extremely creepy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had really dug into what information was out there to try to figure out who the woman in the recording was and what she might have been doing. As it turns out, there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there were any female cosmonauts around at the time of the recording. The idea that it was a space-plane and not an actual rocket didn't pan out either, as the Soviets never had a working space-plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He eventually had four Russians each independently translate the transmission, and it turns out that the famous, creepy version of the translation really wasn't accurate at all. Some of the phrases could have been taken totally differently, some of the things the legend puts in the woman's mouth weren't there at all, and a lot of it was just unintelligible gibberish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian figured that it was pretty likely she wasn't in space at all, just working in a ground installation and maybe talking to someone in the air. His final conclusion, though, was that we'll never know for sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; Tim Farley and Christian Walters: How Are We Doing? Evaluating the Skeptical Web Presence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I enjoyed this presentation. They gave lots of practical information for upping your pagerank and designing a website or blog to effectively attract traffic. One thing I'm definitely going to start doing is using the "NOFOLLOW" tag when I link to woo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They showed some numbers from Google that misspellings of words like "Chiropractic" and "Acupuncture" accounted for more searches than the words themselves, and suggested that the misspellings be included in the tags attached to posts on those topics to help bring in traffic. I think it's a great idea, but it wouldn't really work with Blogger's label system; it would just pollute my file drawer. Maybe I'll switch label systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After that, Phil delivered some closing remarks and told us he'd see us all at the Live Million Dollar Challenge. I ate lunch at the buffet (delicious!) and managed to get in somewhat near the front of the crowd for the spectacle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Live JREF Million-Dollar Challenge Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I'm sure many of you already know, dowser Connie Sonne was tested in front of a live audience Sunday afternoon at TAM7. Banachek was the test facilitator (a condition to which Connie had agreed), and there were strict rules for us in the audience: no noise, no moving about, and no photography. The line was long and wide; everyone wanted to see one of these things happen live. Alison Smith from the JREF has written &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/641-connie-sonne-preliminary-challenge-test-at-tam-7.html"&gt;a detailed summary of the test&lt;/a&gt; (and why Sonne's more recent ad hoc explanations for her failure are nonsense).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me tell you: if you ever have a chance to see a MDC test performed live, &lt;i&gt;skip it&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly. It was boring as hell. I understood why everything had to be done the way it was done, and I'm glad it was designed and controlled so well, but that didn't make it any less boring. Once Connie set to with her dowsing, she'd concentrate on her little ideomotor pendulum for five or ten minutes, saying nothing. She would then indicate the envelope she thought held the card for which she was dowsing. Banachek would unpack and arrange the ten cards from the next suit, roll a ten-sided die to determine which card she was supposed to find, and then she'd do it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She surprised nobody (save perhaps herself) when she got none of the three correct. She had a 1/1000 chance of getting all three, which was the agreed-upon condition for passing the test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of the protocol, so she and everyone else was satisfied that there had been no cheating, she was asked to cut open the envelopes containing the cards she did not pick; in that way, she could make sure that each suit did indeed contain the ace through the ten, and they hadn't stacked the deck against her. This process, while wholly necessary, was completely interminable. As she cut each envelope, Banachek would reach in, remove the card, and say "This is the three of diamonds," and so forth, while showing her the card and having her acknowledge that it was, and she hadn't been cheated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever they came across the card she had failed to find, Banachek would say "This is the seven. This is the card you failed to find. Is that correct? Did you fail to find this card?" That acknowledgment was probably also a necessary part of the procedure, but by the end I almost felt bad for her. Every envelope she opened must have been a turn of the knife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, in the days after the test she started bullshitting about how Banachek and the JREF had cheated her and how she had really dowsed correctly and blah blah blah, so fuck her. Like I said, the link above to Alison Smith's write-up deals neatly with her claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the test, I sat outside in the hallway and listened to Metallica's "Ride the Lightning" for a while. I had time to kill and little to kill it with. TAM was over, my flight wasn't until 11:30 that night, and I was too tired to read any of the books I had with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I mentioned in an earlier post, by that point I was also in a pretty black antisocial funk, so that didn't help. I passed up an opportunity to hit the strip for a few hours with some folks because I was simply in no mood to spend more time with strangers. Looking back, I can say I should have gone, but that's not really true; I know how (regrettably) miserable I was at the time and I wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway, so it was probably best that I didn't go out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I saw it, my options were to sit at the hotel all afternoon, or to sit at the airport all afternoon and have free internet access. I chose the latter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And God damn did I have a lot of e-mail when I got there. Thanks to everyone who fielded responses to Tarantallegra while I was gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pocketbook willing, I'll probably be back next year. The Fiancee said she'd totally go if she can afford it, and &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;Tom Foss&lt;/a&gt; thinks that now he has a real grown-up job, he'll probably be able to make it too. I think that'll make all the difference. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though my immediate experience after leaving TAM felt negative, once my batteries recharged I'm more energized than ever. Drs. Gorski and Albietz sent me tons of great information to use during the anti-anti-vax section of our &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/02/gen-con-skeptics-panel.html"&gt;Gen Con Skeptics Panel&lt;/a&gt;, Derek from Skepticality stopped by the blog and offered his conventioneering advice and eventually got me hooked up with author and skeptic Michael Stackpole to lend a bit of a hand at Gen Con, I might be giving my presentation to a local charter school, I'm in the beginning stages of organizing a SkeptiCamp here in Indiana, and we've decided that if our Gen Con panel goes even halfway well, we're going to try to organize a vaccination drive at Gen Con next year akin to the one at this past TAM that raised enough money to get over 500 Nevada children vaccinated free of charge. Dr. Albietz was the big man behind that, and he's offered his help and advice if we need it for next year. The man's an anti-anti-vaccine warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that was my TAM experience, more or less. In the next couple of days I'm going to put up one last post tentatively titled "TAM7: Bits and Bobs" that'll cover some miscellaneous stuff that didn't really fit into either of these posts and during which I'll also post some of my other pictures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-297878976866696736?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248167580695"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/has_jupiter_been_struck_by_an.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19420521710178d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cosmos"/><title type="html">Has Jupiter been struck by an object?</title><published>2009-07-21T08:32:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T08:32:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/1P1_7B2J5UQ/has_jupiter_been_struck_by_an.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/has_jupiter_been_struck_by_an.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It would appear so.  We see it in a ...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Preliminary image showing a black mark in Jupiters South Polar Region (SPR) which is almost certainly the result of a large impact - either an asteroid or comet - similar to the Shoemaker-Ley impacts in 1994. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is on Anthony Wesley's web site, and what appears to be the outcome of an impact event has been photographed by him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of his post reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I started this imaging session on Jupiter at approximately 11pm local time (1300UTC). The weather prediction was not promising, clear skies but a strong jetstream overhead according to the Bureau of Met. The temperature was also unusually high for this time of year (winter), also a bad sign.

&lt;p&gt;The scope in use was my new 14.5" newtonian, in use now for a few weeks and so far returning excellent images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find reasonable imaging conditions and so I decided to continue recording data until maybe 1am local time. By about midnight (12:10 am) the seeing had deteriorated and I was ready to quit. Indeed I had hovered the mouse over the exit button on my capture application (Coriander for Linux) and then changed my mind and decided instead to simply take a break for 30 minutes and then check back to see if the conditions had improved. It was a very near thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came back to the scope at about 12:40am I noticed a dark spot rotating into view in Jupiters south polar region started to get curious. When first seen close to the limb (and in poor conditions) it was only a vaguely dark spot, I thouht likely to be just a normal dark polar storm. However as it rotated further into view, and the conditions improved I suddenly realised that it wasn't just dark, it was black in all channels, meaning it was truly a black spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://jupiter.samba.org/jupiter-impact.html"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And you can read the entire exciting story here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

24/7 and one-on-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the kind of care my 12-year-old son needs. One-on-one teaching at school and certainly somehow is always with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he may not always need the one-on-one staff to Charlie ratio, Charlie will always need support and care, full-time.  Currently Jim and i are able to provide this for Charlie. While we always have our minds turned towards the future and how we'll keep providing what he needs throughout his life, what consumes the greater part of our energy is helping Charlie in the here and now. Jim and I are able to take care of Charlie while both working full-time; we both teach college students and are able to have flexible schedules. Nonetheless, I've often had to consider not working to take care of Charlie which would help in some ways while making other things (our finances) a bit difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people are in the same boat. And that's why parents of children on the spectrum Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers, and self-advocates Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg and Lindsey Nebeker have started &lt;a href="http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/ask-michelle-obama-to-meet-with-autism-families/sign.html"&gt;this petition&lt;/a&gt; to ask First Lady Michelle Obama to meet and form an "Autism Corps." Here is the petition's full text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, the undersigned, propose that Michelle Obama meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa, Jennifer Byde Myers, Rachel Cohen-Rottenberg, and Lindsey Nebeker, representatives of the autism community, to discuss effective strategies for providing urgently needed direct assistance to overstressed autism families and individuals on the autism spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that an Autism Corps, based on the &lt;a href="http://www.teachforamerica.org/"&gt;Teach for America&lt;/a&gt; model, can supply trained volunteers to effect this assistance and provide four to fourteen weekly hours of one-to-one in-home support for people with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe supporting adult autistics and autism families who have immediate needs for day-to-day assistance supersedes discussion of ongoing autism research and causation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in supporting measures that benefit all in-need children with autism, adult autistics, and autism families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of an "Autism Corps" addresses a need sounded here and all over by many in the autism community. More people trained to assist individuals on the autism spectrum means that support could be available for individuals in their homes and in their communities, in the settings that they know and are familiar with. It means that parents and others who care for autistic individuals might be able to work to provide much-needed financial resources for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a parent, I love my son unequivocally as he is, for who he is. It's a reality that he has many needs and that "just not anyone" can take care of him. I'm grateful that I can work to provide the resources to help support Charlie and provide him with all that he needs. But I know not everyone can do so and the time may come when Jim and I need help that we can't readily find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently 154 people have signed the petition. Please sign &lt;a href="http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/ask-michelle-obama-to-meet-with-autism-families/sign.html"&gt;this petition&lt;/a&gt; to ask Michelle Obama to meet and form an "Autism Corps."

Most of the stories I’ve seen have been accurate, but I’ve run across a couple of people who misunderstood what they read. I thought I’d try to put the record straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An FDA advisory panel has recommended reducing the maximum allowed single dose from 1000 mg to 650 mg in over-the-counter acetaminophen products. The 1000 mg dose would be available by prescription only. They also recommended eliminating painkillers like Percocet and Vicodin that contain a combination of a narcotic and acetaminophen. They did not recommend removing acetaminophen from over-the-counter cold remedies, cough medicines and similar products that combine acetaminophen with other drugs. Advisory panel recommendations are not binding, but the FDA usually follows them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people got the impression that the FDA had just discovered that acetaminophen can be dangerous. No, we always knew that. The danger is when you take too much: it can damage the liver. The “new” information is just that acetaminophen overdose is now the leading cause of liver damage, causing an estimated 1600 cases of liver failure each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used appropriately in recommended doses, acetaminophen is one of the safest drugs we have. It rarely causes any side effects. It is the drug of choice during pregnancy. We even use it for pain and fever in babies. The alternatives are more dangerous: aspirin can lead to Reye’s syndrome; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen can cause GI bleeding and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum recommended dosage is 1000 mg four times a day, or 4000 mg total per day. There are exceptions: people who have liver disease, who drink significant amounts of alcohol, or who take Coumadin should take less than that. Some other medications interact with acetaminophen by increasing its metabolism and making the standard dose less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem that led to all those cases of liver damage was that patients did not follow the recommended dosage. Either they didn’t take the label seriously and took too many pills, or they inadvertently got a higher dosage by taking combinations of acetaminophen-containing medications, often not realizing what they contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who take maximum doses for arthritis have complained that it would be inconvenient and cost them more money to get the prescription-only 1000 mg pills. But there would be no need for them to do that: they could simply make up that dose from whatever size pills are available. Three 325mg tablets add up to 975 mg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been concerned that drugs like Vicodin will no longer be available. You could conceivably get the same thing by taking a hydrocodone pill plus an acetaminophen pill. Unfortunately, plain hydrocodone is not currently available in the US, and it may require new drug applications and new clinical studies to demonstrate efficacy before such a product can be approved. Hydrocodone mixed with acetaminophen is a Schedule III drug, but hydrocodone alone falls under the more restrictive Schedule II of drugs that have more abuse potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they recommend removing acetaminophen from Vicodin but not from Nyquil? Apparently because they thought the actual incidence of liver failure was lower from the over-the-counter products. Possibly because of other considerations. It certainly seems inconsistent – perhaps even backwards. Vicodin must be prescribed by a doctor who can take some responsibility for educating the patient, but Nyquil is sold without any supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new recommendations are intended to protect the consumer. They may protect some people who don’t read labels and who don’t take responsibility to avoid combining medications inappropriately. On the other hand, a few people will still manage to take overdoses by taking too many of the smaller-dose pills or combining them with cough and cold medicines. And eliminating the hepatotoxic component of Vicodin might free patients to take more of the narcotic and might lead to more addiction. It seems to me that a better approach would be to educate the public and put stronger warnings on the products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to include some great skeptical materials debunking common moon landing denialist claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also some good video debunking material of moon hoaxers &lt;a href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/a-team/Conspiracy"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;slightly more than halfway down the page.&lt;/p&gt;

As a member of the JREF forum, I had been following the excitement surrounding the event for some time.  I followed much more closely when I learned I was the fortunate recipient of a scholarship and would be attending myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived on Thursday not quite sure what to expect. I knew I'd be overwhelmed. But I thought what would overwhelm me was going to be the experience of being in the presence of celebrities. That's what we're led to believe, that famous people are awe-inspiring. I met so many of them. I had my picture taken with Banacheck, Mac King, Penn, Phil Plait, Jamy Ian Swiss, Teller, the Great Tomsini, Captain Disillusion, and of course Randi, whom I had the pleasure of sitting next to during the entire magic show.  As amazingly cool as all of that was, though, it's not what really astounded me. What has really touched my heart, what overwhelmed me, is the kindness of simple, ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;To put the significance of this into context, I need to give you some of my background.  I have ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  It has left me (more or less) wheelchair bound, with excessive weakness in my hands and arms.  As if that weren't enough, it has also left me with a severe speaking disability.  This makes daily living difficult, to say the least.  The prospect of a 2,500 mile trip by myself was daunting, and seemed to court disaster.

Yes, I'm referring to a guy named &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=mike+adams+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Mike Adams&lt;/a&gt;, who runs a website called &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=naturalnews.com+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;NaturalNews.com&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Adams has made NaturalNews.com a bastion of quackery and outright wingnuttery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently that isn't enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how long it's been around, but apparently Mike Adams is branching out. Now he's decided that he wants to do a wiki about "natural" living. He's calling it, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://naturalpedia.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Naturalpedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcome to NaturalPedia.org, the free encyclopedia on natural health and natural living. This site was created (and funded) by NaturalNews.com and is designed to provide a natural alternative to Wikipedia.com, which has become too strongly influenced by drug companies and western medical biases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course. So what does Adams want to do about it? This:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please help contribute to NaturalPedia.org. Feel free to post truthful information about natural cures, natural products and natural living. Although this site is just being launched, in time it will grow to be a large and valuable resource on the kind of natural living wisdom that the FDA and other corrupt authorities would prefer to banish from the internet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far be it from me to turn down such a heartfelt request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_health_ranger_mike_adams_needs_your.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_health_ranger_mike_adams_needs_your.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/IDBjJbFucj0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248152455182"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=5593">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d04da1ef19933cd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Divorce"/><category term="Family"/><category term="Gender"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="fighting"/><category term="marriage"/><category term="stress"/><title type="html">Fight Club: His</title><published>2009-07-21T00:51:56Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T00:51:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/fight-club-his/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I realized Jill had a thing about teeth when I opened my mouth. I know I should’ve spoken calmly. But I didn’t, because she tends to take a fragment of knowledge, often from the Internet, and run with it. There’s nothing wrong with that — people have run with less in their hands — but sometimes she runs, where Alex is concerned, in what I think of as a wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/mad-cat.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of Elsie esq. (flickr.com)" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of Elsie esq. (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t know it’s a wrong direction, so maybe she’s right. And deep down I think she’s waaaay smarter than I am, so maybe I should trust her on this. Maybe it’s a right direction; maybe he did lose an adult tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the last firework has burst across the night sky and the crowd’s gone home to bed, I tell Jill: there was no blood; there’s no jagged hole in Alex’s mouth where the tooth was; there’s no jagged broken root of tooth. And he was giggling all through, obviously excited. You’re right, Jeff, Jill would say later. You’re right. I just have a thing about teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should’ve just asked Alex what had happened. Oh that’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve compared Alex to a problem, a blessing, a burden, a new vision. I think he — or more specifically, the autism that stands between us and him — is most like a cat. Loving, special, deep, and essentially wordless. When the focus of two married people who are getting kind of pissed at each other doesn’t really use language, no hilarity it going to result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage is a fragile bridge as it is; autism is a hell of a storm coming up the bay. I have taken the route of telling Jill (next Feb. 1st it’ll be 20 years to the day since we met, and it still stuns me when this special, special lady find anything I say informative and impressive) that maybe our marriage is at that middle-aged point where people just naturally don’t agree as much. Reasonable. Except autism isn’t reasonable; people on different sides of the vaccine issue, for instance, have swapped death threats over each other’s opinions. People enmeshed in this life can be militant about their outlooks, or at very least can write a lot of long paragraphs about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you think we fight a lot?” Jill asked on Saturday night, after we’d both had a really nice gin and tonic. No, we fight no more than any two people who are in a marriage that’s undergoing something that a marriage, just by the nature of its cables and span, has a very hard time standing up to. Doesn’t mean the bridge is going to fall down, but it does mean it might make great footage on The Weather Channel.&lt;/p&gt;

What d’ya think?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well extinction is probably an impossibility. There are always pockets of Christianities left behind who still exist in the backwoods. His pastor probably meant American evangelical Christianity, since it is growing by leaps and bounds in parts of Asia and in the Southern Hemisphere. So the question is whether evangelical Christianity will be relegated to the backwoods in one generation in America. Who knows, right? I think I agree with him, if that's what he meant. Yes it will. &lt;strong&gt;You have one generation evangelicals--40 years at best here in America. I won't be alive to see it, but I do predict it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Here is what Chuck wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;John,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great post. I had lunch with a friend of mine yesterday. He happens to be a young pastor, graduate from Trinity and is planting a church in Minnesota. He preached on Acts 17 and how Christianity may be 1 generation from extinction. His premise was that the Gospel is irrelevant to younger Americans for three reasons 1) Personal experience of abuse within Church 2) Intellectualism and inability to understand the mysteries of faith (e.g. The Trinity, Jesus as fully human and fully divine) 3) Cultural alienation (e.g. An Indian resident who has no context for monotheism). I suggested a fourth area where the Gospel is being questioned and that is around the desire for truth-seeking people to pursue a path with not as many obvious internal self-contradictions. As I take a skeptical look at the superiority claims of Christianity centered on sciptural inerrency claims I am coming to see the bible as a product of men trying to understand their cirucmstances via myth. Therefore the whole foundation of a Christian God starts crumbling for me. Your post hightlights the inability for scripture to be an absolute guide towards optimal morality because it perfectly supports the institution of slavery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friend agreed and said he wishes the bible said exactly what you have said, "It is absolutely wrong to own another human being." He still holds their is a lesson to be learned by considering these aspects of the bible as part of a larger narrative. I see them as self-contradictory and therefore am coming to the conclusion that Christianity and the bible are elements of our culture but are not superior to other elements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the thoughts. Good stuff.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3165806423181750147?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have had six heart attacks in a year and have been offered a by-pass operation. But, its side-effects scare me, besides I have a terrible fobia[sic] against this very major operation. I am told by experts that SCIO can help me . . .” (&lt;a href="http://thesop.org/health/2009/07/19/stockholms-new-unique-clinic-combining-conventional-and-alternative-medicine"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is SCIO, you ask?  Well, it stands for Scientific Consciousness Interface Operation, which of course makes no sense, and is just another version of some guy using fancy words to swindle people out of their money, never mind that it might kill them.  It claims to mix the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“sciences of mathematics, quantum physics, fractal dynamics, subspace theory, electronics, and computer programming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the good old “healing” modalities of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“naturopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic, energetic medicine, psychology, aromatherapy, reflexology, colour therapy, Neuro- Linguistic Programming, biofeedback and Rife Resonator.” (&lt;a href="http://www.quantumenergywellness.com/index-7.htm"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just to be clear, some jackass has actually convinced someone that their “super-math-quantumphysics-fractal-subspacetheory-homeopathy-reflexology-acupuncture” computer is a good reason not to get a recommended by-pass operation!  This is why I do not suffer alt-med gladly, even if it does provide some with a nice little placebo effect.  People are seriously harmed by both the con-artists and the true-believers when they forgo medical practices where there is actual evidence that they work, not to mention the money they throw away on useless therapies and lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Disneyland mood is completely ruined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I don’t have time to engage in a long discussion about my remarks, I feel it’s necessary to clarify that my advice for a skeptical man attempting to pick up an astrology-believing woman would have also been my advice for a skeptical woman attempting to pick up an astrology-believing man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t defend attempts at humor that may have fallen flat, but I will say that the gender of the individuals in my hypothetical situation was not at issue, my point had to do with how skeptical individuals might proceed in a social situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I may still have quibbles with the tone of the clips, and how the joke sat in that context, overall, I am satisfied with what he has to say.  It seems consistent with what many of us perceived as his misreading of his audience, and, as I have maintained throughout this discussion, does not in any way invalidate his larger point about being a skeptic without being an asshole; a topic which I very much look forward to hearing his further thoughts on in the future.  I also appreciate that he felt it was an important enough problem to take the time to address it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248143425998"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13984">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bbbe6d6da0045b63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Purity Ring-Tone?</title><published>2009-07-21T02:00:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T02:00:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/20/purity-ring-tone/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you want to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/14/iphone-purity-pledge-apple"&gt;pledge your virginity-until-marriage&lt;/a&gt;, there’s an &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322278959&amp;amp;mt=8"&gt;app for that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The application has a pre-recorded pledge for both genders that the user must accept before being able to display their ring on a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are preaching to the converted, and we’re going for people who wouldn’t buy a ring. The app is not the be-all-and-end-all of purity pledges: it’s an entry point.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Asked whether the virtual nature of the ring might lead people to forget their vow of abstinence in the heat of the moment, Bennett replied: “If you’ve taken the pledge, you’re likely to follow it through.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do know how we can get the app to work, though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program it to sense when your hand is holding the iPhone.  If your hand lets go of it, that can only be because you’re about to have the sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, the app begins to make an annoying noise that only your father can turn off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you make an abstinence pledge work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Sandra&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...consumers are forever demanding more power, in the form of torque and acceleration, from their cars. Just as important, however, is the lack of incentives for the automobile to invest in efficiency. Electric and even hybrid technologies are decades old, but we're still waiting for a mass-production electric car from Detroit. Gasoline has been too cheap to worry about and largely still is. It's axiomatic that if fuel costs were to rise significantly, we would start to see a major push for improved efficiency. The close correlation between the rollercoaster of demand for the Toyota Prius and the price of gasoline last summer is a case in point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a robed ‘priest’ used a hairdryer marked ‘reason’ in an apparent bid to blow away the waters of baptism once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several dozen participants then fed on a ‘de-sacrament’ (crackers with peanut butter) and received certificates assuring they had ‘freely renounced a previous mistake, and accepted Reason over Superstition.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this to me seems like a good bit of fun.  It’s a goofy little ceremony, the hairdryer is a clever little prop, and everyone has a good time and bonds a little.  They aren’t doing it in front of churches to piss off Christians, they aren’t doing it in front of news cameras, they’re having a ceremony and having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as we all know, accommodationists and religious intolerants abound!  I won’t waste time on the religious intolerants in this case, but the article quotes atheist Phil Zuckerman saying “he would never take part in such an event because it ‘feels intrinsically negative’ and ‘immature.’”  I think this is absolutely the wrong reaction to have.  I might agree if the baptisms were performed right in front of churches or something, as if the atheists who were being de-baptized were trying to annoy Christians, but that is not what they seem to be doing.  They are simply having fun with their lack of belief.  On their own time, in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also talks about how it could be a bit more than that.  It could be a way to make coming out easier or more meaningful to some.  Although I was baptized Catholic, religion was never very important in my family and I don’t feel a need to de-baptize myself, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong to do so.  It’s not always easy to come out as an atheist, depending on where you live and who your friends and family are, and for some people a silly little ceremony may make it feel less scary or make it less difficult.  Similarly, for some it may take an open act of defiance towards the church they were raised in in order to show themselves that they’ve really left it.  If that’s what some need, this is about as harmless an act of defiance as I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve called the ceremony silly several times now and I just want to make clear that I don’t mean that pejoratively.  I mean it’s silly because they use a hairdryer labeled reason.  I like the idea, I think it’s a good one and people who want to should take part.  Atheists who have a problem with it, or think it’s “immature,” either don’t understand the purpose of such a ceremony, or are one of those filthy accomodationists who think that atheists should just keep out of sight.  If you’re one of those, well I have &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/"&gt;a blog you’ll love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The CLASS Act being marked up isn't in and of itself isn't bad, but the contrast--and perhaps interconnectedness--with the CCA being ignored is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post contains a &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/adapt-outraged-by-exclusion-from-health-reform.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://adapt.org"&gt;ADAPT&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the support of the CLASS with no mention to the CCA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally the two acts were supposed to be related.  CLASS essentially enables individuals who currently have good employment (middle class and above) to save money out of their pay checks for long term supports later on.  CCA essentially ends the institutional bias of medicaid so that when those individuals need the supports--as well as (more importantly to the topic of this blog here) low income or non-working individuals who currently need the supports--will be able to get those supports from the community instead of being forced into a nursing home or institution.  This doesn't just make financial and ethical sense, it's literally &lt;a href="http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/ada/olmsteadoverview.htm"&gt;the law&lt;/a&gt;.  The comments are at least as interesting as the original post.  Especially worth reading is the one about benefits bias from Mark Romoser (who also always has an interesting comment worth reading here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post contains a brief summary of current events with the &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/-class-act-amended-long-term-services-and-supports-in-health-care-reform.html"&gt;CLASS act&lt;/a&gt;.  What's interesting about this post isn't the post itself as much as the second comment about the costs of long term care--and the concept that what people would pay out for the CLASS Act might not actually cover their true long term care costs.  &lt;/p&gt;

JPL has observations &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-112"&gt;that confirm that Jupiter got whacked hard by an impact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-112"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/irtf_jupiter_impact.jpg" alt="IRTF image of Jupiter impact"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image was taken by the Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. This IR image is at 1.65 microns, about twice the wavelength of what the human eye can see. What this shows is the bright impact site and to its upper left particulate matter — debris — thrown up by the impact and lit by the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Wow. Jupiter got hit by something big. More observations will be coming in soon, and maybe we’ll learn more about what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to be clear; I was cautious &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/19/new-black-spot-on-jupiter/"&gt;in my earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, which I still think was warranted, but I’m glad to be wrong.

&lt;p&gt;The point of this post is that if you have the opportunity to go to Disney World or Disneyland on your birthday, do it because it’s worth it; at least if you’re one of those people who likes receiving well wishes and compliments and smiles all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll have a real post up soon.&lt;/p&gt;

Jeffrey Macdonald&lt;/strong&gt;.  There’s nothing in it particularly newsworthy to atheists who read the blogs, but there are some decent quotations and some news for people outside the movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The ranks of nonbelievers are on the rise, research suggests, and as they seek out each other online and in small groups, they are increasingly looking to do more than just vent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are adopting rituals themselves, from de-baptisms to wedding ceremonies, as a way to cement ties among members. Others are organizing science-related outings or enrolling in community-service programs. Nationwide, atheists’ groups are now treading, sometimes gingerly, into unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the transition moment right now,” says Dale McGowan, author of “Parenting Beyond Belief: On Raising Ethical, Caring Kids Without Religion.” “Some groups are really diving in [to foster a robust sense of community], and some of them are holding their noses and standing on the diving board. They’re not quite sure what to do.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s definitely an article to cite the next time someone asks what atheists are &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; and not against.&lt;br&gt;

We are actually merging population biology with genomics. While in population genomics our basic unit of study is an organism, in metagenomics it is a DNA sequence. This presents many challenges: properly sampling the microbial habitat and extracting the DNA, understanding which organisms the DNA in the samples came from, gauging sample depth, assembling the sequences, identifying genes, assigning a biological function to those genes, to name a few.  There are many different experimental and computational procedures for doing so, and they should be meticulously documented...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Pharmaceutical companies advertise pills to improve mood, from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3xqCtDdNNQ"&gt;SaraFem&lt;/a&gt; (this was another name for Prozac, targeted just to women), to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-iGzaDs5iM"&gt;Midol&lt;/a&gt;, to the new hormonal contraceptive Yaz (which has recently gotten in trouble for the way they promoted their mood improvement, if you look at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO-G8O0lHq0"&gt;their new ads&lt;/a&gt;). Different tampons and pads are advertised to reduce discomfort, improve sleep, reduce smell or the possibility of being ‘discovered.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s not to say there aren’t some at least moderately positive portrayals of menses: the coming-of-age feeling that comes with the first period, the relief that comes from getting a late period after a pregnancy scare. And if you can think of other positive portrayals, please do share them in the comments. That said, it’s no surprise that most people who study periods study it from a negative perspective. They tend to look for negative mood disturbances, for incidences of PMS, for variations in PMS or PMDD symptomology. Most of the studies I’ve read over the years have negative mood or stress questionnaires (like the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire); they often preempt women to confirm symptoms by providing them with a list. Very few of them attempt to discover variation in positive emotions through the menstrual cycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notable examples to this are Emily Martin’s book The Woman in the Body (1980) and a smattering of articles. In 1994, Walker was interested in dispelling the notion that women’s experiences of their menstrual cycle had little cycle-to-cycle variation, and that these experiences were negative. What she found was that most women experience significant cycle-to-cycle variation, which she says means that hormones explain only a small amount of the variation in mood (Walker 1994). Walker also found more positive mood at midcycle and more negative mood premenstrually and menstrually. Brown et al (2008) also found increased positive well-being at midcycle. There is other evidence that menstrual cycle phase does not strongly predict mood: Mansfield et al (1989) found that women’s negative mood and arousal were more strongly predicted by the day of the week than menstrual cycle phase – negative mood and arousal decreased on weekends. I don’t know that I have enough information to agree or disagree with Walker’s conclusion that hormones explain a very small portion of mood, but I do think that hormones are important, and cultural conditioning is important. Which one is more important may not be as relevant to this discussion as just noticing that we need to pay attention to both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do reproductive hormones impact behavior and cognition, if they do at all? Unfortunately, there just isn’t enough evidence for me to be comfortable with sharing much of an answer. There are potential mechanisms aplenty, particularly regarding estrogens. Shively and Bethea (2004) review monkey literature and, while they find consistent results regarding estrogen-cognition-mood relationships, they temper this finding because the sample sizes of most of the studies reviewed were quite small. Further, most of the studies involve inducing menopause, which means they are comparing monkeys essentially with and without estrogen, rather than measuring cognitive differences in monkeys with naturally occurring variation; this would be far more useful if we are at all interested in premenopausal women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next question to ask is, what do we know of any impacts oral contraceptives may have on behavior or cognition? And again, the answer isn’t too satisfying. Brown et al (2008) found women on hormonal contraception reported more negative well-being than non-contracepting women. Walker (1994) found that the cycle-to-cycle variability she found in non-contracepting women was significantly reduced in contracepting women. Bancroft and Sartorius (1990) found significant variation in improvement or deterioration of libido on oral contraceptives: libido seemed to depend on which type of hormonal contraception, but results were also complicated by the fact that they found women who had negative experiences of hormonal contraception tended to stop using them, creating a data set that appeared more satisfied with their prescriptions than perhaps was the case. Joffe et al (2003) found that women with a history of depression were more likely to experience complications with contraceptives, and those with the potential to get early-onset premenstrual mood disturbance or dysmenorrhea saw an improvement. Finally, women who use both a barrier method and hormonal contraception report much higher sexual satisfaction than condom-only or hormone-only users (and in fact, hormone-only users had the lowest satisfaction) (Higgins et al. 2008).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where does this put us? Well, the relationships between hormones and mood and cognition are very complicated, and hormones only constitute part of the process. Culture, personality, heck, even day of the week is important. That said, the few results we have on oral contraceptives do seem to indicate that they have an impact on mood – some of this may be physiological, but some, such as the improvement in sexual satisfaction by dual users in the Higgins et al (2008), are more likely related to the calm afforded by feeling doubly protected from pregnancy rather than an effect of the estrogens or progestins. I would like to see further study on natural cycles and contracepting cycles on all sorts of behavioral and cognitive factors, and should oral contraceptives prove to negatively impact any of them, this should be a labeled side effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My final part of the series will briefly discuss my own opinion on hormonal contraceptives, as well as information on other contraception options available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Oxford+Reviews+of+Reproductive+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F2075004&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=The+effects+of+oral+contraceptives+on+well-being+and+sexuality&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=1990&amp;amp;rft.volume=12&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=57&amp;amp;rft.epage=92&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F2075004&amp;amp;rft.au=Bancroft+J&amp;amp;rft.au=Sartorius+N&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Anthropology%2CHealth%2CBiological+Anthropology%2C+Medicine"&gt;Bancroft J, &amp;amp; Sartorius N (1990).

Five students on the autism spectrum were taking public transportation back to their school after a picnic and are issued penalty notices by a Transport for London (TfL) inspector and police, even though their teachers explained that (from a &lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/07/prweb2652704.htm"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; issued by Eagle House Group in the UK):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;..."due to their profound disability, [the students] were naturally exempt from paying a fare and unable to produce their freedom passes being unable to carry and maintain them themselves. Despite the obviousness of the situation and clear explanation of our staff, 5 penalty notices were issued - one to each child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really gets to me is what happened next. I know my own son would be highly agitated just to have strangers, and ones with the air of officialdom, speaking in accusatory tones concerning him. But then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tfl staff pursued our staff continuing to ask questions once the children had reached their stop and had disembarked. The children then faced a 15 minute delay by the side of the road whilst full details were taken. On one of the hottest days of the year so far (32 degrees centigrade), this was an extreme procedure that could have been avoided with some compassion and a little common sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tfl has dismissed the penalty notices but the school staff seek both an apology and an assurance that such unjust treatment not occur again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has happened a few times when we have been in the New York subway that we have directed Charlie to go through the turnstile without swiping twice. The reason has been completely one of safety: The New York city subway can be pretty chaotic (um, understatement) and it only takes a split second for Charlie to wander away and, too, to board a train while one of us might still be fumbling with our MetroCard. (When he was younger, I could have seen him trying to go down to where the tracks are---fortunately, that's not the case but you never know.) Once Jim directed Charlie through the turnstile ahead of him and two transit officers were right on the other side; they were amenable to Jim's explanation on seeing Charlie. But, going by the experiences of other parents, and of the Eagle Group school staff,  that kind of compassion is hit or--more likely---a miss.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248126908118"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/the_open_laboratory_2009_-_the_16.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b7e42a1491582fd0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="OpenLab09"/><title type="html">The Open Laboratory 2009 - the submissions so far</title><published>2009-07-20T19:56:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T19:56:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/bmOb-nywzhY/the_open_laboratory_2009_-_the_16.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/the_open_laboratory_2009_-_the_16.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenLab logo.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/OpenLab%20logo.jpg" width="448" height="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our very own Bora "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/"&gt;Coturnix&lt;/a&gt;" Zivkovic discusses the rise of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823"&gt;The Open Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.nextgenerationscience.com/science-resources/the-open-laboratory-interview-with-bora-zivkovic/"&gt;Next Generation Science&lt;/a&gt;.  (Disclaimer:  I'm one of the authors anthologized in &lt;i&gt;Open Lab 2008,&lt;/i&gt; so anything which makes the series sound respectable, I'm in favour of.)  Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Three years ago, as we were preparing the first Science Blogging Conference, my friend and colleague &lt;a href="http://mistersugar.com/"&gt;Anton Zuiker&lt;/a&gt; (Twitter: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mistersugar/"&gt;@mistersugar&lt;/a&gt;) was talking to a number of potential sponsors for the meeting. One of those sponsors was &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/"&gt;Lulu.com&lt;/a&gt;, local print-on-demand book publisher. The Lulu.com representative suggested that one way they could support the conference would be to publish an anthology of some of the best blog posts written by science bloggers. Having only about four weeks left before the conference, Anton thought this was not sufficient time to produce such a book, especially as the winter holidays were coming, so he negotiated a different kind of sponsorship deal with Lulu.com. But he mentioned the idea to me over coffee one day soon after and my response was something along the lines of "Impossible? Watch me!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, before my wife was released from the hospital after hip replacement surgery, her leg began swelling up and she had great pain and discomfort. Quickly she was sent back to surgery to have a previously undetected bleeder repaired. The highly respected surgeon obviously missed it. Next day a huge bouquet of roses appeared in her hospital room, sent by that very doctor. And then, perhaps coincidentally, he retired from practice within the next few weeks. I don’t recall now whether he actually said he was sorry for his error, but the roses gave us every indication that he was. It was a malpractice suit waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We had no intention to sue him and we didn’t, but of course he couldn’t have known that. We were actually pleased that he acknowledged his error (indirectly at least). Contrary to the belief of some surgeons, he was as subject to error-making as any other human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it looks like saying you’re sorry seems to be catching on in the medical world &lt;a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_DOCS_SAY_SORRY?SITE=MTMIS&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=national-2008.php"&gt;(see here)&lt;/a&gt;. According to this article, it not only makes everyone feel better, but saying you’re sorry also actually cuts down on medical malpractice suits.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I'd guess that being honest is one way to deal with the current debates about cutting medical costs. As many politicians are learning these days, things get much worse when you try to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;cover up your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Yes, I'm nervous about it, and yes, I'm definitely going to do it once we get 100 donors.  If you'd like to donate, some fantastic charities that I can recommend are:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.heifer.org/"&gt;Heifer International&lt;/a&gt;: providing livestock and training in poor areas around the world, helping people to lift themselves out of poverty, while requiring them to, in turn, train others and donate some of the animals' offspring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/"&gt;Kiva&lt;/a&gt;: providing no-interest loans to entrepreneurs in impoverished areas, allowing them to lift themselves out of poverty.  They repay these loans, and you can then re-loan the balance out to another entrepreneur.  You can learn more &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/about"&gt;about them here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://doctorswithoutborders.org/"&gt;Doctors without Borders&lt;/a&gt;: also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).  They provide aid in over 50 countries to people whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe, primarily due to armed conflict, epidemics, malnutrition, exclusion from health care, or natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/homepage/main.html?zone=403"&gt;Donors Choose&lt;/a&gt;: an online charity that allows you to choose what you donate to classrooms in need.  Allows both local and remote donations, and you can choose which supplies you want to donate as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Some other suggestions can be found at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencewoman/2009/07/help_ethan_siegel_shave_his_he.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;Sciencewoman's blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/help_a_charity_get_a_sciencebl.php"&gt;Ethics and Science&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/07/help_others_help_ethan_shave_h.php"&gt;Scicurious&lt;/a&gt;.  Any charity of your choosing is just fine, of course.  If you donate, just leave a comment &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_charity_ch.php"&gt;on my charity challenge page&lt;/a&gt;, and tell me where you donated, how much, and why.  When we get to 100 (as of this second, we've got 32 unique donations), I'll shave my head.  And, of course, I'll &lt;a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/donate.html"&gt;donate&lt;/a&gt; the hair to &lt;a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/index.html"&gt;Locks of Love&lt;/a&gt;, which anyone can do by ponytailing the clean, dry hair up, cutting it, and mailing it to 234 Southern Blvd., West Palm Beach, FL 33405, USA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the heels of this, two sciencebloggers, &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/chest-waxing-for-charity/"&gt;Physioprof&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/chest_waxing_for_charity.php"&gt;DrugMonkey blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/ethan_siegel_puts_his_chest_ha.php"&gt;Isis of Isis the Scientist&lt;/a&gt; challenged me to do them one better.  The challenge?  Independent of the head-shaving, they want me to &lt;i&gt;wax my entire chest&lt;/i&gt;.  That's right, this chest:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/a_charity_extra_going_above_an/n1207789153_457816_7836.jpg" width="500" alt="n1207789153_457816_7836.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but they want it &lt;i&gt;videotaped&lt;/i&gt; and uploaded to YouTube.  The reward?  $1000 to whatever charity I choose.  Isis, Physioprof, in addition to my own charity challenge, &lt;b&gt;I accept&lt;/b&gt; your challenge, and I choose &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/"&gt;Kiva&lt;/a&gt; as the charitable institution to donate to.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiva has everything I look for in a charity.  They're a non-profit, the funds go directly to an individual in need, the individual is responsible and accountable for the money, it gives them an opportunity to not only achieve their own success and self-sufficiency, but they &lt;i&gt;pay it back&lt;/i&gt;, allowing you to donate that money over and over again to whatever individual projects resonate with you.  They partner with a myriad of developing countries and national/international organizations to fund these people, who are looking for an opportunity -- not a handout -- to achieve their goals.  It's the kind of charity that everyone, regardless of your politics, can get behind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Isis, Physioprof, and anyone else who chooses to be a part of this, &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; will find a place that is willing to take on the challenge of waxing my entire front torso &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; will allow me videotape it, and I will upload the video to YouTube.  You will donate $1000, over and over again, as long as the money continues to be repaid.  And we will see how many people we can assist by allowing them to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/a_charity_extra_going_above_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248122350099"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/memetics_of_meaning_memory_and.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf19b67c0d1d0b15</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anthropology"/><title type="html">Memetics of Meaning, Memory and Me: The minefield of the annoying or endearing mannerism</title><published>2009-07-20T19:03:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T19:03:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/uB-Hzh4xCKI/memetics_of_meaning_memory_and.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/memetics_of_meaning_memory_and.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Did you ever notice how some verbal expressions have an extra meaning for you, just you, because of history?  In reflecting on this, it is impossible to not consider such lofty topics as memes, cultural transmission, and ... well, meaning.  A particular expression might invoke a memory of an event, or of a person who often uses that expression. That can be a pleasant experience, or an unpleasant one.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the story wasn’t enticing enough, Darwin’s wife Emma is played by &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Connelly&lt;/strong&gt; (who is also the real-life wife of &lt;strong&gt;Paul Bettany&lt;/strong&gt;, the actor who plays Darwin.  Got that?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://hq.ellf.ru/2007/03/20070330-Jennifer.Connelly.HQ.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hq.ellf.ru/2007/03/20070330-Jennifer.Connelly.HQ.2.jpg" title="Jennifer" width="418" height="526"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yummers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hulk&lt;/em&gt;, and this?  She’s causing nerdgasms everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a couple downsides to the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, when the movie premieres in America, there will be protests by evangelical Christians.  And the advertising will surely point out how “controversial” this theory is — it’d be the smart way to go in terms of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there’s no “controversy” about evolution at all in the minds of intelligent, educated, scientifically-literate people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other downside is that this movie will probably focus less on the science than the relationship between Darwin and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of being an awesome science movie, it’ll be a mediocre romantic one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/footprint_lg.gif" title="footprint_lg.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/footprint_lg.gif" alt="footprint_lg.gif" width="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an outstanding achievement, by any measure, and one that has become emblematic of what we are capable of. I couldn’t possibly do justice to what it must have meant to people at the time - I was just a few months old when this took place - but there are wonderful accounts all over the web, and I’ve been enjoying reading almost all of them. I’m sure I would have had the same emotions on that day if I hadn’t been busy drooling, filling my diaper, and being forced to take a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with these initial reactions to the event, I’ve also been reading other accounts of how the directions of people’s lives were driven by the moon landing. These are also fascinating, and I have been particularly interested by scientists who feel that it was this event that helped fuel their interest in science, because my own experience was somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I had a healthy interest in science (as well as a lot of other subjects) from an early age, I have never felt that the space landings had an effect on it. I was certainly enthralled by the space program, read magazines about it, and the newspapers, and watched anything that was shown on television about it. I thought about being an astronaut, and fantasized about the excitement of traveling to other planets and beyond. Star Trek presumably had a hand in all this. But what grabbed me was the exploration, and the adventure. Not the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current view is that while there may be a reasonable argument for the manned space program on the basis of exploration (and I find the idea exciting myself), it is hard to make a &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; argument for it. I often hear the argument that the space program is nevertheless useful to science because it inspires people to become scientists, or at least to be interested in science. This must be true at some level, but I’ve never found it a compelling argument. Nevertheless, this isn’t the point I’m trying to support with my comments above - clearly many scientists &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; felt inspired to be scientists by manned space travel. It just happens that I wasn’t one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, having been suitably serious, awed and humbled by the heroic endeavors of NASA, Armstrong, Aldrin, Collins and those who followed them, I thought I’d leave you with something a little lighter. Here’s British transvestite comedian Eddie Izzard’s (NSFW, due to some naughty language) take on how the astronauts could have made the moon landing even more entertaining.&lt;br&gt;

This act allows for the marketing and sales of “dietary supplements” with little or no regulation.  This act is &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=489"&gt;the work of folks like Tom Harkin (who took large contributions from Herbalife) and Orrin Hatch&lt;/a&gt;, whose state of Utah is home to many supplement companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHEA has a couple of very important consequences (aside from filling the pockets of supplement makers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/default.htm"&gt;the FDA &lt;/a&gt;require of “supplements”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the dietary supplement manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that a dietary supplement is safe before it is marketed. FDA is responsible for taking action against any unsafe dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. Generally, manufacturers do not need to register their products with FDA nor get FDA approval before producing or selling dietary supplements.* Manufacturers must make sure that product label information is truthful and not misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase: “sell whatever you want, just don’t let us catch you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more frightening than this inexcusable lack of oversight is that many of the products marketed under DSHEA aren’t just vitamins and such, but products that claim to do the same things as real medicines.  How do they get away with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2008/01/quack_miranda_warning.php"&gt;Quack Miranda Warning&lt;/a&gt;, that’s how.  Anyone who lives in the States knows this one almost as well as the “real” Miranda warning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put in the asterisk because there’s always an asterisk.  The warning always appears at the bottom of a back page in very fine print.  This statement is required when making any clinical claims regarding a product, and it is up to the manufacturer to make sure all claims are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: many products covered by DSHEA are, by their advertising, &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; “intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent…disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling the warning itself is a great way to hunt for quackery.  I did just such a search recently and came up with &lt;a href="http://www.choosecra.com/store/supplements/pecta-sol.html"&gt;PectaSol&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s hard to tell from the ad who exactly is making these claims: the maker of the product, the online store selling it, or both.  Either way, here are some of the claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enhance your immune system function, especially if you have a chronic disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maintain your optimal health by removing toxic and radioactive metals in your body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slow down the doubling time of your PSA (male prostate) levels when cancer is present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;help prevent aberrant cells from adhering to your critical organs and tissues like the prostate, breast, colon, lymphatic system, skin, brain and larynx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;promote normal cholesterol levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take a supplement that has been successfully clinically tested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shown to reduce your total body burden of toxicity from Mercury by up to 70% in six months when consuming 15 grams of PectaSol per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow &lt;a href="http://www.dreliaz.com/research/articles.php?id=20"&gt;the link that purports to support their claim&lt;/a&gt; of “clinically tested”, a blank page is all you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, they are claiming to treat or prevent disease.  What else could they mean by their claim about PSA or their claim about cholesterol?  These statements may or may not adhere to the letter of the law, but what concerns me more is their adherence to the &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; of the law.  DSHEA was created specifically to allow these companies to make claims that would otherwise be of questionable legality.  DSHEA, as it was written and &lt;em&gt;as it was intended&lt;/em&gt; facilitates the legal marketing of quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This legislation must go.  It’s dangerous and costly for consumers, and provides protection for business entities whose apparent purpose is to promote quackery for profit.  The lawmakers behind this bill should be ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

I just thought I had come to a consensus with the guy I was arguing with that while I didn't really have anything to say if you chose to apply the label "God" to the unknown origin of the universe, as soon as this "God" actually &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; anything then it becomes a falsifiable proposition (or if not falsifiable, at least a proposition to which one can attach a probability) and we can apply science to it... to which he suddenly and unexpectedly responded, "Ah hah! See, you just admitted that your atheism is just another unprovable belief, like any other religion.  Don't try to say it is backed up by science!"  I was initially baffled, but an hour or so later, I think I figured out the mental processes that led him to this conclusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had intended to blog about it that evening, but completely forgot -- until I was reading &lt;a href="http://newhumanist.org.uk/2085"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with Terry Eagleton at The New Humanist, and realized that Eagleton is making the &lt;i&gt;exact same mental error&lt;/i&gt;.  I am beginning to think this misconception I am about to introduce, while it sounds absurd when you state it plainly, is actually quite common.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The misconception could be stated like this: "Atheism" is the belief that anything which is referred to by the label "God" does not exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;It seems that no matter how often we caveat that we are referring to the words "God" and "religion" &lt;i&gt;in the sense that most people understand them&lt;/i&gt;, someone always replies with a redefinition of the terms -- whether it be the deist or pantheist God, a religion that deals only in allegory and metaphor, or what have you -- that dodges the objections of the "New Atheists".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has been dealt with so many times -- in fact, the Sean Carroll post on which I was commenting talks about this problem -- that the only way I can explain the prevalence of this fallacy is if people have subconciously fucked up the definition of atheism in their head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Thou shalt have no other cheesy snack products before me.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://therobalution.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/is_cheetos2_070905_ms.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:150px" src="http://therobalution.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/is_cheetos2_070905_ms.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;As a thought experiment, I would like to propose a new language, which is exactly like American English, except that the word "God" and the word "Cheetos" have been transposed.  It appears to me that Eagleton and his ilk sincerely believe that if an atheist were to travel to a country that spoke this hypothetical language, he or she would stubbornly deny the existence of highly-processed cheese-flavored corn snacks, while casually munching Jesus out of a bag.  (Finally, a practical use for the doctrine of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation"&gt;transubstantiation&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a word: No.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look, if you want to adopt some touchy-feely philosophy where God is a metaphor for the "human spirit" or something, that's fine.  And if you want to call it religion, that's also fine.  &lt;i&gt;That's not what we're talking about&lt;/i&gt;, at least not until you start putting stock in ancient sectarian texts or engaging in magical thinking.  Most of the "New Atheist" writers are quite explicit about exactly what they mean when they talk about God and religion.  To substitute something other than what they describe and say that this defeats the argument is either semantic trickery, a misunderstanding of what the author is stating, or else sloppy thinking on the level that would cause someone to worship a bag of Cheetos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-943671634008608011?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248119159408"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8358">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7bdcf28ab1a6343a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Help me pick you up in a bar</title><published>2009-07-20T19:00:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T19:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8358" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie’s&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8308"&gt; recent post&lt;/a&gt; on Bill Prady’s keynote speech at TAM has been causing a lot of commotion, but most of it is about appropriate attire for women at TAM or in general. If you want to talk about necklines, that’s fine… go over there and talk away. I want to bring this back to the Bill Prady comment that if you want to get laid, you should tell a girl that she has “incredible eyes” and not talk science with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But science is hot! And smart is hot! Smart is the reason I want to leave my husband to run off with Jon Stewart. Smart is why I had to clear the upstairs at the Skepchick Villa so certain unnamed Skepchicks could have a conversation with a certain unnamed neurologist from the SGU podcast. Smart is why I will never get over my girl-crush on Rebecca and the reason Rebecca will never get over her girl-crush on Genie Scott. Smart is what brings us together, here at Skepchick, today. Smart is sexy. And most of us just don’t care for come-ons like “You have such incredible eyes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would be a better pick-up line to use on you? If a person of your preferred gender walked up to you in a bar, how would you want them to complete this phrase, “You have such incredible ______.” Or would you honestly want to hear about your eyes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

The 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.  The very first time mankind walked on the Moon.  From liftoff,

&lt;p&gt;to walking down the lunar landing module for the first time,

&lt;p&gt;It brings up a sense of wonder unlike any other before.  This video by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang"&gt;the onion&lt;/a&gt; is so funny to me because it really does capture that sense of awesomeness, and just how blown away those twelve men who got to walk on the Moon must have been:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/dIkHLO93lCA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's 40 years later now.  While, scientifically, we understand more about outer space, the solar system, and the entire Universe than ever before, space missions and space exploration haven't captured the imagination of the public as it once did in 1969.  &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/07/20/on-apollo-11s-40th-astronauts-reflect-on-space-program/"&gt;Universe Today&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8158519.stm"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; have some interviews with Apollo astronauts that shed some insights on this, but I thought I'd chime in and share my thoughts with you, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to the Moon was &lt;i&gt;risky&lt;/i&gt;.  Six astronauts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/remember_them_this_memorial_da.php"&gt;were killed&lt;/a&gt; -- three in flight training and three in a launch pad fire -- in NASA's space program from 1964 to 1967.  Disasters happened, and the great risks continued to be undertaken because the reward -- the chance to push the frontiers of what we could do and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang"&gt;walk on the Moon&lt;/a&gt; -- was worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And we did it.&lt;/b&gt;  We walked on that Moon, and we did it six times.  I even got to meet the next-to-last man (and the only civilian) who did it, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt"&gt;Harrison Schmitt&lt;/a&gt;.  But think about this.  Think about the names of astronauts.  Who comes to mind?  John Glenn?  Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin?  Alan Shepard?  Maybe even Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space?  These are all names from the 1960s!  Maybe you'll remember Sally Ride as the first woman in space, or someone like Ronald McNair, who was a casualty of the Challenger disaster, but how many of you can name even &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; active astronaut today?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In making decisions about space exploration that focus solely on scientific merit, NASA has lost sight of this basic fact: &lt;b&gt;we are human beings, with dreams of exploration, adventure, and of &lt;i&gt;being the first&lt;/i&gt; to reach new frontiers.&lt;/b&gt;  It's 40 years later, and humans haven't visited one single moon, asteroid, planet, or even comet &lt;i&gt;in my lifetime&lt;/i&gt;.  No wonder so many people think that NASA's a waste; what has NASA done recently that inspires the average person?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would I do?  Forget about going back to the Moon; we've done that and it isn't interesting anymore.  Let's set our sights on something larger: Mars is the obvious choice.  While manned missions are risky and many proposals say they're likely to be one-way, &lt;i&gt;so what&lt;/i&gt;?  We would never be celebrating our great achievement of landing on the Moon if we weren't willing to continue stepping forward despite our hearts being in our throats.  I'm willing to bet that there are even some of you who would &lt;b&gt;volunteer&lt;/b&gt; to go to Mars, even if it meant that there was a one-in-three chance that you'd die before ever setting foot on it and a 100% chance that you'd never return to Earth.  How much would it cost?  $10 billion?  $50 billion?  In the context of current times, isn't it worth that drop in the bucket to inspire the world about what humanity can accomplish again, just like we did 40 years ago?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's so much to say about our trip to the Moon and what might come next, that you owe it to yourself to check out &lt;a href="http://www.outofthecradle.net/archives/2009/07/the-112th-carnival-of-space-the-big-moon-day-show/"&gt;this week's Carnival of Space&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on the Moon and thoughts, memories, and interesting facts about it from over 25 space writers from around the world.  And if any of you have thoughts, memories, or just a story to share, that's what comments are for!

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://www.duke.edu/~yet2/" title=""&gt;Erica Tsai&lt;/a&gt;, the co-organizer of the Friday evening events at ScienceOnline'09, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a graduate student in the Department of Biology at Duke University. I'm in the field of comparative phylogeography which means I look at how the geographic ranges of related species change as their shared environment changes. In particular, I study how a parasitic plant (yes, plants can be parasites too!) and its host tree shifted their distributions due to climate changes following the last ice age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="EricaTsai pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/EricaTsai%20pic.jpg" width="422" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I've done in relation to blogging is to help run a high school student science blog. For a few summers (though not currently), I worked with the &lt;a href="https://howardhughes.trinity.duke.edu/blogs/program/precollege" title=""&gt;Howard Hughes Precollege Program at Duke University&lt;/a&gt;. This program is targeted at local high schoolers (especially minorities and women) interested in exploring basic science. The students work in research labs and blog about their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Was it easy to get the students interested in blogging?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense, yes. These students are generally high achieving and good at academics, so they are very amenable to doing whatever is asked of them, which is great! I would guess that they looked at it as yet another "homework assignment". I regret that we weren't able to better integrate them into online science communities or to introduce them to online resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you wish you had taught them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blogs were seen as an online diary for each person, and that's where the interaction ended. There wasn't a question of reading another person's diary! That's missing a major point of online science. There's the community aspect, even if you are just a lurker. I would have liked to better equip them with online science tools: set them up with an rss reader, point them to Science Blogs, discuss a new article on ScienceDaily, how to set up google alerts/article alerts, etc. I'd be interested in what your readers would put on a list of "Tips and tricks to being part of the online science community". That's not to say that some students didn't figure this out. It just wasn't due to any training from us! For instance, Trisha Saha, a student in the undergraduate Howard Hughes program, was so savvy she's now &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/tsbluedevil/blog" title=""&gt;blogging for Nature Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What blogging guidelines did you give the students?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised at the number of restrictions that came up during this process. First were the many privacy issues of the laboratories involved. For instance, I think a student blogged about some protein she was working on as her research project. But, oops, the PI didn't want it out that they were even working on that protein! Also, there were some safety guidelines (not necessarily pertaining to the students, but rather to protect the labs). For example, students were asked not to post photos of animals, cages, or anything that might inflame anti-animal testing activists. There was some disagreement about how appropriate that rule was, but a conservative approach was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the disagreement about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fundamentally about what is the point of the student blogs. The students were asked to do two main things, one stated and the other unstated. Stated: Report honestly and openly about your experiences. Unstated: These experiences should be positive, professional, and noncontroversial. The first of the unstated rules, while off-putting to us rebellious types, wasn't actually much of an issue. I think this is partly due to the high quality of the program (so there weren't that many problems to report on), and the natural reticence against airing your dirty laundry in public. This reticence, of course, runs counter to the desire for frankness in a blog, so sometimes their posts took on a glossy sheen. I mean, did you really happily and eagerly redo that failed PCR for a tenth time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The professional and noncontroversial rules were more challenging for me. For instance, a student posted about where the whole lab went out for lunch; another student wrote about how all the students met to play frisbee. Some administrators were aghast, how unprofessional! What will a college admissions officer think of that? I was thinking, do you know how many food blogs I read? I can't help feeling like this is where a blogger becomes human. It lends credibility to the realness of their writing and makes them more likable. What's bad about that? This relates to the broader question of what your online presence should be. Just professional? Some personal? My friends and I have argued about having a 'personal' or 'about me' tab on our websites. Some are solidly in the "not one iota of personal information", "it should all be about my research" camp. My counter is, what do you look at when you go to someone's website? I always go for the 'personal' tab. I'm just curious! Maybe I'm searching for a human connection. And that connection makes it more likely I'll remember you, want to read your papers, and work with you in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noncontroversial rule is the one, I think, that runs most counter to being a successful and popular blog. Uncontroversial can mean boring. Especially if we scare the kids into writing only positive and professional posts. Uncontroversial can also mean discouraging deep thinking and discussion about an issue. I have one example in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student was working in a lab that performed animal experiments, where different treatments were given and in the end the animals were euthanized. He described some of the procedures in a post, and did so in a very flippant and callous way. The way it was described was horrible! I imagined PETA or some other activist group swarming down -- and with good reason! Obviously, the PI would have used very different language in describing this experiment, as I'm sure he did to an animal ethics board to gain clearance for it. So the short end of the story is that we asked the student to change the language. But the broader point was lost, and I've found myself puzzling over how better to handle these situations in the future. His original crude language was essentially truthful, but highly controversial and embarrassing. An activist would argue that if an experiment shorn of scientific jargon is repellent, we shouldn't be doing it. I'm sensitive to that, but at the same time I wouldn't want to make any lab a target for bio-terrorism. I wish we had encouraged deeper thinking on the matter and had him write a more thoughtful, measured, analysis of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the point of the student's blog?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At worst, it's a way of generating PR for the program, and it gives students practice at writing about science. At best, it gets students to be thoughtful about their experiences, which hopefully expands and deepens the experience. Also, it'd be ideal if it got students to explore topics they wouldn't normally, and if it challenged them to think really hard about something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for interviewing me, Bora! And I enjoyed working with you on the conference very much.&lt;/p&gt;

The McGregor Museum is a complex building with several wings surrounding an inner court yard, a multi-layered roof, balconies everywhere, and numerous trees in the court yard close in to the building. So, a cat can spend the heat of the day in the shaded crown of a tree, and the cool of the evening up on the building's sun-warmed metal roof.

The interior of the McGregor museum houses numerious exhibits.  The old period rooms and hallways focus on the late 19th century, and other newer areas (not shown) have an excellent set of exhibits on archaeology, human evolution, and "San" rock art.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many religious conservatives in the kingdom believe films from more liberal Arab countries such as Egypt could violate religious taboos. Some also view cinema and acting, as a form of dissembling, as inconsistent with Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The film festival was cancelled upon indirect instructions from the interior ministry,” said an official at the information and culture ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a real shame, as I’m told the organizers had put together a stellar jury full of luminaries like Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz bin Abdallah Al Saud, Abd al-Aziz bin Fahd bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, and Abd al-Rahman bin Fahd bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m told they were going to premiere their own remake of &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;, which we’ll probably never get to see now, although I did manage to find part of the trailer online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/kbjrUOSss_o%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before you get too worried for the people of Saudi Arabia, know that all is not gloom and doom.  At least one member of the royal family &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,528541,00.html"&gt;is advocating&lt;/a&gt; that girls be allowed to participate in sports.  The religious police are &lt;a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7015834133"&gt;learning English&lt;/a&gt; in order to better prevent “vice” among foreigners (which, presumably, will leave them with less time to prevent “vice” among Saudis).  And I have it on good authority that “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl8g8S6F3do"&gt;8 Simple Rules… For Beating My Teenage Daughter&lt;/a&gt;” is no longer the most popular television show in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s possible the film festival will be brought back in the future.  I’m certainly going to continue working on my &lt;i&gt;Iraqi Balboa&lt;/i&gt; screenplay, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248111082670"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=15285">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66666c530765c360</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="price theory"/><category term="Prostitution"/><title type="html">Brothels, Buffets, and Disneyland</title><published>2009-07-20T17:10:30Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T17:10:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/gAk0hDjdNvE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/brothels-buffets-and-disneyland/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I read in a local newspaper about a bordello in Germany, where prostitution is legal, that charges customers a fixed fee: a bit over 100 euros ($140) for an evening of drinks, food, and entertainment.  

This kind of pricing is common to amusement parks (Disneyland, for example), ski lifts, all-you-can-eat restaurants, and elsewhere. It is a way the firm can minimize the transactions costs of pricing each service and also, if the fixed price is set properly, extract the entire consumer surplus.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/gAk0hDjdNvE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By Daniel Hamermesh</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248110473601"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4323">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73b4654ad7502831</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Slightly Off Topic" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 Words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Hyalophora cecropia</title><published>2009-07-20T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T02:49:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/hyalophora-cecr.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Alexander Clair&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-transfer_process" rel="external "&gt;Dye transfer&lt;/a&gt; from Kodachrome* original.
 
&lt;/p&gt;

For more background, see below the fold.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
*&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodachrome" rel="external "&gt;Kodachrome&lt;/a&gt; has just been discontinued after approximately 75 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Clair was an early color photographer, who worked on the dye-transfer process at Kodak Research Laboratories in the mid-1930’s. In 1937, he drove across the country with his new wife and his view camera. One of the functions of the wife was to hold a colored gelatin filter in front of the lens in order to prepare the separation negatives needed for the dye transfer. My wife, his daughter, still has a handful of his dye-transfer prints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two musicians, Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowski, working on their own, invented what eventually became Kodachrome in the mid-1920’s and moved to Kodak in the early 1930’s, where the process was perfected. The film was offered for sale in 1936.  It was a direct-positive slide film.  Kodacolor print film was not available until 1942. Early Kodacolor prints were not very good and had fairly short shelf lives. So Al kept on making dye transfers, only now he made them from Kodachrome slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of Al’s dye-transfer prints were made between the late 1930’s and the 1950’s, the earlier ones without a Kodachrome intermediary.  The noted photographer and gallery owner &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Gould" rel="external "&gt;Hal Gould&lt;/a&gt; examined Al’s  “seminal collection” and noted that the colors of the prints are “as true and fresh as when they were made.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for purists, the early process was technically wash-off relief; dye transfer is a specific example of a wash-off relief process and was introduced in 1946. I do not know when, if ever, Al switched from generic wash-off relief to dye transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

Many thanks to all of you who contacted your congress critters about that!  The bill still has a way to go however, as &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/senate-approves-expanded-hate-crimes.html"&gt;the article notes&lt;/a&gt;.  It's not a done deal, as, among other things, it is being amended to a defense bill that may not pass (U.S. policy making--not always making much semantic sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Followup -- There's a New York Magazine &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/movies/features/57876/"&gt;interview with Hugh Dancy&lt;/a&gt; who plays Adam in the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_at_sundance"&gt;film Adam&lt;/a&gt;.  To the reporter, yes, it is crass to insinuate that someone is less lovable if they are less physically attractive since it doesn't "make up for" being autistic. Otherwise, this is just a little followup blurb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little News -- The new Assistant Secretary of Labor for Disability Employment Policy &lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/odep/welcome/AssistantSecretary.htm"&gt;Kathleen Martinez has been confirmed&lt;/a&gt;.  She comes from a strong disability background, including being disabled herself.  Nothing about us without us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Followup -- I did a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/putting_autism_to_work"&gt;main post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.specialisterne.dk/html/english/home.html"&gt;Specialisterne&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.  Specialisterne ("the specialists") is a Danish company that believes in the value of autistic interest and skills in the workplace, and promotes strengths-based, supported employment.  One of the (many) cool things about Specialisterne is that it doesn't automatically assume that a person on the spectrum is only suited for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/dd_adults_trained_to_clean_bathrooms"&gt;cleaning toilets&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/changing_people_to_fit_jobs_or_finding_jobs_to_fit_people"&gt;sterotyped menial labor&lt;/a&gt;.  Instead the company finds skilled technical work for people with a love for detail, and yes, specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt that bore some repeating because it's a thriving, successful business model that is now expanding into other countries.  According to the BBC, Specialisterne is setting up a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8153564.stm"&gt;new branch in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.  Most excellent.  Here is some &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8155125.stm"&gt;video coverage&lt;/a&gt; as well.  Perhaps someday there will be a branch in my own town?  Perhaps they'd enjoy employing me?  Heh.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248109779264"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13950">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7ec4358aed0ec80</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Support Jennifer in the Blogathon</title><published>2009-07-20T17:00:37Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T17:00:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/20/support-jennifer-in-the-blogathon/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer&lt;/strong&gt; is going to &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/07/blogathon-2009.html"&gt;participate in a Blogathon&lt;/a&gt; next Saturday. She will be blogging for 24 hours straight, posting something new every 30 minutes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the Blogathon is to raise money for a non-profit cause of the blogger’s choosing, and Jennifer has decided that all the money she earns will be donated to the &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;!  (Which is unbelievably generous of her; the SSA can certainly use the support.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re willing to help out, consider supporting her (and the SSA) and &lt;a href="http://www.blogathon.org/login.php?action=pledging&amp;amp;blogid=234"&gt;making a pledge&lt;/a&gt; — donations can be made in a lump sum or by the hour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One down side is that you have to &lt;a href="http://www.blogathon.org/login.php?action=pledging&amp;amp;blogid=234"&gt;register on the site&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s quick and easy.  I did it in about 20 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to give the money immediately, either; you’re just making a promise for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pledged $20.  (If you don’t give at least that much, you’re not really a man.  Um… that goes for you too, ladies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to sign up to do the Blogathon yourself, &lt;a href="http://www.blogathon.org/"&gt;you can do so here&lt;/a&gt;.  Please consider making SSA your beneficiary!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epic TAM7 is over and I’m still decelerating from the experience. Connie’s now saying she’s been cheated. Gee, what a surprise! She has now lost whatever tiny bit of credibility that a few of us might have momentarily entertained in the short time that passed between her failed JREF test and the lame  rationale for failing she attempted to foist on us at the after-test press de-briefing on Sunday, July 12th. (see picture at left). The inevitable slithering that I predicted would be forthcoming has now been thoroughly documented at the JREF Forum and elsewhere.  We have only to wait for my second prediction made in my previous post to come true as well. I’m confident on this prediction: the talk-show circuit is likely booking her up even as I write this post. As Connie told us in the press briefing and later in my one-on-one interview, “…this &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; happen!.” I must be psychic. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We can only hope that our old friend Larry King has the balls to have a qualified skeptic get in five or six minutes of counterpoint when Connie hits the airwaves. What are the chances we get equal time? I won’t hold my breath on that one, but I think I can predict the outcome of that possibility too. Everyone who had the opportunity to watch Connie in action or hear about her via the Internet now knows that the latest  flavor-of-the-mon&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; psychic has arrived – and she’s Danish.  Foreign accents always play well on prime time. She might even get a television series contract…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="sylvialarrykingsmall" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sylvialarrykingsmall1-225x107.jpg" alt="Larry &amp;amp; Sylvia: Who&amp;#39;s next Larry?" width="225" height="107"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry &amp;amp; Sylvia: Who&amp;#39;s next Larry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seriously Larry, if you by some small minuscule chance happen to read this, please know that I would be more than happy to personally take apart Ms. Sonne piece by newage piece at your earliest convenience. I’m ready and waiting to sit down next to her and deal with her eye to third eye. There’s no possible sane justification for what she did – and didn’t do. You can’t handle the truth can you Larry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides all that Connie fol-de-rol, the good news is that being at TAM provided a sea change in the way I now personally view the skeptical movement.  I saw thousands of people who want to spread the skeptical word, create a new era of rational thinkers and who are willing to stand up and say no to all the bat squeeze we have had to endure for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="George Hrab" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/George-Hrab3-225x300.jpg" alt="George Hrab" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Hrab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sat one morning dunking my croissant and partaking of the continental breakfast which included fresh fruit, yogurt and granola, I couldn’t help waxing nostalgic for a time when I first experienced the strength of group identity in my youth. That morning at TAM, there was a strain of some folksy guitar ballad emanating from the stage and as I watched hundreds of happy people, some with longish hair, crazy slogan tee-shirts, others sporting balloon hats and carrying books and origami pigs with wings and all expressing fun loving attitudes strolling by in front of me, I was reminded of a slightly more innocent time when I first experienced …dare I say it ….the hippie movement. Yeah, I know. Many might take umbrage at this sentiment and say nothing in the TAM main room could be more removed from that era. But when I allowed my skeptical mind to imagine just for a moment the thought of a little pot smoke and some patcholi incense wafting through the crowd, I was magically transported back to a time when there was an overpowering sense of hope and new direction in the air. Maybe it was just me that morning.  No matter. I felt I was once again part of a massive &lt;strong&gt;counter-culture movement. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:107px"&gt;&lt;img title="5574_103Penn" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/5574_103Penn1.jpg" alt="Penn" width="97" height="130"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all sat enthralled by Penn Jillette’s rants as he spoke of magic, mentalism and his not-so-subtle verbiage against all the “assholes” in the world.  It all wasn’t too far off from what I remembered hearing issue forth from ex-radicals Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin back in the days when Abbie published his seminal &lt;em&gt;“Steal this Book”&lt;/em&gt; manifesto. Penn even mentioned his collection of Sun Ra recordings and admiration of Frank Zappa. Wow man. All he needed was a headband. And I say that with all due respect.  I was there in 1968 watching Hendrix burn his guitar- several times.  I remember.  It was an awesome, controversial display of non-conformity and the delirious feedback and cheers of the crowd still ring in my ears 41 years later. As Pete Townshend recently asked, “Whatever happened to all that lovely hippie shit?” Well Pete, take a look at the new boss. It ain’t anything like the old boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="Silly Sleepy Head" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Silly-Sleepy-Head1-225x300.jpg" alt="Sleep Deprivation Experiment #1" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep Deprivation Experiment #1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I as deluded as Connie Sonne or are we in the midst of some sort of “higher calling” here? I certainly think so. Only this time around we are sober, (well, ….most of the time anyway) clear-headed and well informed. We have solid leaders and science on our side. Seeing a thousand plus people with the common goal of living in reality makes for an appealing subset in this topsy-turvy world where right has become wrong and fact daily twisted into fiction. Imagine: A thousand people sat in complete silence for over an hour watching a woman twiddle her pendulum over some envelopes in the hope of proving the existence of psychic powers! How wild is that? Even in the 60’s that would have been like,  …far out man. Dozens of scientists, philosophers and academics from all over the world watched this person do her thing with all the respect and cooperation one might expect from a group of students watching a brain surgeon at work. I had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn’t dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about Woodstock. We are at the tipping point of a new renaissance. TAM7 was much more amazing than I could have ever anticipated. Things have come full circle for this old hippie dude - and I’m so glad to be a part of it all. Our skeptical movement is perched on the cutting edge and making a real cultural difference that is showing signs of being not only historical but sustainable.  Thanks to all those like-minded individuals and free thinkers who made my reuuion with my inner hippie complete. Now back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember a particular homily I saw while I was in college in which the priest talked about how you know when your charitable giving is enough.  The answer was that it should hurt a little bit....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve been around these parts, then you know that Dr. Isis likes to support causes she believes in.  I though Scienceblogger &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/startswithabang"&gt;Ethan Siegel's&lt;/a&gt; idea to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/go_help_ethan_raise_money_hes.php"&gt;cut his hair for charitable contributions&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good idea and I have donated as he requested.  But, I still felt like we could do better and I offered him a proposition that I knew would make us both a little uncomfortable....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, last night I left this in his comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alright, Ethan. I applaud your efforts, but I am slightly disappointed to hear people posting about stuff they are already doing. So, I will make you this proposition...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you'll wax your chest on YouTube, PhysioProf and I will each donate $500 to the charity of your choosing. Cash money, dude.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan has accepted, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/chest_waxing_for_charity.php"&gt;agreeing to have his chest waxed&lt;/a&gt; and post the video on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; in return for a $1000 donation to &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/?gclid=CIqAzMXU5JsCFR7yDAodi1W2Ag"&gt;Kiva Loans&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;PhysioProf&lt;/a&gt; and me.  I think that is a pretty &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_charity_ch.php#comment-1785762"&gt;ballsy thing&lt;/a&gt; to do.  From Kiva&amp;#39;s website:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiva's mission is &lt;b&gt;to connect people through lending for the sake of 
alleviating poverty. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kiva is the world's first person-to-person micro-lending website, empowering 
individuals to lend directly to unique entrepreneurs around the globe. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The people you see on Kiva's site are real individuals in need of funding 
- not marketing material. &lt;/b&gt;When you browse entrepreneurs' profiles on the 
site, choose someone to lend to, and then make a loan, you are helping a real 
person make great strides towards economic independence and improve life for 
themselves, their family, and their community. Throughout the course of the loan 
(usually 6-12 months), you can receive email journal updates and track 
repayments. Then, when you get your loan money back, you can relend to someone

&lt;p&gt;As the H1N1 swine flu pandemic gathers pace, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8158468.stm"&gt;with 29 deaths to date&lt;/a&gt;, the attitude of the public seems to vary from rank indifference to blind panic. This view is reflected within my own hospital, where news of a possible flu admission is greeted by some staff saying "so what?" while others demand the equivalent of a biological "hazmat" suit before they get within a mile of a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the intriguing aspects has been the poor grasp people have on how quickly epidemics can evolve and what factors can influence this. Having spent some time recently reminding myself about the mathematics behind the spread of epidemics, I thought it would be a good idea to highlight some of the underlying principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reproductive Numbers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of spread of any infection such as flu depends on how "contagious" the virus is. For an infection to spread within a population, an infected person has to pass it on to at least one other person. Depending on its degree of infectiousness, each infection may be allocated a number indicating its likelihood of spreading rapidly, representing the number of people on average who will be infected by one other case. This is known as the Reproductive Number, signified mathematically as R0. If an infection has an R0 of greater than 1, it will spread exponentially and become an outbreak or epidemic, but if it is less than 1, it will soon die out (hence the old adage that 1 is the most important number in epidemiology). But Reproductive Numbers can be variable, and are also situation specific (e.g. it will be higher in a children’s playgroup in Birmingham than in a rural Scottish village). The R0 for influenza is estimated to be between 1.5 and 3, and around 2 on average (by comparison the R0 for measles is around 15, and polio around 12, indicating their higher potential for spread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t think flu having an R0 of 2 is good news. A useful analogy for the transmission of an infection like flu through a population is the spread of gossip. Let’s imagine you have a unique bit of gossip; perhaps you know that a well-known local celebrity has got secretly engaged and you just cannot resist telling a couple of acquaintances. If they each tell 2 other people, you can see the starting of an epidemic of gossip (with R0 = 2). If the gossip is passed on every hour (although with texting and twitter, it would probably travel further and faster), how many people might have heard the gossip within a day? This question formed the basis of a scenario I ran by some non-clinical colleagues at work recently. Their answers ranged from a paltry "150" to an impressive-sounding "Ten thousand".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what if your gossip was not quite as juicy, and it only infects only one other person on average (R0 = 1)? Perhaps to get your news onto the grapevine you wish to give it a boost, by emailing it to 200 people in the company. After 24 hours, which method/infection type will have resulted in the most infections? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those I asked indicated that this second situation would result in the most infections. In fact the gossip with R0 of 1, despite getting a big kick-start, can only infect a possible maximum of 4800 people. (200+200+200 and so on for 24 generations).  However, the gossip with an R0 of 2 will have infected a gob-smacking 33,554,430 people, or over half the population of Britain (2+4+8+16+32+64 and so on for 24 generations). Any potential bioterrorists reading this please take note: You can efficiently generate a globally-devastating epidemic by infecting just a couple of people with a pathogen with a high R0. There is no need to contrive a massive release of biological agents by detonating germ-filled explosives in the skies over New York or in the Paris Metro. (Movie producers, feel free to ignore this tip and continue doing what you always do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice however, epidemics of infection often quickly run out of steam, even if they have a high R0. Clearly you are unlikely to infect over 33 million people with your tittle-tattle of celebrity gossip. The obvious flaw lies in the fact that after a few generations it will be hard to find someone in the localised population who has not already heard the gossip, so they cannot be "infected" anew, and the further spread of gossip will cease, and the epidemic collapses. (Some of you will also realise this is the reason why moneymaking scams like pyramid selling and ponzi schemes will all fail within a short time of being created). The gossip’s R0 starts out as 2, but then drops as there are fewer and fewer people to potentially infect anew, and once the R0 drops below one, the epidemic burns itself out unless new vulnerable populations continue to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1927 a mathematical model of epidemics was devised by Kermack and McKendrick. This supposes there are 3 classes of individuals, namely those who are susceptible (S), those who are infected (I), and those who are recovered (i.e immune)(R). This is the SIR "compartment" model (and unfortunately further exploration of it requires differential equations beyond my understanding, so my foray into it must come to a grinding halt). It is sometimes adapted to SEIR, for Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered, for infections where there is a significant latent period between infection taking place and the ability to infect. For those of you interested in the background to compartmental modelling, there is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology"&gt;a good overview on wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unfeasible as the gossip scenario for flu might seem in practice, it does illustrate the potential infections have to spread explosively. Various estimates are that half the UK population could still get swine flu, so is the gossip analogy valid and what does it tell us about real infections? Could they eventually infect millions of people in the same way? The answer is yes, but there are many other factors at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the analogy to look at some of these. You tell two work colleagues your celebrity gossip. One of your friends tells her manager, and later on the other friend tells some of the staff in accounts. The epidemic is under way. However, within a day or two, you find that most of the staff in your company have heard the news. They are no longer susceptible, having become "immune" through already having been exposed to the gossip previously. These individuals are like the real-world examples of those who have recovered from an infection. According to the SEIR model, they are "recovered" and are now immune to catching it again, and will not pass it on even if re-exposed, and the pool of "susceptibles" has declined rapidly. Some of the people hearing the gossip could also be regarded to be  "immune" because although exposed to your gossip, they couldn’t care less about it, don’t give it a second thought and wouldn’t dream of telling someone else. These are the equivalent of people who have been immunised by vaccination. An important point to remember is that not everyone in the company will hear your news. Perhaps the cleaners who only come in at night or the staff who work in the post room remain blissfully unaware of it because they fortuitously avoided coming into contact with anyone who was infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Herd Immunity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gossip analogy is useful to explain the dynamics of other aspects of an outbreak, like the protection afforded by herd immunity. Let’s say someone visits your company from head office a few days later. A bit behind the times, he mentions the celebrity engagement by way of conversation. But by now this is old news in your workplace, the 3 people he tells it to are already immune, having already heard the gossip the previous week and they don’t bother mentioning it to anyone else. This is herd immunity at work. A sufficiently large proportion of the people in your company have been immunised to such a degree that new infections will not be able to spread easily. They make up a protective "herd", and the still susceptible cleaners (even now they have switched to the day shift) will never get to hear the gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generation Time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial factor that determines the rapidity of spread of an infection is the “Generation Time” (Tg), or the interval it takes between one individual becoming infected and passing it on to the next. Some infections will spread more rapidly than others, even though they have a similar R0, just because they have a shorter generation time. For example, the 1918 pandemic influenza strain had an R0 of around 2, which is about the same as does HIV. The difference is that the generation time for flu is only about 2-3 days, whereas for HIV it is many months, and often several years. This explains why flu pandemics seem to zip around the globe, while the HIV pandemic has chugged along at a relatively sedate snail pace. (Bioterrorists take note once more: Choose an agent with a short generation time as well as a high R0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calculation of susceptibles versus protected/immunes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a simple and useful formula for calculating the number of people in a population who need to be “susceptible” before an outbreak or epidemic is likely. This is most often used to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population that needs to be immunised in order to avert outbreaks. If the proportion of susceptibles in the population drops below 1-1/ R0, then outbreaks are likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For measles, 1-1/ R0 is 1-1/15 (or 93.3%), hence the advice that we need measles vaccination rates of 90%-95% to avoid outbreaks. For influenza, 1-1/R0 is 1-1/2, or 50%. So if half the population is immune from having had the swine flu before or because they are vaccinated, a major epidemic is unlikely. Obviously with the current swine flu epidemic, there are very few who are immune to H1N1 (which last touched our shores in 1957) and as yet there is no vaccine, so the epidemic would appear to be unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategies for Management.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of epidemics tells us something about how they are best managed. Initially in the UK, the plan was one of containment, where any suspected cases who had travelled to the UK from Mexico or the USA would be isolated, treated and all close contacts given antivirals to prevent them being infected. This it was hoped would contain the epidemic by rendering the R0 &amp;lt;1 and reducing spread. Unfortunately, once widespread onward transmission took place in the general population, this ring-fencing became impracticable, and the shift is now towards treatment and isolation of cases only as they occur. Some estimates indicate that if the R0 for influenza were less than 1.6, then a system of isolation and targeted antivirals would be successful. The fact that this has not succeeded with swine flu indicates its R0 is greater than this, and more likely to be around 2, as for the 1918 H1N1 epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematics here involves not just R0, which is the most relevant factor, but also latent periods, infectious periods and generation times, which are again is too complex to delve into here. A good overview of the influence of these can be &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1181873"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections are fascinating. One of their most intriguing and unique qualities is their ability to spread, often explosively, causing major epidemics of disease or pandemics. Infections have helped shape evolution, history and civilisation, and have ranged from the biblical plagues of antiquity to the more modern global devastations wrought by malaria and AIDS. People usually don’t give more than a passing thought to the historical relevance or consequenses of infection, but occasionally this apathy is punctured by episodes of sheer panic, as is currently happening with swine flu. If nothing else, I hope this blogpost has given food for thought, and hopefully not resulted in even greater concern about the consequenses of swine flu, which fortunately does not seem to be any more lethal than the usual outbreaks of seasonal influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s entitled “The American Science Deficit–And What to Do About It.” Here’s an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, on the 40 year anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, we will hear a great deal about NASA’s woes, the nation’s declining interest in space exploration, and much else. It is crucial, though, to set such observations in the context of a far broader disengagement with science that has occurred in this country since the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched by President Kennedy, the Apollo program was just the most prominent example of America’s dramatic investment of science in the wake of the 1957 Soviet launch of Sputnik. The first Earth-orbiting satellite, beeping at us from above, inspired stark competitiveness fears in the nation: Were we falling behind in technology? Would the Soviets fire on us from the skies, and if they tried, could we stop them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the U.S. Congress jacked up the budget of the recently formed National Science Foundation to $ 134 million, an increase of nearly $ 100 million in just one year. And that was just the beginning–&lt;em&gt;NSF’s budget continued to explode in subsequent years, so that by 1962-1963 it had reached $ 12.2 billion. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[This statement is mistaken: the 1962-1963 figure represents the total federal government R&amp;amp;D expenditure.] &lt;/strong&gt; Meanwhile, Congress created NASA and passed the National Defense Education Act, providing generous funding to encourage American students to pursue careers in science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, that’s just the beginning of the response to Sputnik. At the same time, President Eisenhower pulled science into the White House by creating the office of the president’s science adviser and the President’s Science Advisory Committee; even as the National Science Foundation drew upon the nation’s elite researchers in an attempt to remake the high school science education curriculum. Science journalism also boomed, as a generation of enthusiasts wrote about each daily step of the thrilling space race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the policies and cultural changes unleashed in the wake of Sputnik shaped the course of American science for decades–and made us world leaders. But then, something went very wrong. Science budgets stopped rising and began to fall. Educational investment also declined. Science became ensnared with politics, first the foe of the religious right, and then something to be spiked at will by the Bush administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every time I come back from a vacation, there’s a lot of catching up to do, but I was struck this time around by just how absolutely hopeless it has become to go back and review all the information that piled up while I was gone. I’m pretty sure I’ll be able to answer all the questions from editors who puzzled over my inscrutable articles while I was gone. I’ll probably be able to get back to everyone who have been helping arrange talks for the fall. But I probably won’t be able to wade through all the press releases that showed up, or the tables of contents from new issues of scientific journals. Facebook? Twitter? I’ll just have to pretend the past week never happened. The Internet never takes a vacation, I’m discovering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I’m updating a few posts on the Loom to take into account a few interesting developments that happened last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The disappearing news remains disappeared.  &lt;/strong&gt;On July 10, I &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/10/disappearing-the-science-news/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how a wretched article about sex seemingly vanished from a newspaper’s archives after blogger/columnist/gadfly Ben Goldacre showed just how wretched it was. Goldacre now &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/rape-a-non-correction-from-the-telegraph/"&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt; that on July 13 the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/5818138/British-Psychological-Society-Miss-Sophia-Shaw.html"&gt;a very odd correction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owing to an editing error, our report “Women who dress provocatively more    likely to be raped, claim scientists” (June 23) wrongly stated that research    presented at the recent BPS conference by Sophia Shaw found that women who    drink alcohol are more likely to be raped. In fact, the research found the    opposite. We apologise for our error.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Speaking from my own experience, I can say it’s bad enough to have a newspaper run a correction on an article of mine for a misspelled name or a figure with an extra zero tacked on the end. But turning around the result of a study to its precise opposite–that’s truly embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good that the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;posted a correction. It’s odd that it took three weeks for them to do so, though–especially since Goldacre nailed them in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/asking-for-it/"&gt;back on July 4&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing Sophie Shaw to show how wrong the article was. I have to agree with Goldacre that the correction, as stark as it is, actually only scratches the surface of all that was wrong with the story. At least, I think it does. I can’t actually read the original article on the Telegraph web site. As I blogged pre-swan-ride, the Telegraph had yanked the story, although they hadn’t yanked the title from its search engine results. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/telegraph-search-grab.jpg" title="telegraph-search-grab.jpg"&gt;(Screen grab)&lt;/a&gt; Now&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/search/?queryText=alleyne+rape&amp;amp;Search=Search"&gt; you can’t even find the title&lt;/a&gt;. So now the newspaper has published a correction to a story that, on the Internet at least, no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that newspapers should not follow this example if they want to thrive in the 21st century. Newspapers will have to find ways to distinguish themselves from other sources of information online. While they may have to set aside some of the traditional defining features (like ink), there are many things that will translate well into the future. One of them is a clear, reliable paper trail. But to preserve that trail, newspapers will have to resist the urge to hit the delete key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Firefly Folk: &lt;/strong&gt;Last month I wrote a piece about &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/29/fireflies-the-invertebrate-opera/"&gt;sex and death among fireflies&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. I got an email from the folksinger &lt;a href="http://www.christinelavin.com"&gt;Christine Lavin&lt;/a&gt;, explaining how the article inspired her to write a song, “A Firefly’s Life,” which will appear on her next album. I’ve taken the liberty of reprinting a few lines from the song (she sent me a recording of the song, but I don’t know if it’s kosher for me to post that too…):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s 2,000 species of fireflies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That have been discovered so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can tell by the pattern of our blinky butts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Exactly what species we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There’s Pyractomena Angulata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Photinus Ignatus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And my my gang Photinus Greeni&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I’m a flirty Photi girl waiting for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;that special flashy fun guy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greeni&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fun guy&lt;/em&gt; do indeed rhyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Synthetic Biology Meets Big Oil:&lt;/strong&gt; In January I wrote &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/06/can-e-coli-save-the-world/"&gt;an article &lt;/a&gt;for Yale Environment 360 about getting fuel from engineered microbes instead of the ground. Advocates for synthetic biology-derived fuel claim that it will be better for the environment than ordinary gasoline, although, as I reported, there’s very little research on that question and there are good reasons to be concerned (such as the impact of sugar farming on water). One of the people I interviewed was human genome pioneer Craig Venter, who was leading an effort to grow fuel-rich algae. Last week Venter’s Synthetic Genomics entered into &lt;a href="http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/?p=9788"&gt;a major deal with Exxon&lt;/a&gt; potentially worth $600 million to develop these sun-loving bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This deal is, of course, no guarantee that synthbio fuels will scale up as hoped, or that they will have be an environmental panacea. And it’s worth bearing in mind that other petro-giants like &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/mar/17/royaldutchshell-energy"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/jun/28/bp-alternative-energy"&gt;British Petroleum&lt;/a&gt; also made a lot of noise about getting into the business of alternative energy, only to drop out in recent months. So the news is not a development in itself, but just another item to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Link Love For Science Tattoos&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/07/science-tattoos.html"&gt;Andrew Sullivan’s Daily Dish took note&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/science-tattoo-emporium/"&gt;science tattoo emporium&lt;/a&gt; while I was gone, which triggered a tsunami of email from scientists, grad students, and science &lt;strike&gt;afficianadoes&lt;/strike&gt; aficionados, all showing off tattoos of their own. August 6 will be the two-year anniversary of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2007/08/06/branded-with-science/"&gt;my initial call&lt;/a&gt; for science tattoos, and there seems to be no sign of the response ending soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248106191312"><id gr:original-id="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/07/massage-post-exercise-aiding-or.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7666828f35c90b27</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Massage for exercise recovery: fact or fiction?</title><published>2009-07-20T11:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T11:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/cx_c31Gm8Ko/massage-post-exercise-aiding-or.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/07/massage-post-exercise-aiding-or.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It would probably be an understatement to say I am not exactly fond of religion.  On the other hand, it's hard to really be all that upset at people for promoting tolerance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think there is a parallel here to the Creationism-centric accomodationism/"New Atheist" debate.  Namely, is a religion that accepts Leviticus as scripture compatible with a stance that is tolerant and accepting of homosexuality?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Bible seems pretty unambiguous on this point, so I would tend to answer "no".  And until a little over a year ago, I viewed attempts by LGBT people and their families to reconcile their religion with the reality of their lives to be rather superfluous.  The whole philosophy is based on intolerance; why go to all the mental gymnastics to remake it into something tolerant when you could just discard the whole godforsaken thing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="250" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:250px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;I command you to see this movie.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lgbta.org.vt.edu/movies/For%20the%20Bible%20Tells%20Me%20So.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:250px;height:400px" src="http://www.lgbta.org.vt.edu/movies/For%20the%20Bible%20Tells%20Me%20So.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I have since adopted a somewhat more "accomodationist" standpoint on this, and it was the result of seeing the movie &lt;a href="http://www.forthebibletellsmeso.org/indexe.htm"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Bible Tells Me So&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a documentary about conservative religious parents who have an LGBT son or daughter, and how the family chooses to deal with it.  Some of the parents, as with the straight-laced looking family on the poster, eventually come not only to accept their son, but to embrace the cause of promoting LGBT rights and helping other families to reconcile their faith with a tolerance for homosexuality.  Other families have a much harder time, coming only to a tacit acknowledgment, still disapproving strongly of their childrens' lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The movie is heartbreaking, and helped me to understand just how important this issue is.  Some families are simply not going to give up their beliefs no matter what.  For them, finding a way to reconcile their faith with homosexuality is not just an exercise in academics, but rather it is critical to maintaining their familial ties.  In some cases, it could even be a life-or-death issue, as the &lt;a href="http://www.diversityinc.com/public/4289.cfm"&gt;shockingly high suicide rate&lt;/a&gt; among LGBT teens demonstrates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Bible Tells Me So&lt;/b&gt; puts forth some arguments addressing the passages in the Bible condemning homosexuality and how they can be interpreted in ways other than the obvious one.  The most convincing was a reframing of the story of Soddom and Gomorah, which basically argued that the cities were destroyed because they failed to show proper hospitality to travelers, and that teh buttsex was just a red herring.  I actually buy this one, but it still leaves numerous other passages that are pretty explicitly anti-gay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To deal with Leviticus, they have a rabbi who argues that the word "abomination" is not a particularly good translation, and that the original Hebrew word would have been close to "against tradition" -- so therefore, Leviticus was not saying that homosexuality was evil, it was merely saying that the Jews in the time of Moses just traditionally didn't do it.  This sounds compelling until you remember that the penalty proscribed in Leviticus is nothing short of &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;, which makes it a bit hard to swallow that this was just intended as a style issue.  (And anyway, the historicity of the story of Moses is extremely dubious, which it makes it sort of meaningless to talk about the "cultural context" of a culture that was made-up...)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other mentions of homosexuality in the Bible are similarly framed as an issue of "this is our culture" as opposed to "this is what is right and wrong".  To me, it's a bit ho-hum -- but if it means the difference between a family loving their son or daughter and embracing them for who they are, vs. estrangement and resentment.... Hey, I'm all for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I roll my eyes a bit when the churchies march past in the Pride parade.  But I'm glad they are there, anyway.  It's progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-760771609103740217?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248105476273"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/everything_you_always_wanted_t_6.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ada85428e6a6f27</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="OpenLab08"/><title type="html">Everything you always wanted to know about The Open Laboratory</title><published>2009-07-20T16:01:22Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T16:01:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/DSa_46a98-o/everything_you_always_wanted_t_6.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/everything_you_always_wanted_t_6.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Walter Jessen of Next Generation Science interviewed me recently, mainly about the Open Laboratory, but also a little bit more about science blogging and Science 2.0.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — In a display of weakness unbecoming a head of state, President Barack Obama concluded remarks to his nation Tuesday by asking a pretend man who lives in the clouds to watch over and guide the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, and may God bless America,” said the clearly insecure president, who, by seeking the aid of an imaginary being who is neither his ancestor nor someone with whom he shares a tangible harmonious relationship, freely admitted that he has little faith in himself and his inept team of jester advisers…

Chemical reactions within your body, besides liberating energy and producing heat, are also emitting small numbers of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"&gt;photons&lt;/a&gt;, elementary particles of light. The glow is strongest in the late afternoon, and around the lower part of your face.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many living creatures, including &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/06/29/fireflies-the-invertebrate-opera/"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt;, jellyfish, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/06/glowing_squid_use_bacterial_flashlights_that_double_as_an_ex.php"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNVaRPZTGwI"&gt;glow-worms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/das4bz"&gt;deep-sea fish&lt;/a&gt;, are known for producing their own light often through the help of bacterial accomplices. But virtually all living things emit some degree of light, albeit so weakly that it's very hard to detect. Our own biological glimmer is a thousand times less intense than the sensitivity of the human eye so our only hope of detecting it is with sophisticated instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what &lt;a href="http://www.tohtech.ac.jp/~elecs/ca/kobayashilab_hp/NewScientist.html"&gt;Masaki Kobayashi&lt;/a&gt; from the Tohoku Institute of Technology has done. Searching for our inner light is usually the province of hippies and new age followers. Kobayashi is neither - he has actually managed to photograph the dim glow of humans using an incredibly sensitive camera, able to detect the dimmest of lights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous cameras took more than an hour to record a decent image but Kobayashi's camera is so sensitive that it can detect light at the level of a single photon. Even so, using it is tricky. The camera needs to be kept at -120 degrees Celsius and sealed in a completely light-tight room. The person being filmed also needs to be in complete darkness, as well as naked and very clean, lest clothing or grime obscure the photons they emit.
&lt;/p&gt;

Like, a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of greens.  Kale, Swiss chard, mustard greens, various cabbages, some stuff I was unable to identify...  You'll be eating greens at least once a week, often two or three times a week, so you'd better find a way of preparing them that you enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cooked kale.  What am I gonna do with this?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSAuWjoe8I/AAAAAAAAACg/-M6AYcmacYA/s1600-h/kale.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:140px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSAuWjoe8I/AAAAAAAAACg/-M6AYcmacYA/s320/kale.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I'm generally fine with just cooking up my greens in a bit of olive oil and garlic, but that tends to get old after awhile, and in any case my wife doesn't care for it that way.  She finds that it's almost impossible to get them seasoned to her liking, i.e. they are either too salty, or else underseasoned and bland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We both enjoy beans and greens quite a bit.  For those that don't know, you just take canned cannellini beans, cook them with the liquid from the can until it starts to thicken, then add your greens and some chicken broth, maybe a little seasoning too, and cook until the greens are done.  It's delicious and filling, but this gets old too if it's your only way of preparing the copious amount of greens that come from a CSA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So last night, faced with some kale that desperately needed to be used up, we set about to find a new way to prepare greens that we both would enjoy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inspired by a recipe we found online for a potato and kale puree, I came up with the dish that follows.  It was a big hit with Mariah, and easy to make too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baked mashed potatoes with chopped kale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 lbs. potatoes, cut into large pieces (peeled or unpeeled, your choice&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;one large bunch coarsely chopped kale, about 3-4 cups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kosher salt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2-3/4 cup milk (whole milk is tastiest, other milk is healthier)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-6 Tbsp butter or oil (more butter is tastier, less is healthier -- duh)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pepper to taste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup freshly shredded Parmesan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mashed potatoes with kale.  You could eat these just the way they are, but why not bake some cheese on top?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSBT0sl8-I/AAAAAAAAACo/AQS09kSRLe0/s1600-h/kale_mashed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:147px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSBT0sl8-I/AAAAAAAAACo/AQS09kSRLe0/s320/kale_mashed.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Bring two pots of aggressively salted&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; water to a boil.  Place kale in one, potatoes in the other.  Drain kale when it is tender, about 5-10 minutes.  Drain potatoes when they are soft enough to rice/mash, about 15 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finely chop cooked kale.  Pass potatoes through a ricer, or mash with potato masher or wooden spoon.  Combine potatoes, kale, milk, and butter or oil in medium bowl.  Do not overstir, or your potatoes will become gluey.  Add pepper to taste, possibly salt if necessary -- check first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="250" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:250px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;The finished product.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSCfXfDXYI/AAAAAAAAAC4/0SCQei9Xi2Y/s1600-h/finished_kalemashed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:250px;height:155px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSCfXfDXYI/AAAAAAAAAC4/0SCQei9Xi2Y/s320/finished_kalemashed.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Transfer potato and kale mixture to a casserole dish and cover top with parmesan.  Place uncovered in oven and bake until cheese on top just begins to show some brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;You may have heard that it is healthier to leave your potatoes unpeeled.  This is a myth.  While it is true that the skin is much more nutrient-dense than the flesh of the potato, think about it: the skin is paper-thin, while the flesh makes up something like 99+% of the potato.  Sure, the skin is healthier, but do you think it is one hundred times as rich in nutrients?  Nuh uh.  Now, my family happens to prefer mashed potatoes with the skins, because of the rustic texture and earthy flavor.  But if you don't care for it, don't feel compelled to leave them in for the nutrients.  The nutritional benefit is insignificant.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="210" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:210px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Juniper wants to help!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSEpH7e8_I/AAAAAAAAADI/vnQSLy1NY5c/s1600-h/juniper_helping.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:210px;height:160px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSEpH7e8_I/AAAAAAAAADI/vnQSLy1NY5c/s320/juniper_helping.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;When you are boiling potatoes, cooking pasta, or boiling greens, salt the shit out of the water.  Seriously.  In my experience, the amount of salt the food absorbs is relatively independent of the salinity of the water, I think because it can only absorb salt so fast regardless of the concentration.  Too little salt and your food will be underflavored.  Too much salt, and... well, you can't really put in too much salt.  I guess if you made like a brine or something, that might be too much salt.  But don't worry about it.  Put in what you think is enough salt, then put in some more just to be safe.  You'll be glad you did.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To give credit where credit is due, I get the proportions I use for mashed potatoes from Alice Waters' book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Simple-Food-Delicious-Revolution/dp/0307336794"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Art of Simple Food&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the main course, we had barbecue-flavored pan-seared chicken thighs.  This is a recipe Mariah came up with.  It's nothing fancy, but doing it this way will give you very tender flavorful chicken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pan-seared barbecue chicken thighs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 lb. boneless skinless chicken thighs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;your favorite barbecue sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp olive oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;salt and pepper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Place chicken in shallow dish or bowl.  Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper, then coat with barbecue sauce.  Let sit 15 minutes to an hour (if longer than 20 minutes or so, put it in the fridge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mmm, this chicken looks done.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSDZuvYvpI/AAAAAAAAADA/3fw8Fth27SY/s1600-h/chicken.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:145px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SmSDZuvYvpI/AAAAAAAAADA/3fw8Fth27SY/s320/chicken.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Thoroughly heat heavy skillet&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over medium-high heat.  Add olive oil, then chicken.  Cook until barbecue sauce starts to carmelize, about 3-5 minutes, then turn over and repeat process on the other side.  The &lt;a href="http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/fttcook.html"&gt;FDA would like you&lt;/a&gt; to use a meat thermometer to verify that the internal temperature of the chicken is at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.  The nice thing about this recipe, though, is that in my experience, when it looks done on the outside, it's just right on the inside.  Alternatively, cut into one piece and check it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;I use a cast-iron skillet for this, but be warned:  It makes quite a mess, and I am pretty sure that the tomato and other acids in the barbecue sauce is bad for your cast-iron unless it is really well-seasoned.  If you have a ceramic-coated cast-iron skillet, that's probably ideal.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; My wife has pointed out the the chicken thighs we buy are the organic free-range boneless skinless thighs from Wegmans, which may be somewhat smaller than conventional chicken thighs.  My comment about "when it looks done, it is done" &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; applies if your chicken thighs are the same size as the ones I buy... so be warned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-7409311031511837377?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248101811073"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=5588">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5066319e6dc6c9e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Adulthood"/><category term="Drama"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Family"/><category term="autism"/><category term="communication"/><category term="fights"/><category term="teeth"/><title type="html">Fight Club (continued)</title><published>2009-07-20T14:46:22Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T14:46:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/fight-club-continued/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, I fired remarks, I shut myself in the bedroom, I cried. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likely the wrong tack to take with Jeff, who dislikes being fired at, but teeth are a sensitive issue for me. “OK,” I said. “Let me look it up.” I don’t know why this didn’t settle things, but he didn’t want me to do any looking around online, and I felt only a little Google search would put my fears to rest. I became even angrier and more miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, when he wasn’t looking, I did look and came across&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ada.org/public/topics/tooth_eruption.asp"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which says that permanent teeth finish erupting by age 12 or 13. I felt better and apologized (sort of) but it didn’t seem to take.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were left feeling misunderstood and ill-treated, yelled at for no good reason except that the utter lack of communication — from Alex, and between us — was to blame for all misunderstanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t have any of Alex’s baby teeth. Alex didn’t tell us his tooth was loose — but after it came out he was happy and excited and maybe a little frightened. We got a flashlight and showed him how to put one finger inside his lip so he could get a better look at the missing tooth. Three days later he still gets the flashlight and looks at the hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite quote from this video comes at the end:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This web site is a conglomeration of radial marxist leftists and gayz and radial gays and lesbians.  They are the founders of it, and the are really mad at Congresswoman Bachman for having the audacity to say "No, you are not going to get same sex benefits, you are not goimg to have gay marriage in Minnesota, I'm going to try to fight that" and for that she is deemed a clear and present danger to their particular assault on Western tradition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well ... duh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="BPR3" src="http://bpr3.org/images/rbicons/rbicons/ResearchBlogging-Medium-White.png" width="80" height="50"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Any time you've got a whopping big river like the Amazon (or a mountain chain like the Andes, or an ocean, or whatever), you've gotta figure that it will be a biogeographical barrier.  Depending on the kind of organisms, big rivers, high mountains, oceans, forests, deserts, and so on can provide a habitat or a barrier, and when there is a barrier, populations may end up splitting across that barrier and diverging to become novel species.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the big tropical rivers such as the Amazon and the Congo, and the role of rain forests, in certain actual speciation events is pretty clear, but the contribution of these potential barriers to overal species diversity and the general pattern of phylogeny in the wetter tropics is not well understood.  This is because the kind of data needed to measure the effects  of these potential barriers is hard to come by in these habitats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002738"&gt;A new study in PLoS &lt;/a&gt;looks at the role of past climate changes and sea level fluctuations in the rise of new species in the Amazon region.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/eye-of-needle.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black" title="eye of needle" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/eye-of-needle.jpg" alt="eye of needle" width="584" height="348"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by the journalist Amanda Watt after the McCaffery’s suggested she talk to me about the damage being done by the AVN in Australia. Naturally, I was very pleased to be able to furnish Amanda with lots of information about the misinformation and lies spread by my favourite organisation. She has done a great job on the article, especially considering she did not know anything about the anti-vax lobby before writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I only get one quote, the article does a good job of exposing the lies and half-truths perpetuated by the anti-vax lobby in Australia. Amanda also poses the question of why the job of educating the public about the dangers of the anti-vaxer lobby is left to the McCafferys and Australian Skeptics, which is a very good point indeed. Perhaps the government might want to sit up and listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the entire article as a &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/BQW18JUL09VAC_12-171.pdf"&gt;pdf here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Daily Kos is not on my daily hit parade, but after seeing this I might have to make an addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mailer was also correct to point out …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you want to see a good reason to be cautious about a single payer system, read the comments below the article. Imagine all health care being so politicized. And you know who would win over the long term - the proponents of woo who will be there day in and day out promoting coverage of their nonsense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree more with this forecast.  And not only will the promoters of woo be emboldened and legitimized, but in our current times of shrinking health resources, the institutions that ultimately wind up paying for citizen’s health care will look to these relatively-lower-cost alternatives more regularly as legitimate “solutions”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not typically a politically-toned blog, I believe that all voters should call Dennis Kucinich AND your local House Representative and let them know what you think about these amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just his committee that passed this vote, not the final say in the matter, so there is still time to push for rational, practical skepticism to be applied when it comes to the decisions made by our congressfolk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are Dennis Kucinich’s numbers at his two offices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC 20515&lt;br&gt;
(202) 225-5871&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lakewood, Ohio 44107&lt;br&gt;
(216) 228-8850&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="dk" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/dk.jpg" alt="dk" width="93" height="126"&gt;And because history matters, let us not forget that Representative Kucinich has been reported (by multiple sources) as to be a believer in the paranormal, especially belief in alien visitations. Things take a much more serious tone to think that people who are pre-disposed to this kind of thinking are also making policy regarding our health care decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

My mother would be sure that we were well-groomed and that our clothes matched.  We got our pictures taken against the same blue background every year and then my mother would send wallet-sized prints to our family members.  My school pictures are horribly, horribly uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I am thrilled to have found a site that pays tribute to all of the children talented enough to talk their mothers into letting them get the laser background in their school pictures.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por ejemplo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/because_its_monday_and_we_both/Laser%20pic.jpg" alt="Laser pic.jpg" height="700" width="500"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.laserportraits.net/post/143524789/ahh-ill-leave-it-to-phil-to-summarize-this"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: The sites caption reads: &amp;quot;Lasers + Calculator watch + cheesy sweater/collar combo = more awesomeness than one photo can contain...&amp;quot;   I agree. It&amp;#39;s really the calculator watch that melts my heart.  That would have made him a studly, studly dude back in Isis&amp;#39;s day and a real catch.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go check out &lt;a href="http://www.laserportraits.net/"&gt;We Have Lasers&lt;/a&gt;.  I have to imagine that even though my parents were totally lame, there is at least one of you with a laser portrait hanging around.....&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tried again this week.  Once again, &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/blogs/books/2009/07/a-note-to-atheists-before-they-attempt-to-refute-christianity-18/"&gt;he failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So here are my top three pet peeves when it comes to atheist assumptions about Christian beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, atheists often assume that Christians are committed to one specific concept of biblical inspiration and inerrancy, namely the kind that can be summarized as follows: “the Bible says it; I believe it; that settles it”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamentalists who treat the Bible as inerrant are the biggest problem.  They’re usually the ones who ruin science education and end up getting elected to public office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those Christians may not believe in a 6,000-year-old Earth or a literal Adam and Eve, but they’re just as guilty when it comes to pushing pro-Christian government policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our anger is also directed at liberal Christians who may not subscribe to conservatives policies either.  They promote prayer and the idea of Heaven and the notion that Jesus died for others’ sins.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all superstition and it’s all nonsense, regardless of what form it comes in.  We’ll go after irrationality however Christians want to offer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Second, atheists commonly assume that Christians are committed to the most restricted conception of salvation, namely that only those who verbally assent to the proposition “Jesus is Lord” will be saved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reality is that some Christians are inclusivists, accepting that many who never hear let alone assent to the proposition “Jesus is Lord” will be saved. And one Christian trajectory (which has existed since at least the third century) is universalistic, affirming that all will be saved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a pet peeve?  What the heck does it matter?  No one’s getting saved, anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s like me saying you lump all of us as “atheists” when we’re really atheists, humanists, Brights, and skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be a big deal within our own ranks, but no one who believes in God gives two shits what we call ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Finally, atheists assume that Christians are committed to one particular conception of God’s action in the world, namely one in which God occasionally overrides (and thereby violates) natural law to actualize a miracle. Again, that is but one view. There are literally dozens of conceptions of God’s divine action that range from the view that God causes everything to the view that God causes nothing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By my count, we’ve accused theists of believing in a god who &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/05/29/the-problem-with-miracles/"&gt;performs miracles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/30/a-pz-myers-led-tour-of-the-creation-museum/"&gt;created the world&lt;/a&gt;, hates &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/08/what-does-a-homosexual-demon-look-like/"&gt;gay sex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/19/jimmy-carter-severs-ties-with-southern-baptists-over-gender-equality-issues/"&gt;subjugates women&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/13/pharmacists-must-dispense-plan-b/"&gt;despises contraceptives&lt;/a&gt;, and whose followers now appear in &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/18/the-virgin-marys-full-of-crap-wait-reverse-that/"&gt;bird crap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most of those are just from the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God does all sorts of stuff… that he doesn’t actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All this is common knowledge among academic theologians, but is rare knowledge indeed among atheists. How should we explain this? In some cases that I know personally this is explained by the fact that certain atheists had a bad experience at church when a youngster or teenager, and never progressed beyond the level of Sunday school theology.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear something a theologian has to say about a god that is different from “Sunday school theology” that would actually change how atheists think about god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know no more about god that any random churchgoer.  They just know how to phrase their thoughts using bigger words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we get the most ironic comment of them all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Be that as it may, my earnest appeal to atheists would be this: if you care enough about Christianity to refute it as thoroughly as you purport to do, then don’t be content with a mere caricature based on a faded memory of bad Sunday school experiences. Read the full range of academic and popular theology first so as to understand what Christians really believe. &lt;strong&gt;And leave the straw man to the Wizard of Oz&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right back at you, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add one additional thought: The reason atheists attack Rauser’s “primitive” form of Christianity is because that is indeed what most Christians believe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Christians aren’t as “sophisticated” as Rauser seems to think he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, Christians believe in a god who listens to prayers, watches over us, created the world and the creatures inside of it, loves us all, and who we will meet in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m certain they’re wrong about every one of those beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the theologians discredit all of those ideas?  Then, I might be interested in what they have to say.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/blog/57"&gt;more by DeeTee here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the H1N1 swine flu pandemic gathers pace, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8158468.stm"&gt;with 29 deaths to date&lt;/a&gt;, the attitude of the public seems to vary from rank indifference to blind panic. This view is reflected within my own hospital, where news of a possible flu admission is greeted by some staff saying "so what?" while others demand the equivalent of a biological "hazmat" suit before they get within a mile of a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the intriguing aspects has been the poor grasp people have on how quickly epidemics can evolve and what factors can influence this. Having spent some time recently reminding myself about the mathematics behind the spread of epidemics, I thought it would be a good idea to highlight some of the underlying principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reproductive Numbers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of spread of any infection such as flu depends on how "contagious" the virus is. For an infection to spread within a population, an infected person has to pass it on to at least one other person. Depending on its degree of infectiousness, each infection may be allocated a number indicating its likelihood of spreading rapidly, representing the number of people on average who will be infected by one other case. This is known as the Reproductive Number, signified mathematically as R0. If an infection has an R0 of greater than 1, it will spread exponentially and become an outbreak or epidemic, but if it is less than 1, it will soon die out (hence the old adage that 1 is the most important number in epidemiology). But Reproductive Numbers can be variable, and are also situation specific (e.g. it will be higher in a children’s playgroup in Birmingham than in a rural Scottish village). The R0 for influenza is estimated to be between 1.5 and 3, and around 2 on average (by comparison the R0 for measles is around 15, and polio around 12, indicating their higher potential for spread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t think flu having an R0 of 2 is good news. A useful analogy for the transmission of an infection like flu through a population is the spread of gossip. Let’s imagine you have a unique bit of gossip; perhaps you know that a well-known local celebrity has got secretly engaged and you just cannot resist telling a couple of acquaintances. If they each tell 2 other people, you can see the starting of an epidemic of gossip (with R0 = 2). If the gossip is passed on every hour (although with texting and twitter, it would probably travel further and faster), how many people might have heard the gossip within a day? This question formed the basis of a scenario I ran by some non-clinical colleagues at work recently. Their answers ranged from a paltry "150" to an impressive-sounding "Ten thousand".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what if your gossip was not quite as juicy, and it only infects only one other person on average (R0 = 1)? Perhaps to get your news onto the grapevine you wish to give it a boost, by emailing it to 200 people in the company. After 24 hours, which method/infection type will have resulted in the most infections? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those I asked indicated that this second situation would result in the most infections. In fact the gossip with R0 of 1, despite getting a big kick-start, can only infect a possible maximum of 4800 people. (200+200+200 and so on for 24 generations).  However, the gossip with an R0 of 2 will have infected a gob-smacking 33,554,430 people, or over half the population of Britain (2+4+8+16+32+64 and so on for 24 generations). Any potential bioterrorists reading this please take note: You can efficiently generate a globally-devastating epidemic by infecting just a couple of people with a pathogen with a high R0. There is no need to contrive a massive release of biological agents by detonating germ-filled explosives in the skies over New York or in the Paris Metro. (Movie producers, feel free to ignore this tip and continue doing what you always do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice however, epidemics of infection often quickly run out of steam, even if they have a high R0. Clearly you are unlikely to infect over 33 million people with your tittle-tattle of celebrity gossip. The obvious flaw lies in the fact that after a few generations it will be hard to find someone in the localised population who has not already heard the gossip, so they cannot be "infected" anew, and the further spread of gossip will cease, and the epidemic collapses. (Some of you will also realise this is the reason why moneymaking scams like pyramid selling and ponzi schemes will all fail within a short time of being created). The gossip’s R0 starts out as 2, but then drops as there are fewer and fewer people to potentially infect anew, and once the R0 drops below one, the epidemic burns itself out unless new vulnerable populations continue to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1927 a mathematical model of epidemics was devised by Kermack and McKendrick. This supposes there are 3 classes of individuals, namely those who are susceptible (S), those who are infected (I), and those who are recovered (i.e immune)(R). This is the SIR "compartment" model (and unfortunately further exploration of it requires differential equations beyond my understanding, so my foray into it must come to a grinding halt). It is sometimes adapted to SEIR, for Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered, for infections where there is a significant latent period between infection taking place and the ability to infect. For those of you interested in the background to compartmental modelling, there is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology"&gt;a good overview on wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unfeasible as the gossip scenario for flu might seem in practice, it does illustrate the potential infections have to spread explosively. Various estimates are that half the UK population could still get swine flu, so is the gossip analogy valid and what does it tell us about real infections? Could they eventually infect millions of people in the same way? The answer is yes, but there are many other factors at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the analogy to look at some of these. You tell two work colleagues your celebrity gossip. One of your friends tells her manager, and later on the other friend tells some of the staff in accounts. The epidemic is under way. However, within a day or two, you find that most of the staff in your company have heard the news. They are no longer susceptible, having become "immune" through already having been exposed to the gossip previously. These individuals are like the real-world examples of those who have recovered from an infection. According to the SEIR model, they are "recovered" and are now immune to catching it again, and will not pass it on even if re-exposed, and the pool of "susceptibles" has declined rapidly. Some of the people hearing the gossip could also be regarded to be  "immune" because although exposed to your gossip, they couldn’t care less about it, don’t give it a second thought and wouldn’t dream of telling someone else. These are the equivalent of people who have been immunised by vaccination. An important point to remember is that not everyone in the company will hear your news. Perhaps the cleaners who only come in at night or the staff who work in the post room remain blissfully unaware of it because they fortuitously avoided coming into contact with anyone who was infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Herd Immunity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gossip analogy is useful to explain the dynamics of other aspects of an outbreak, like the protection afforded by herd immunity. Let’s say someone visits your company from head office a few days later. A bit behind the times, he mentions the celebrity engagement by way of conversation. But by now this is old news in your workplace, the 3 people he tells it to are already immune, having already heard the gossip the previous week and they don’t bother mentioning it to anyone else. This is herd immunity at work. A sufficiently large proportion of the people in your company have been immunised to such a degree that new infections will not be able to spread easily. They make up a protective "herd", and the still susceptible cleaners (even now they have switched to the day shift) will never get to hear the gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generation Time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial factor that determines the rapidity of spread of an infection is the “Generation Time” (Tg), or the interval it takes between one individual becoming infected and passing it on to the next. Some infections will spread more rapidly than others, even though they have a similar R0, just because they have a shorter generation time. For example, the 1918 pandemic influenza strain had an R0 of around 2, which is about the same as does HIV. The difference is that the generation time for flu is only about 2-3 days, whereas for HIV it is many months, and often several years. This explains why flu pandemics seem to zip around the globe, while the HIV pandemic has chugged along at a relatively sedate snail pace. (Bioterrorists take note once more: Choose an agent with a short generation time as well as a high R0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calculation of susceptibles versus protected/immunes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a simple and useful formula for calculating the number of people in a population who need to be “susceptible” before an outbreak or epidemic is likely. This is most often used to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population that needs to be immunised in order to avert outbreaks. If the proportion of immune people in the population drops below 1-1/ R0, then outbreaks are likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For measles, 1-1/ R0 is 1-1/15 (or 93.3%), hence the advice that we need measles vaccination rates of 90%-95% to avoid outbreaks. For influenza, 1-1/R0 is 1-1/2, or 50%. So if half the population is immune from having had the swine flu before or because they are vaccinated, a major epidemic is unlikely. Obviously with the current swine flu epidemic, there are very few who are immune to H1N1 (which last touched our shores in 1957) and as yet there is no vaccine, so the epidemic would appear to be unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategies for Management.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of epidemics tells us something about how they are best managed. Initially in the UK, the plan was one of containment, where any suspected cases who had travelled to the UK from Mexico or the USA would be isolated, treated and all close contacts given antivirals to prevent them being infected. This it was hoped would contain the epidemic by rendering the R0 &amp;lt;1 and reducing spread. Unfortunately, once widespread onward transmission took place in the general population, this ring-fencing became impracticable, and the shift is now towards treatment and isolation of cases only as they occur. Some estimates indicate that if the R0 for influenza were less than 1.6, then a system of isolation and targeted antivirals would be successful. The fact that this has not succeeded with swine flu indicates its R0 is greater than this, and more likely to be around 2, as for the 1918 H1N1 epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematics here involves not just R0, which is the most relevant factor, but also latent periods, infectious periods and generation times, which are again is too complex to delve into here. A good overview of the influence of these can be &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1181873"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections are fascinating. One of their most intriguing and unique qualities is their ability to spread, often explosively, causing major epidemics of disease or pandemics. Infections have helped shape evolution, history and civilisation, and have ranged from the biblical plagues of antiquity to the more modern global devastations wrought by malaria and AIDS. People usually don’t give more than a passing thought to the historical relevance or consequenses of infection, but occasionally this apathy is punctured by episodes of sheer panic, as is currently happening with swine flu. If nothing else, I hope this blogpost has given food for thought, and hopefully not resulted in even greater concern about the consequenses of swine flu, which fortunately does not seem to be any more lethal than the usual outbreaks of seasonal influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do agree that there are some people who could be said to believe in unbelief with a dogmatic and manifest sort of conviction: we even have words for them, such as “knee-jerk atheists”. There are people who will take what they imagine to be the atheist stance on any possible issue and will never be civil or thoughtful, even when dealing with the most liberal (and possibly non-literal) religionists (and I do agree that some are all-too-quick to accuse others of bad faith). . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe that religion should be challenged publicly, and I’m frankly amazed at the suggestion that nothing turns on the question of whether the epistemic content of the various religions is actually correct. Much, very much, turns on it. The Catholic Church and other religious organisations claim to be in a position to speak with great epistemic and moral authority. This enables them to pronounce in public on all sorts of issues, including abortion rights, censorship, gay rights, stem-cell research, IVF, and on and on. I can think of no more important issue for public consideration than whether or not these organisations really do possess the epistemic and moral authority that they claim – and which politicians and journalists are all too ready to assume they actually have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/07/faithiests.html"&gt;mini-kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt; about the new word “faitheist.”  Ironically, the faitheists themselves are using their moniker to prove that we’re uncivil.&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/blog/57"&gt;more by DeeTee here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the H1N1 swine flu pandemic gathers pace, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8158468.stm"&gt;with 29 deaths to date&lt;/a&gt;, the attitude of the public seems to vary from rank indifference to blind panic. This view is reflected within my own hospital, where news of a possible flu admission is greeted by some staff saying "so what?" while others demand the equivalent of a biological "hazmat" suit before they get within a mile of a case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the intriguing aspects has been the poor grasp people have on how quickly epidemics can evolve and what factors can influence this. Having spent some time recently reminding myself about the mathematics behind the spread of epidemics, I thought it would be a good idea to highlight some of the underlying principles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reproductive Numbers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extent of spread of any infection such as flu depends on how "contagious" the virus is. For an infection to spread within a population, an infected person has to pass it on to at least one other person. Depending on its degree of infectiousness, each infection may be allocated a number indicating its likelihood of spreading rapidly, representing the number of people on average who will be infected by one other case. This is known as the Reproductive Number, signified mathematically as R0. If an infection has an R0 of greater than 1, it will spread exponentially and become an outbreak or epidemic, but if it is less than 1, it will soon die out (hence the old adage that 1 is the most important number in epidemiology). But Reproductive Numbers can be variable, and are also situation specific (e.g. it will be higher in a children’s playgroup in Birmingham than in a rural Scottish village). The R0 for influenza is estimated to be between 1.5 and 3, and around 2 on average (by comparison the R0 for measles is around 15, and polio around 12, indicating their higher potential for spread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t think flu having an R0 of 2 is good news. A useful analogy for the transmission of an infection like flu through a population is the spread of gossip. Let’s imagine you have a unique bit of gossip; perhaps you know that a well-known local celebrity has got secretly engaged and you just cannot resist telling a couple of acquaintances. If they each tell 2 other people, you can see the starting of an epidemic of gossip (with R0 = 2). If the gossip is passed on every hour (although with texting and twitter, it would probably travel further and faster), how many people might have heard the gossip within a day? This question formed the basis of a scenario I ran by some non-clinical colleagues at work recently. Their answers ranged from a paltry "150" to an impressive-sounding "Ten thousand".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what if your gossip was not quite as juicy, and it only infects only one other person on average (R0 = 1)? Perhaps to get your news onto the grapevine you wish to give it a boost, by emailing it to 200 people in the company. After 24 hours, which method/infection type will have resulted in the most infections? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of those I asked indicated that this second situation would result in the most infections. In fact the gossip with R0 of 1, despite getting a big kick-start, can only infect a possible maximum of 4800 people. (200+200+200 and so on for 24 generations).  However, the gossip with an R0 of 2 will have infected a gob-smacking 33,554,430 people, or over half the population of Britain (2+4+8+16+32+64 and so on for 24 generations). Any potential bioterrorists reading this please take note: You can efficiently generate a globally-devastating epidemic by infecting just a couple of people with a pathogen with a high R0. There is no need to contrive a massive release of biological agents by detonating germ-filled explosives in the skies over New York or in the Paris Metro. (Movie producers, feel free to ignore this tip and continue doing what you always do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice however, epidemics of infection often quickly run out of steam, even if they have a high R0. Clearly you are unlikely to infect over 33 million people with your tittle-tattle of celebrity gossip. The obvious flaw lies in the fact that after a few generations it will be hard to find someone in the localised population who has not already heard the gossip, so they cannot be "infected" anew, and the further spread of gossip will cease, and the epidemic collapses. (Some of you will also realise this is the reason why moneymaking scams like pyramid selling and ponzi schemes will all fail within a short time of being created). The gossip’s R0 starts out as 2, but then drops as there are fewer and fewer people to potentially infect anew, and once the R0 drops below one, the epidemic burns itself out unless new vulnerable populations continue to be infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1927 a mathematical model of epidemics was devised by Kermack and McKendrick. This supposes there are 3 classes of individuals, namely those who are susceptible (S), those who are infected (I), and those who are recovered (i.e immune)(R). This is the SIR "compartment" model (and unfortunately further exploration of it requires differential equations beyond my understanding, so my foray into it must come to a grinding halt). It is sometimes adapted to SEIR, for Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered, for infections where there is a significant latent period between infection taking place and the ability to infect. For those of you interested in the background to compartmental modelling, there is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology"&gt;a good overview on wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As unfeasible as the gossip scenario for flu might seem in practice, it does illustrate the potential infections have to spread explosively. Various estimates are that half the UK population could still get swine flu, so is the gossip analogy valid and what does it tell us about real infections? Could they eventually infect millions of people in the same way? The answer is yes, but there are many other factors at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the analogy to look at some of these. You tell two work colleagues your celebrity gossip. One of your friends tells her manager, and later on the other friend tells some of the staff in accounts. The epidemic is under way. However, within a day or two, you find that most of the staff in your company have heard the news. They are no longer susceptible, having become "immune" through already having been exposed to the gossip previously. These individuals are like the real-world examples of those who have recovered from an infection. According to the SEIR model, they are "recovered" and are now immune to catching it again, and will not pass it on even if re-exposed, and the pool of "susceptibles" has declined rapidly. Some of the people hearing the gossip could also be regarded to be  "immune" because although exposed to your gossip, they couldn’t care less about it, don’t give it a second thought and wouldn’t dream of telling someone else. These are the equivalent of people who have been immunised by vaccination. An important point to remember is that not everyone in the company will hear your news. Perhaps the cleaners who only come in at night or the staff who work in the post room remain blissfully unaware of it because they fortuitously avoided coming into contact with anyone who was infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Herd Immunity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gossip analogy is useful to explain the dynamics of other aspects of an outbreak, like the protection afforded by herd immunity. Let’s say someone visits your company from head office a few days later. A bit behind the times, he mentions the celebrity engagement by way of conversation. But by now this is old news in your workplace, the 3 people he tells it to are already immune, having already heard the gossip the previous week and they don’t bother mentioning it to anyone else. This is herd immunity at work. A sufficiently large proportion of the people in your company have been immunised to such a degree that new infections will not be able to spread easily. They make up a protective "herd", and the still susceptible cleaners (even now they have switched to the day shift) will never get to hear the gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Generation Time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial factor that determines the rapidity of spread of an infection is the “Generation Time” (Tg), or the interval it takes between one individual becoming infected and passing it on to the next. Some infections will spread more rapidly than others, even though they have a similar R0, just because they have a shorter generation time. For example, the 1918 pandemic influenza strain had an R0 of around 2, which is about the same as does HIV. The difference is that the generation time for flu is only about 2-3 days, whereas for HIV it is many months, and often several years. This explains why flu pandemics seem to zip around the globe, while the HIV pandemic has chugged along at a relatively sedate snail pace. (Bioterrorists take note once more: Choose an agent with a short generation time as well as a high R0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calculation of susceptibles versus protected/immunes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a simple and useful formula for calculating the number of people in a population who need to be “susceptible” before an outbreak or epidemic is likely. This is most often used to estimate the proportion of the susceptible population that needs to be immunised in order to avert outbreaks. If the proportion of immune people in the population drops below 1-1/ R0, then outbreaks are likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For measles, 1-1/ R0 is 1-1/15 (or 93.3%), hence the advice that we need measles vaccination rates of 90%-95% to avoid outbreaks. For influenza, 1-1/R0 is 1-1/2, or 50%. So if half the population is immune from having had the swine flu before or because they are vaccinated, a major epidemic is unlikely. Obviously with the current swine flu epidemic, there are very few who are immune to H1N1 (which last touched our shores in 1957) and as yet there is no vaccine, so the epidemic would appear to be unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategies for Management.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of epidemics tells us something about how they are best managed. Initially in the UK, the plan was one of containment, where any suspected cases who had travelled to the UK from Mexico or the USA would be isolated, treated and all close contacts given antivirals to prevent them being infected. This it was hoped would contain the epidemic by rendering the R0 &amp;lt;1 and reducing spread. Unfortunately, once widespread onward transmission took place in the general population, this ring-fencing became impracticable, and the shift is now towards treatment and isolation of cases only as they occur. Some estimates indicate that if the R0 for influenza were less than 1.6, then a system of isolation and targeted antivirals would be successful. The fact that this has not succeeded with swine flu indicates its R0 is greater than this, and more likely to be around 2, as for the 1918 H1N1 epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematics here involves not just R0, which is the most relevant factor, but also latent periods, infectious periods and generation times, which are again is too complex to delve into here. A good overview of the influence of these can be &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1181873"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections are fascinating. One of their most intriguing and unique qualities is their ability to spread, often explosively, causing major epidemics of disease or pandemics. Infections have helped shape evolution, history and civilisation, and have ranged from the biblical plagues of antiquity to the more modern global devastations wrought by malaria and AIDS. People usually don’t give more than a passing thought to the historical relevance or consequenses of infection, but occasionally this apathy is punctured by episodes of sheer panic, as is currently happening with swine flu. If nothing else, I hope this blogpost has given food for thought, and hopefully not resulted in even greater concern about the consequenses of swine flu, which fortunately does not seem to be any more lethal than the usual outbreaks of seasonal influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

Now's the time to get to it and ask some pertinent questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So &lt;a href="http://ca.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/michael-jackson/michael-jackson-obituary.html"&gt;Michael Jackson died&lt;/a&gt;.  The Star then did an entire page piece on whether or not Jackson is &lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/664407"&gt;"going to heaven"&lt;/a&gt;, in which there was this little nugget:&lt;blockquote&gt;God's pity aside, Jackson exhibited behaviour one doesn't expect from the heaven-bound, from his alleged drug addictions to his accused pedophilia. Still, those don't automatically exclude him from paradise, says Chris Seay, the pastor of Ecclesia Houston and president of Ecclesia Bible Society. "We shouldn't be surprised to find someone like Jackson in heaven," he says, calling attention to biblical passages like Matthew 7:21-23. "Jesus makes it most clear that we will all be surprised to see that &lt;b&gt;the beautiful and upstanding people we thought were `locks' for heaven did not make it in, and the people we thought hell was created for might have the largest palace on our golden street&lt;/b&gt;." (emphasis mine)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nice, eh?  Wouldn't that be awesome, to die choking on a Wendy's Taco Salad, then get to Heaven and find the douchebag who beat the shit out of you regularly in high school and who went on to be a drug-abusing, wife-beating, scam-artist scumbag, had a giant golden house and was cock of the walk...so to speak?  Does that sound like any sort of place you'd aspire to go?  Why do people think &lt;a href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2005/12/barbara-walters-heaven.html"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt; is great?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there was this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Jason Poling, the pastor at New Hope Community Church in Pikesville, Maryland, brings up a unique scenario related to Jackson's mental and emotional state. Many conservative evangelicals...believe all children are automatically heaven-bound until they reach the "age of accountability" – an undefined point at which they become responsible for their own choices and morality...What if, Poling asks, Jackson never reached the age of accountability? Jackson was only 8 years old when he began touring with the Jackson 5. From that point on, he lived an increasingly insulated life, one that seemed to strand him in a state of arrested development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Michael Jackson was a 50 year old man when he died.  He had seen the world, he had been married, had obscene amounts of money to spend on whatever he wanted, and he was an iconic figure in music - that is so much more than most adults will ever experience that to say he was, &lt;i&gt;"stuck mentally as an 8 year old"&lt;/i&gt; is insulting to a degree I'm not comfortable insulting.  Is this truly an argument a rational person is making in a discussion so pointless that it should embarrass any human adult?  It's like arguing that Noah's beard was &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; just under a foot in length when he took the animals on the ark - is there any way to add another layer of stupid to the situation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep, count on it:&lt;blockquote&gt;Jason Salamun, pastor at Project Church in Rapid City, South Dakota. "The death of Michael Jackson, and the recent slew of celebrity deaths, has reminded me that the end of this life ends with a comma, not a period, and to live like today's my last day here on earth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;A "comma", eh?  Now how, exactly, does Salamun know that?  He, as Richard Dawkins says, "declares it by fiat."  As I've said before, believing that your life continues on after death in some tangible place with memories saved and deeds to be done, makes what you do "on earth" not so much meaningful because you have an infinite amount of time to make amends.  What if the wife-beating high school douchebag with the great house at 235 St. Peter Avenue meets you after you die and apologizes and buys you a steak frites?  Does that mean that his life "on earth" is erased now and he's a fabulous guy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atheists and other non-believers know, as much as we can, that this is it.  When we're gone, we're gone, and it is precisely that brevity of life that makes our actions carry weight.  Our legacy lives on in our family, friends, and whatever lasting markers we threw to the masses.  Not many people actually &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; Michael Jackson, so to hear self-righteous assholes opine on his life illuminates just how shallow a philosophical wading pool it is in which they dwell.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

On July 20, 1969, at 20:17:40 GMT, human beings landed on an alien world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the moment that the Eagle lander touched down on the surface of the Moon, 40 years ago today. Nearly five hours later, at 02:56:15 GMT on July 21, Neil Armstrong placed his boot in the lunar regolith, planting it firmly into history as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read all about this event and its global and historical impacts all over the web, so I won’t belabor the point here. But the Apollo missions mean something special to me, so forgive me this small indulgence. While the overall significance of the missions is interesting and fun to think about and discuss, the real stories, the ones that sink in, are the personal ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was four when Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins approached the Moon. That’s old enough to form memories of the event, but young enough that those memories are malleable; I have a hard time distinguishing what I actually saw with what I may have seen years later on TV. I seem to vaguely remember sitting on the couch with my family watching the events unfold; even at that age I was in love with science fiction and all things spacey. It’s possible my parents let me stay up late to watch that first step. It would’ve been 11:00 p.m. at our old home. But honestly, I don’t remember. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just a wee bit over two years later that changed. In July 1971, my parents rented a Winnebago — a monstrous recreational vehicle — and the whole family piled in so we could road trip down to Cape Canaveral. If all went according to plan, we would be there in time to watch Apollo 15 launch and make its way to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was six, so I remember this much better. The bathroom on the RV smelled overwhelmingly like fruit. My sister taught me that it’s OK to lie when you say something if you cross your fingers while saying it. We stopped to visit friends of my mom’s in South Carolina, and again in Georgia so my oldest brother could check out the Georgia Tech campus before applying there the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lots of other memories that are trivial to others but which I cherish. But still and all, we finally reached Kennedy Space Center. I remember touring the area, and I also remember being on the tour bus and getting up pretty close to the Saturn V. I wonder now if that’s a distorted memory; it’s hard to imagine they let tourists get as close as my semi-fuzzy recollection indicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the day arrived. We parked on the banks of the Banana River and waited for the moment. I wandered off a bit to play on my own (times were different then), and I distinctly remember finding a blue plastic kiddie pool upside down on the river bank. I flipped it over, and a billion mosquitoes exploded out of it! Not too surprisingly, that’s one of the stronger memories I have from that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the moment finally arrived. I remember nothing of the countdown, but boy oh boy do I remember the launch. A man next to me had a camera that he was frantically snapping away with; I remember the noise of the shutter and him winding it, trying to keep up with the rocket lifting off into the sky miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can still picture the mighty Saturn V as it punched upward. It was magnificent, and even at the age of six I had some idea of what this all meant. I stood there, clutching the little scale model rocket my parents bought me on the KSC tour in one hand, and the blue plastic figurine of an Apollo astronaut standing on the Moon I had in the other. I still remember bringing that plastic model to school for show-and-tell when we got back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That memory of the launch is a powerful one for me even today, all these years later. I asked my dad years later what motivated him and mom to pack the whole family up into that RV and take us down there. He replied that it was something he thought we should all see. It was history being made in front of us, and not something you get a chance to see very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him that for another reason. My father was a quality control engineer, and did a lot of government contract work. In fact — and this makes me proud, let me tell ya — he worked on the quality control for the astronauts’ food program. I don’t know what precisely he did for the program, to be honest, but he was involved for some time. I know he did some work on the packaging, including the freeze-dried food and the spaghetti the astronauts took with them. That’s why I asked him why we went to see the launch; I wondered if it was because the trip was work-related for him. But it wasn’t. He and mom wanted to share with us the sheer joy and wonder of humanity’s first tentative journey away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should all strive to be such people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, when my father died, my mom asked all us kids if we wanted any of his books or other items. I stood in front of his bookshelf, admiring the many texts on codebreaking, mathematics, the history of cryptography. He was fascinated by these topics, and was something of a dabbler in math; a formula he invented is published in the CRC handbook used by grad students across the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes fell on a magazine I hadn’t seen before; it was a 25th anniversary retrospective of Apollo. I opened it up, and to my surprise, found this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3732412432/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2606/3732412432_5e31a6a14c_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Apollo 12 astronaut &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Conrad"&gt;Pete Conrad&lt;/a&gt;, the third man to walk on the Moon. Clearly, dad must’ve met him and talked about the food program. Conrad had a great sense of humor, and signed the picture appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad was a major reason I’m a scientist now, and helped instill in me and all my siblings a love of science and space. My memories of Apollo are inextricably entangled with memories of my father from back then too. So to me, Apollo &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; personal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can take a mental step back and look at the whole picture: what that one small step meant, how it inspired a planet, what NASA did that day, and even how its faltered in many ways since then. But sometimes the real story, the human story, is the first-person account of events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how it plays in my head when I picture that hot July day in 1971, and that mental film is always running when I write about Apollo. It may not be at the forefront of my mind, but it’s there. Even without it I might still be inspired to write what I do. And though I strongly doubt it, I suppose it’s remotely possible that I’d still be where I am today without having had my parents expose me directly to space travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they did. And I’m a better man for having it as a part of me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248095744907"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/marys_monday_metazoan_in_our_b.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0eb4108478bb32dc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Mary's Monday Metazoan: in our backyard</title><published>2009-07-20T13:51:27Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T13:51:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/sIHzz1n0pok/marys_monday_metazoan_in_our_b.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/marys_monday_metazoan_in_our_b.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is not a very good picture, but it's because the subject is very, very shy.

&lt;p&gt;I was very confused and initially dismissed it as a fault with my browser. However, I’m afraid to say, it is true. Somebody did a Google Image search for “Meryl Dorey” and rather than checking that the picture they found was in fact her, they simply popped up a picture of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/I-is-Meryl-Dorey.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border:2px solid black" title="I is Meryl Dorey!" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/I-is-Meryl-Dorey.jpg" alt="I is Meryl Dorey!" width="683" height="487"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my more mischievous friends have suggested this is in fact a good thing, since now I can feasibly  impersonate Meryl at conferences and tell the truth about vaccines! And by that, I mean put an end to the lies and misinformation perpetuated by the AVN. Tempting isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the results of a Google Image search (click on the image for better resolution), and may explain how these people ended up using a picture of me and not the real Meryl Dorey. I wonder, should I be amused or offended? Hmm..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this by the publication of a study in BMJ the very day of the Science-Based Medicine Conference a week and a half ago. Unfortunately, between &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amaz!ng Meeting&lt;/a&gt; and other activities, I was too busy to give this study the attention it deserved last Monday. Given the media coverage of the study, which in essence tried to paint mammography screening for breast cancer as being either useless or doing more harm than good, I thought it was imperative for me still to write about it. Better late than never, and I was further prodded by an article that was published late last week in the New York Times about screening for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one aspect of medicine that causes more confusion among the public and even among physicians, I'd be hard-pressed to come up with one more contentious than screening for disease, be it cancer, heart disease, or whatever. The reason is that any screening test is by definition looking for disease in an asymptomatic population, which is very different from looking for a cause of a patient's symptoms. In the latter case, the patient is already being troubled by something that is bothering him. There may or may not be a cause in the form of a disease or syndrome that is responsible for the symptoms, but the very existence of the symptoms clues the physician in that there may be something going on that requires treatment. The doctor can then narrow down range of possibilities for what may be the cause of the patient's symptoms by taking a careful history and physical examination (which will by themselves most often lead to the diagnosis). Diagnostic tests, be they blood tests, X-rays, or other tests, then tend to be more confirmatory of the suspected diagnosis than the main evidence supporting a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, screening for a disease involves subjecting a population, the vast majority of whom don't have the disease and nearly all of whom are asymptomatic, to a diagnostic test in order to find disease before it has begun to cause symptoms. This is very different from the vast majority of diagnostic tests used in medicine, the vast majority of which are done for specific indications. Any test to be contemplated for doing this thus has to meet a very stringent set of requirements. First, it must be safe. Remember, we're subjecting asymptomatic patients to a test, and a risky, invasive tests are rarely going to be worthwhile, except under uncommon circumstances. Second, the disease being screened for must be a disease that is curable or manageable. For instance, it makes little sense to screen for a disease like amyotropic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) because there is very little that can be done for it; diagnosing it a few months or a few years before symptoms appear won't change the ultimate outcome. A corollary to this principle is that acting to treat or manage a disease early, before symptoms appear, should result in a better outcome. I've discussed the phenomenon of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_early_detection_of_cancer_more_compl.php"&gt;lead time bias in depth&lt;/a&gt; before; it's a phenomenon in which earlier diagnosis only makes it seem that survival is longer because it was caught earlier when in reality it progressed at the same rate as it would without treatment. Lead time bias is such an important concept that I'm going to republish the diagram I last used to explain it, because in this case a picture is worth a thousand words:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/overdiagnosis_of_breast_cancer_due_to_ma.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/overdiagnosis_of_breast_cancer_due_to_ma.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/e9EtsvRkaDI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248091912357"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/20/3505/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9964a77ba6e74cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="herbal supplements"/><category term="natural"/><title type="html">Natural Mythology</title><published>2009-07-20T12:05:35Z</published><updated>2009-07-20T12:05:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/20/3505/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more powerful than an idea, and nothing more potentially harmful than a false idea that everyone “knows” is true and therefore does not question. “Natural” remedies are now a multi-billion dollar industry, and it’s not just independent startups but the supplement industry and even pharmaceutical companies are cashing in on the marketing appeal of the word “natural”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Natural Myth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to find a health food product that does not have the word “natural” incorporated into its name, its product labeling, or even the name of the company that manufactured it. Even many common supermarket products will proudly proclaim that they have all natural ingredients. Everyone knows that natural is better than, well, not natural. The problem is, no one can give a good working definition of what natural means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Because of this problem with definition, there is no regulation of the use of the word “natural” in product labeling or advertisement. Any company can therefore call any of their products natural without fear of liability for false advertising. Health food companies are happy with this vagueness of terminology, because they can use the term natural to give their products a mythical sense of goodness without making specific claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will define natural as unprocessed or unaltered. Therefore, a leaf or root or fruit which is consumed without altering it from its harvested form is natural. The difficulty with this definition is that almost all products, whether food, supplement, or medicine, undergo some processing, so where can we objectively draw the line? If you process apples into apple juice, is that apple juice natural? What about wheat into bread, leaves into tea, or coffee beans into coffee? You may try to distinguish mere food preparation from processing, but you will find that again there is no clear line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of processing can be broken down into its different components, such as pulverizing, boiling, leaching, mixing, separating, purifying, etc. All of these processes are used in what we would consider simply cooking, but they are also the components of processing plants into tablets which are then marketed as pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you then abandon the concept of natural meaning unprocessed as not useful and hopelessly confusing, you may alternatively define natural to mean occurring in nature. Here one runs into similar problems, however. The elements out of which all substances are made are, of course, all naturally occurring, therefore it is only meaningful to talk about molecules as natural or artificial. If a molecular substance is purified from among the hundreds which can be found in a particular plant, such as caffeine from coffee beans, is that substance no longer natural? What if it is minimally altered, just adding a couple of atoms to the molecular structure so that it is more easily absorbed into the body, but its biological activity is otherwise unchanged? What about combining two naturally occurring substances together to form a third novel compound? Such processes occur when boiling leaves to make a “natural” herbal tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the difficulty with definition, there is also no compelling reason to think that molecules which occur in nature have any advantage for human wellness over those which are the product of human ingenuity. Most substances naturally occurring in plants, for example, are deadly poisons or will at least make you very sick. Plants contain hundreds of substances; some have minimal biological activity, some are just food. Others have pharmacological effects which are potentially useful if used correctly. Many others contain substances which are toxic to humans even in minute doses, such as arsenic, hemlock, and alkaloid poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substances that can be found in nature are primarily a product of chance, the vagaries of evolution. Plants evolve only to be more successful at surviving in their current environment, not for the benefit of one egocentric mammalian species. They have not been fine-tuned by nature to be good medicines or anything else. Fruit, for example, exists only as a bribe to compel animals into spreading seeds, which is the fruit’s real purpose. The chemical substances that are currently represented in plant or animal biochemistry are therefore purely a result of random chance, not any design serving humans. There is therefore no logical reason to believe that “natural,” by any definition, is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there is no difference in the chemical activity or any properties of a molecule which is extracted from a plant, or a molecule with the same structure that was created in a chemical laboratory atom by atom. There is no experiment that can be conducted, biological or otherwise, to distinguish these two substances, because their properties are solely determined by their chemical structure, not their derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the concept of natural is not a very useful one. It is both difficult to define precisely and, when closely examined, of no real intrinsic value. And yet, it is cited as the greatest single virtue of many alternative therapies. The psychological appeal, however, is obvious. There is a general fear in our culture of technology gone out of control. Toxins and “chemicals” in our environment are blamed almost abstractly for many of our current ills, often without any supporting evidence. Industrial pollutants darken our skies, acidify our rain, poison our waters, and threaten our health. It is no wonder that the idea of getting back to pure nature is so appealing to so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbs are drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbal remedies are enjoying an immense upsurge in popularity. Sales of St. Johns Wort (hypericum), an herb used to treat depression, now exceed those of Prozac in Germany, where the herb is chiefly produced. Its use is now also growing in the U.S., and it has received nothing but good press from the media. It is claimed, without clinical evidence, that the herb works as well as Prozac and other drugs marketed for depression but without the side effects. How is this possible? Because it is all-natural, we are told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction, however, between medicinal herbs and drugs is a false one. A drug is simply defined as any substance which has a physiological effect on the body other than its pure nutritional value. Caffeine is a drug, and so is alcohol. The term drug, however, has taken on a negative connotation, partly because of the recent war on illegal recreational drug use. The health food industry has exploited and increased this negative connotation. They have then offered their herbal remedies as an alternative to drugs. But any herb that has a medicinal effect is, by definition, a drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the pharmaceuticals currently in use by mainstream physicians are substances which are found in plants, or are derivatives of plant substances. Their chemical structure has been identified and analyzed, and every property of the drug that can be known has been investigated. This includes how and where it is absorbed into the system, how long it hangs around (a property called its half-life), where it goes, how it is stored, where and how it is metabolized, and how it is excreted. Also, as much as can be learned about the precise mechanism of action of the substance is investigated, including what tissues it affects, what receptors it binds to, what the side effects are, the signs of toxicity, and how much of the drug would be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of information is obtained in experiments which are called preclinical (or animal-based) and phase I and phase II clinical (or human-based) trials. At this point, the work is just beginning, however. For now a phase III clinical trial must be completed, involving many patients in a double-blind placebo-controlled format to determine if the drug is safe and effective. If this is proven to the FDA’s satisfaction, the drug can then be marketed. Physicians can then prescribe the drugs, and they will have enough information to know exactly what dose to give their patients, what the resulting blood levels will be, how long the effect will last, what the interaction with other drugs will be, what beneficial physiological effect to expect, and what to look out for in terms of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone taking an herb for its alleged medicinal benefits, however, does not have any of this information. The active ingredient, if there is one, is mixed together with many other chemicals, many of which are undesirable. It is impossible to regulate dosing, for there will be tremendous variability from plant to plant, region to region, and season to season, in the exact constitution of the herb. And finally, the effects, toxicity, and other properties of the herb have not been studied in any controlled fashion. This is the worst kind of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the best case scenario, if an herb exists with an active ingredient that has a desired effect with little side effects, this is no guarantee that it will be used properly. Drugs are only useful when they are combined with clinical knowledge and experience so that they can be used intelligently and with understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbal medicinals, like hypericum, are drugs. Some have already been incorporated into mainstream medicine. Others have potential and should be studied properly. The practice of herbal medicine, however, is imprecise, unscientific, and sloppy. It is far more likely to cause harm than good. It is a multi-billion dollar industry, however, that has managed to evade FDA regulation, primarily because of political support due to the popular mystique of “natural” medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade many popular herbal remedies have been tested in large clinical trials. They have not fared well. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15846605?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=1&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;Hypericum for depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437427?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=1&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;echinacea for colds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19160216?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;ginkgo biloba for memory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370565?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;saw palmetto for enlarged prostate&lt;/a&gt; had no effect. If they were actually regulated like drugs, they could not get approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular claim of many alternative remedies is that they are based upon ancient knowledge. The popularity of the idea that an earlier golden era had greater wisdom than our current age is a certain sign of discontent and decline. It is another manifestation of a lack of faith in modern technology to solve the world”s problems. A hundred years ago, the industrial revolution promised to bring about a modern Utopia. This optimism, however, was premature, and today, as a society, we have a much more realistic idea of what technology can and cannot do, and what the costs of technology are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans, however, tend to be diehard optimists. If technology has not delivered all we desire, then some will turn to another solution upon which to place their hopes. This is at least one factor in the current popularity of New Age philosophies. Many New Age gurus have turned to Eastern philosophy and ancient ideas, claiming that modern Western science does not have all the answers. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda are two alternative medicine beneficiaries of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there are those practitioners who even try to have it both ways. Despite the current fad of antirationalism, science still is a greatly respected institution in our culture. Its many successes cannot be denied. A new advertising strategy for alternative therapies is to claim that they are the coming together of ancient wisdom and modern science – the best of both worlds. This claim, however, is just another myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient philosophies of medicine suffer from the fact that they were formulated at a time when virtually nothing was known about human anatomy or physiology, when the fields of genetics, biochemistry, and infectious disease did not even exist. One to three thousand years ago, when TCM and Ayurveda were born, it was not known that the brain was the seat of intelligence, that the heart pumped blood, and no one had any idea what the liver did. It was not even known that specific diseases existed, with their own signs and symptoms, causes, cures, and natural history. People were thought to suffer from their own personal and unique maladies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical systems at this time were based upon philosophies, not science or evidence. Most of the philosophies were based upon spiritual or magical notions, such as the idea of Chi or life force central to TCM. Disease, they believed, was caused by imbalances or blockage of flow in these mystical forces. Equally mystical and fanciful methods, such as acupuncture, were invented to restore balance or unblock flow. The chance of any of these systems developing any truly useful therapies is very close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet proponents of these alternative practices will claim that the fact that they have survived and have been used for so many thousand years is testimony to their success. How could they have survived if they do not work, they argue. But history shows us that this claim is false. The humoral theory of disease, for example, dominated Western medicine for three thousand years. Until the advent of modern scientific medicine, Western doctors diagnosed imbalances in the four humors: blood, phlegm, green bile, and black bile. They treated these imbalances with emetics, cathartics, and blood letting. The utter failure of their treatments did not blunt their acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason why the humoral theory is now dead is because its practitioners in the West changed from philosophy-based medicine to science-based medicine.  No one would advocate a return to the practice of blood letting for the treatment of fevers, but this is equivalent to advocating a return to other outdated philosophies of medicine, such as TCM and Ayurveda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us remember that 100 years of science-based medicine has doubled the human life expectancy from 40 to nearly 80 years. No philosophy-based medicine can make that claim. Three thousand years of TCM, Ayurveda, and the humoral theory added not a single day of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Care Freedom of Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is a cherished virtue, especially in America, the self-proclaimed modern defenders of democracy and freedom. Cries for freedom, therefore, always command our attention and sympathy. Defenders of unscientific medicine have used this fact to their advantage, attempting to portray their battle for acceptance as a fight for freedom. The same defense was used earlier in this century when the creation of the FDA threatened to put Mom and Pop snake oil producers out of business. Fortunately for the American public, it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the debate about freedom of choice, however, is a deliberate misdirection. Mainstream physicians are strong supporters of patient”s rights, including their freedom to choose their health care providers, and to make all decisions regarding their care. There are those, however, who would try to confuse this freedom with the freedom of charlatans to practice fraud. No one should be free to present themselves as competent clinicians when they are not, or to offer the public remedies that have not met minimal standards of safety and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, defenders will argue that patients can read the labels, examine the evidence, and make informed decisions for themselves about alternative or any health care options. This is simply not realistic, however. Patients cannot and should not be expected to have a medical education in order to protect themselves from potentially harmful or useless treatments. Just as drivers should not be expected to be mechanics in order to ensure that their cars are safe, or engineers in order to ensure that the bridges they drive over will not collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a system in place to ensure that medications, procedures, and devices are safe and effective. There are standards of care and practice guidelines which are based on the best scientific evidence available. Alternative practitioners, however, want to bypass this system in the name of freedom. What they are really defending, however, is their own freedom – their freedom to practice medicine without proper training and without the burden of doing the hard work and careful thinking necessary to practice the best medicine currently possible, or even to ensure that they are not doing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health care freedom movement is really about eliminating the standard of care in order to promote treatments that cannot meet a reasonable standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture has inertia, and unfortunately the “natural” myth has become deeply embedded in our culture. Even a century ago the word “natural” was used to sell useless or even harmful nostrums to the public. But on close inspection it is nothing more than a modern mythology, a comforting lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fact that such groups exist is a major part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, &lt;strong&gt;Rep. Will Tallman&lt;/strong&gt; asked his pastor &lt;strong&gt;Rev. Gerry Stoltzfoos&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09200/984917-454.stm"&gt;deliver a “non-denominational prayer”&lt;/a&gt; to open the House’s legislative session.  Stoltzfoos submitted a draft of the prayer to the House Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“… I wrote it out and sent it to them. They said my prayer was rejected because it contained an offensive word. Just once, in closing, I mentioned Jesus.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true.  The end of the prayer was “In Jesus’ name, Amen.”  Clearly, Stoltzfoos doesn’t understand the meaning of “non-denominational.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of changing the last line of his prayer, he whined and quit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I was incredibly surprised,” he said. “I thought they were kidding. &lt;strong&gt;I had carefully crafted the prayer not to be offensive in any way&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being told he couldn’t use Jesus’ name, the Rev. Stoltzfoos said he decided not to say the prayer at all rather than omit the name of his Lord and Savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“OK, that’s fine, I’m not the guy for this,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prayer’s not offensive at all… unless you’re delivering it to Hindus, Jews, atheists, Muslims, or Tom Cruise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did the Speaker request the change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I think my pastor was protected by the First Amendment, but &lt;strong&gt;[House Speaker] Keith [McCall] thinks he has a legitimate concern about lawsuits” that could be filed over mixing religion with public business&lt;/strong&gt;, Mr. Tallman said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups like &lt;a href="http://au.org"&gt;Americans United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org"&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; didn’t have to lift a finger.  Their mere presence was enough to keep the Pennsylvania House secular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is kicking Jesus out of anything.  The House is just correctly not promoting any one particular belief over another.  To allow one religion’s deity to be glorified would open the floodgates for everyone else (though the PA Senate does allow for this).  McCall made the right call.  His policy works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, a letter from Mr. McCall is sent to prospective guest chaplains, asking them to use “an interfaith, non-denominational prayer” and to refrain from expressing views on legislative, political or governmental issues before or during the prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying “God” or “Father” is permissible in the House, but its officials still don’t want pastors to mention specific religious figures, such as Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha or others.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I find “God” and “Father” to be offensive, too — it’s like saying “the N-word” instead of “nigger” — both mean the same thing, but one is allowed while the other is taboo.  “God” and “Father” are both not-so-subtle ways of letting people like me know I’m not welcome in PA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I guess it’s a small step forward that mentions of specific Gods aren’t allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

Car surfing has caused several people to be killed during the course of such stunts. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The 1985 movie &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Wolf" title="Teen Wolf"&gt;Teen Wolf&lt;/a&gt; was one movie which inspired many young people to try car surfing.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=car%20surfing"&gt;Urban Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; has a more graphic take:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A way to commit suicide by driving a car on a very busy highway/freeway/interstate at a very high speed, setting the car into cruise control and then climbing out of the car through the window and standing on top of the car as if the driver were surfing until the car hits something.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"Some dude in Arizona went car surfing on the freeway and killed himself." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Actually, some dude&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt; [the 55 year old chief financial officer for the city of Phoenix] &lt;/span&gt;did &lt;a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2004/12/06/daily43.html"&gt;die in this manner&lt;/a&gt; in 2004:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Keogh climbed onto the roof of his moving car after setting the cruise control around 50 miles an hour Wednesday afternoon.

A search of newspaper articles reporting car-surfing accidents between June 1998 and June 2008 was conducted using the term “car surfing.” Each article was analyzed for information regarding the motivations behind the car-surfing activity and the circumstances surrounding the accident.   ...  This information was then correlated with the number of car-surfing fatalities identified from FARS &lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;Fatality Analysis Reporting System, national database&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; between 1998 and 2006.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the period 1995-2008, the authors identified 7 patients (11-16 yrs of age) from the local pediatric trauma records in Cleveland, OH as outlined in the table below (click to enlarge).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IA5nokOFh84/SmQlVGS8LJI/AAAAAAAADdg/VvnVrM1uZ3M/s1600-h/car+surfing+injuries.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:400px;height:229px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_IA5nokOFh84/SmQlVGS8LJI/AAAAAAAADdg/VvnVrM1uZ3M/s400/car+surfing+injuries.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;All 7 patients sustained their injuries between the years 2001 and 2008. In 3 of these patients, the mechanism of injury involved surfing on the back trunk of the moving vehicle; these patients accidently fell off as the vehicle braked or accelerated rapidly. Two patients fell from the hood of the vehicle, 1 patient fell from the side of the vehicle, and 1 patient jumped off after surfing on the exterior of the vehicle. All patients sustained their injuries from striking their heads on the pavement. Four patients had a loss of consciousness.  ...  One patient required craniotomy for emergency evacuation of an acute SDH &lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;[subdural hematoma]&lt;/span&gt; ... Four patients suffered long-term neurological complications, including impaired impulse control, emotional instability, chronic headaches, and memory difficulties.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Results of the Lexis-Nexis search did not surprise loyal MTV viewers and gamers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;...the television show &lt;a href="http://www.jackassworld.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jackass&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; the video game &lt;i&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/i&gt;, and the video-sharing website YouTube depict car surfing as a popular activity. These media sources frequently portray car surfing in warm, sunny climates. To estimate whether regional differences in car-surfing fatality rates exist, we analyzed the 8 states with the highest fatality rates related to car surfing: California, Florida, New York, Texas, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. ... The 3 states with the highest number of fatalities during this period of time were California (51 children), Texas (42), and Florida (40)—all states with warm, sunny climates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, Car Surfin' USA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;amp;Cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;amp;Term=%28%28%22automobiles%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D+OR+%22automobiles%22%5BAll+Fields%5D+OR+%22car%22%5BAll+Fields%5D%29+AND+surfing%5BAll+Fields%5D%29+NOT+Karachi%5BAll+Fields%5D"&gt;sizeable literature&lt;/a&gt; on car surfing injuries already exists &lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;[OK, 7 articles in Pubmed].&lt;/span&gt; My favorite is this one by a pair of Belgian forensic experts (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7947342"&gt;Hooft &amp;amp; van de Voorde, 1994&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Reckless behaviour related to the use of MDMA (ecstasy): apropos of a fatal accident during car-surfing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A 26-year-old man died from severe brain contusion after falling from a moving car during an attempt at car-surfing. Toxicological urine screening was positive for amphetamines, the blood analysis revealed a MDMA level of 0.63 mg/l and a blood alcohol concentration of 1.23 g/l. The case is another example of the bizarre and reckless behaviour which may result from the euphorogenic activity of ecstasy and the circumstances in which it is commonly used.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In conclusion, &lt;a href="http://thejns.org/doi/full/10.3171/2009.4.PEDS08474"&gt;Wang et al. (2009)&lt;/a&gt; suggest that appropriate educational materials from health care providers and community leaders should warn of the dangers of car surfing. Media depictions of such stunts should include disclaimers, perhaps like this one:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_IA5nokOFh84/SmQsZCbjEVI/AAAAAAAADds/BS0dUEypyAg/s1600-h/jackass-warning.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:400px;height:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_IA5nokOFh84/SmQsZCbjEVI/AAAAAAAADds/BS0dUEypyAg/s400/jackass-warning.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Footnote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(153,51,153)"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(153,51,153)"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The news article continues:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Phoenix officials said Keogh was suffering from a tropical parasitical disease  he picked up while vacationing in Mexico a few years ago. The disease, unnamed by city officials, recently flared up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a neurological digression, I was curious the tropical brain parasite... could it have been &lt;a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/180/6/639"&gt;neurocysticercosis&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0037-86822008000600029&amp;amp;lng=en&amp;amp;nrm=iso&amp;amp;tlng=en"&gt;Cerebral schistosomiasis mansoni&lt;/a&gt;? A subsequent autopsy, however, &lt;a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-09-29/news/the-mystery-deepens/"&gt;ruled out a parasitic infection&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Keogh was under tremendous pressure at work. He may have been depressed and he may have committed suicide. But the case was declared a &lt;a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2006-12-14/news/jump-street/"&gt;medical mystery&lt;/a&gt; when evidence of brain damage &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; discovered, "consistent with his symptoms being due to an underlying disease process."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hooft PJ, van de Voorde HP.

First, the embryo and neurectoderm are patterned by secreted factors, which establish cell fates among progenitors and then differentiated neurons, encoded by combinations of transcription factors.  The fate or phenotype of each neuron includes the expression of the specific set of ion channels, neurotransmitters and receptors that determine its physiological function.  It also includes expression of a particular repertoire of guidance receptors and surface molecules regulating connectivity, which enable axonal pathfinding and target selection.  The processes that establish connectivity are usually thought of as happening after the fate of neurons and their targets have been established.  This linear paradigm, from patterning to differentiation to connection, has been increasingly challenged by studies from both invertebrate and vertebrate systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of studies have shown that incoming axons can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of their synaptic target cells.  In many cases in fact, the target cells do not even exist at the time that the incoming axons are making their targeting decisions.  In the fly visual system, for example, photoreceptor axons target the developing optic lobe and secrete the morphogen hedgehog, which induces optic lobe progenitor cells to complete a final cell division and undergo neuronal differentiation (Huang and Kunes, 1996).  In addition, secretion of additional signaling molecules induces expression in the optic lobe neurons of adhesion molecules and guidance factors necessary for retinal axons to recognize them as appropriate synaptic targets (Bazigou et al., 2007).  Thus, the final differentiation of cells in the optic lobe requires the prior pathfinding of retinal axons to this area.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A similar situation has been demonstrated in the mammalian brain, where axons from the visual thalamus induce the proliferation and differentiation of the primary visual cortex (Dehay et al., 2001).  Significant patterning of the cortical sheet occurs prior to thalamic axon invasion and directs the guidance of visual thalamic axons to the appropriate part of the cortex (Little et al., 2009).  However, ultimate elaboration of the mature cytoarchitectonic characteristics of primary visual cortex, including its pattern of connectivity with other cortical areas, requires correct innervation by visual thalamic axons.  Though it has not been shown, it seems likely that this kind of hierarchical dependence on afferent innervation might also be crucial in the elaboration of later-maturing higher-order cortical areas, which receive inputs from earlier-maturing areas (Bargary and Mitchell, 2008).    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The linear developmental paradigm must thus be substantially modified to include a highly dynamic interplay between differentiation and establishment of connectivity.  Importantly, a recent study suggests that the influence of this interplay also extends to the maintenance of cell fate in the adult nervous system.  It is well known that many neurons require retrograde neurotrophic support from their target cells to stay alive.   A study from Drosophila (Eade and Allan, 2009) suggests that retrograde signals, in this case involving bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, may also be required to maintain expression of neuronal phenotype in connecting cells, demonstrated through an effect on expression of a specific neuropeptide.  This signaling was shown to require active axonal transport mechanisms.  If this mechanism holds in vertebrates it has several important implications.  First, neuronal phenotypes in the adult nervous system may be more plastic than previously recognised and more actively maintained by regulators of gene expression in response to ongoing retrograde (and possibly anterograde?) signaling.  Second, neurodegenerative disorders involving defects in axonal transport, such as Huntington’s disease, may have their primary effects on neuronal phenotype and physiological function, inducing partial de-differentiation prior to overt degeneration.

I was reminded of this by the publication of a study in BMJ the very day of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=426"&gt;Science-Based Medicine Conference&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half ago. Unfortunately, between &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amaz!ng Meeting&lt;/a&gt; and other activities, I was too busy to give this study the attention it deserved last Monday. Given the media coverage of the study, which in essence tried to paint mammography screening for breast cancer as being either useless or doing more harm than good, I thought it was imperative for me still to write about it. Better late than never, and I was further prodded by an article that was published late last week in the New York Times about screening for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one aspect of medicine that causes more confusion among the public and even among physicians, I’d be hard-pressed to come up with one more contentious than screening for disease, be it cancer, heart disease, or whatever. The reason is that any screening test is by definition looking for disease in an asymptomatic population, which is very different from looking for a cause of a patient’s symptoms. In the latter case, the patient is already being troubled by something that is bothering him. There may or may not be a cause in the form of a disease or syndrome that is responsible for the symptoms, but the very existence of the symptoms clues the physician in that there may be something going on that requires treatment. The doctor can then narrow down range of possibilities for what may be the cause of the patient’s symptoms by taking a careful history and physical examination (which will by themselves most often lead to the diagnosis). Diagnostic tests, be they blood tests, X-rays, or other tests, then tend to be more confirmatory of the suspected diagnosis than the main evidence supporting a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, screening for a disease involves subjecting a population, the vast majority of whom don’t have the disease and nearly all of whom are asymptomatic, to a diagnostic test in order to find disease before it has begun to cause symptoms. This is very different from the vast majority of diagnostic tests used in medicine, the vast majority of which are done for specific indications. Any test to be contemplated for doing this thus has to meet a very stringent set of requirements. First, it must be safe. Remember, we’re subjecting asymptomatic patients to a test, and a risky, invasive tests are rarely going to be worthwhile, except under uncommon circumstances. Second, the disease being screened for must be a disease that is curable or manageable. For instance, it makes little sense to screen for a disease like amyotropic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease) because there is very little that can be done for it; diagnosing it a few months or a few years before symptoms appear won’t change the ultimate outcome. A corollary to this principle is that acting to treat or manage a disease early, before symptoms appear, should result in a better outcome. I’ve discussed the phenomenon of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;lead time bias in depth&lt;/a&gt; before; it’s a phenomenon in which earlier diagnosis only makes it seem that survival is longer because it was caught earlier when in reality it progressed at the same rate as it would without treatment. Lead time bias is such an important concept that I’m going to republish the diagram I last used to explain it, because in this case a picture is worth a thousand words (and who more than I, other than perhaps Kim Atwood, can lay down a thousand words so easily?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/marapr99/primer.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/cancer3.bmp" height="163" width="450" alt="Lead time bias"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another requirement for a screening test is that the disease being screened for must be relatively common. Screening for rare diseases is simply not practical from an economic standpoint, as the vast majority of “positive” test results will be false positives. Another way of saying this is that the specificity of the test must be such that, whatever the prevalence of the disease in the population, it does not produce too many false positives. In other words, for less common diseases the specificity and positive predictive value must be very high (i.e., a “positive” test result must have a very high probability of representing a true positive in which the patient actually does have the disease being tested for and the false negative rate can’t be too high; either that, or screeners must be prepared to do a lot of confirmatory testing for a large number of false positives). For more common diseases, a lower positive predictive value is tolerable. The test must also be sufficiently sensitive that it doesn’t produce too many false negatives. Remember, one potential drawback of a screening program is a false sense of security in patients who have been screened, a drawback that will be increased if a test misses too many patients with disease. Finally, a screening test must also be relatively inexpensive. One of the reasons there is so much controversy over using MRI as a screening test for breast cancer, for example, is because an MRI easily costs over $1,000 per test. In contrast, good, old-fashioned mammography is between 10- and 20-fold less expensive. Consequently, MRI is currently not recommended for breast cancer screening in the general population and is instead reserved for younger women at high risk due to a strong family history or a known mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene, as I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=133"&gt;discussed last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, there has been a bit of a kerfuffle in the literature and in the lay press reporting on the literature regarding the risks and the benefits of various screening tests, including mammography. For example, three weeks ago Harriet &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=543"&gt;wrote about a study&lt;/a&gt; that measured the cumulative rates of false positives from screening tests for prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer and, earlier, about &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=41"&gt;ultrasound screening for prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Prostate cancer, for example, is a particularly difficult disease to screen for because there is such a high incidence of disease that never causes a problem. In autopsy series of men over 80, at least 75% of men have evidence of at least one focus of prostate cancer somewhere in their prostate glands, but obviously it never caused them any problem and they died of something else, including old age. On the other hand, prostate cancer is consistently one of the top cancers in men, resulting in 30,000 deaths a year. Sometimes, it can be quite aggressive. Because we don’t have reliable tests to differentiate prostate cancer that will progress from prostate cancer that will never cause a problem, whenever we find prostate cancer by screening there is always the question of what to do with it, to treat or not to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my specialty is breast cancer, in the wake of the aforementioned New York Times article &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/health/17screening.html"&gt;In Push for Cancer Screening, Limited Benefits&lt;/a&gt; and multiple &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090710/ap_on_he_me/eu_med_breast_cancer_overtreatment_4"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/705886?src=mpnews&amp;amp;spon=7&amp;amp;uac=22684DN"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; about a study that purports to show that 1 in 3 breast cancers detected by mammographic screening are overdiagnosed and overtreated, entitled, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul09_1/b2587"&gt;Overdiagnosis in publicly organised mammography screening programmes: systematic review of incidence trends&lt;/a&gt;. This study was done by Karsten Juhl Jørgensen and Peter C. Gøtzsche at The Nordic Cochrane Centre. Here’s how an AP story described the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONDON –&lt;/strong&gt; One in three breast cancer patients identified in public screening programs may be treated unnecessarily, a new study says. Karsten Jorgensen and Peter Gotzsche of the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen analyzed breast cancer trends at least seven years before and after government-run screening programs for breast cancer started in parts of Australia, Britain, Canada, Norway and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published Friday in the BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal. Jorgensen and Gotzsche did not cite any funding for their study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once screening programs began, more cases of breast cancer were inevitably picked up, the study showed. If a screening program is working, there should also be a drop in the number of advanced cancer cases detected in older women, since their cancers should theoretically have been caught earlier when they were screened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jorgensen and Gotzsche found the national breast cancer screening systems, which usually test women aged between 50 and 69, simply reported thousands more cases than previously identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Jorgensen and Gotzsche found that one third of the women identified as having breast cancer didn’t actually need to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more or less a half way decent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CliffsNotes"&gt;CliffsNotes&lt;/a&gt; version of the study, but let’s look at the study in a bit more detail, because I have–shall we say?–issues about it. First off, it’s important to remember that this is a systematic review. Actually, it is part systematic review, part meta-analysis, which is one reason why I have issues with it. Whether you call it a systematic review or meta-analysis, as a consequence it is highly dependent upon the selection of studies and how the studies are interpreted. I wasn’t encouraged by this statement in the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that many cases of carcinoma in situ in the breast do not develop into potentially lethal invasive disease. In contrast, many find it difficult to accept that screening for breast cancer also leads to overdiagnosis of invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this may be true of certain advocacy groups, the implication seems to be that many physicians also find it “difficult to accept” that screening can lead to overdiagnosis. No evidence is presented to support this little dig, and overall it sets the tone of settling scores. This is not terribly surprising, because these two authors are well known for publishing articles about mammography that absolutely, positively always downplay the benefits of screening mammography and play up the risks, as a couple of quick PubMed searches show (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;amp;cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;amp;term=Gotzsche+mammography"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;amp;cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;amp;term=Jorgensen+mammography"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). They’re also known for writing letters to scientific journals that dispute points of papers that find a benefit from screening mammography. This doesn’t mean that Jørgensen and Gøtzsche are wrong, of course, only that they do appear to have a definite point of view, which should be kept in mind as much as anyone else’s point of view when examining a scientific paper. While I like their work to some extent as a counterweight to too much boosterism for ever earlier screening, I do find that they tend to go a bit too far at times in downplaying the usefulness of mammography, and at times they seem to be on a mission to cast doubt on mammography, as when they &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/588786"&gt;led a campaign to change a British leaflet&lt;/a&gt; used to encourage women to undergo mammography and making statements like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “it has not been proven that screening saves lives,” they insist, and new evidence shows less benefit and substantially more harm from screening than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this balance between risk and benefit has changed so much in recent years that nationwide programs of breast screening would be unacceptable, they say. “We believe that if policy makers had had the knowledge we now have when they decided to introduce screening about 20 years ago . . . we probably would not have had mammography screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that’s a huge overstatement. However, in fairness, I must mention that Michael Baum ChM, FRCS, MD, FRCR hon., a breast surgeon in England and someone I respect, also signed on to this campaign. I don’t entirely agree with everything he said, but I do take him, as well as Jørgensen and Gøtzsche, seriously. In any case, what bothers me about Jørgensen and Gøtzsche’s systematic review the most is the assumption behind it. Let’s look at how Jørgensen and Gøtzsche estimated overdiagnosis. Basically, the assumption is that in a population that begins screening, intitial cancer diagnoses should increase and there should be a compensatory decrease in cancer diagnoses in the population as women get older. The reason, if this model is valid, is that cancers that wouldn’t have been diagnosed until later ages are now being diagnosed when women are younger. So what Jørgensen and Gøtzsche did was to look for compensatory drops in breast cancer diagnoses in older women. One thing that also has to be emphasized is that this study looked only at mammographically detected breast cancers found by screening, not breast cancers detected by the palpation of a lump in the breast or other symptoms. If a woman has a lump in the breast, ruling out cancer is imperative, especially if the woman is over 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that needs to be understood is that the countries examined in this study (United Kingdom; Manitoba, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; Sweden; and parts of Norway) have very different screening protocols than we do in the United States. In most of these countries, for women at an average risk for breast cancer, screening with mammography doesn’t begin until age 50, and in some countries mammography is performed only once every two years, rather than every year. In addition, in many of these countries, screening ends after age 70 or so, which is one reason why Jørgensen and Gøtzsche break down the groups they look at into “too young for screening,” “screening age” (50-64 or 50-69, depending on the nation), or too old for screening. In the U.S., screening generally begins at age 40 and continues on a yearly basis in essence forever, a system that is, quite frankly, not well grounded in evidence and designed to maximize overdiagnosis, given that the evidence that screening between ages 40-50 reduces breast cancer mortality is rather weak, that the prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating mammography to date have excluded patients older than 74, and that few studies have rigorously looked at screening in women over 80. It’s also rather fascinating to those of us in the U.S. that mass screening programs in some of these countries didn’t start until the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, what Jørgensen and Gøtzsche found was that in these countries there was, as expected, an increase in the rate of diagnosis of both invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt; (DCIS), a lesion that is considered cancer but has not yet invaded out of the breast ducts. This is one problem that I have with this article, namely that it lumps together invasive cancers and DCIS. The reason is that DCIS is a condition of uncertain significance in that it is known that a significant percentage of DCIS never progresses to full cancer. Consequently, the inclusion of DCIS is guaranteed to inflate the estimate of overdiagnosis; from my perspective, DCIS should be analyzed separately. For one thing, it would give us a better idea of just how much overdiagnosis there might be in invasive breast cancer; more importantly it might provide evidence that “watchful waiting” might be safe in some cases of DCIS. Dumping the two together, however, confuses things. For example, what if 80% of the overdiagnosis is due to DCIS? Then overdiagnosis of invasive cancer would be much less, telling us that we should treat invasive cancers discovered by mammographic screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with the study was &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/jul09_1/b2587#217014"&gt;pointed out in the rapid responses &lt;/a&gt;on BMJ by Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, Professor of Radiology at the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital. I noticed this problem, too, but couldn’t formulate it as clearly at first. The problem is that this study is not looking at a fixed cohort of women before and after screening began. Consequently, every year, new women turn 50 and begin screening, and screened women “age out” of the screening system. Finally, another huge confounder that I don’t think that Jørgensen and Gøtzsche adequately account for is the use of hormone replacement therapy and the decrease in inherent breast cancer incidence that has begun since the report from the Women’s Health Initiative study that found increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots in women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) led to a dramatic decrease in the number of women using HRT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. There is no doubt that mammographic screening programs produce a rate of overdiagnosis. The question is: What is the rate? Unfortunately, the most accurate way to measure the true rate of overdiagnosis would be a prospective randomized trial, in which one group of women is screened and another is not, that follows both groups for many years, preferably their entire life. Such a study is highly unlikely ever to be done for obvious reasons, namely cost and the fact that there is sufficient evidence to show that mammographic screening reduces breast cancer-specific mortality for women between the ages of 50 and 70 at least, the latter of which would make such a study unethical. Consequently, we’re stuck with retrospective observational studies, such as the ones analyzed in this systematic review. One trial that has a stronger design, as far as I’m concerned, was reported in 2006 by Zackrisson et al entitled Rate of over-diagnosis of breast cancer 15 years after end of &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/332/7543/689"&gt;Malmö mammographic screening trial: follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;, which found a rate of overdiagnosis of between 10% and 18%, depending upon how the data were analyzed. For one thing, the Malmö study has the advantage of looking at individual women over time randomized to screening or no screening, rather than population-level numbers, as well as having a 15 year followup. Its disadvantage is that the Malmö mammographic screening trial was one of the classic ongoing studies, for which the screening occurred between the years 1976 to 1986. In the interim, mammography has become more sensitive, with improved imaging and digital mammography. Consequently, it is quite possible that the rate of overdiagnosis is higher than what was reported in the followup to the Malmö study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another wrinkle. As I discussed last December, there was recently a study that purported to show that roughly &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=300"&gt;22% of mammographically detected cancers might actually spontaniously regress&lt;/a&gt;. You may recall that I disputed whether the number was that high, but accepted that it’s probable that some percentage of mammographically-detected cancers might regress. (Remember, though, I’m referring to mammographically-detected cancers in asymptomatic women. There is no good evidence that cancers detected by palpation of a mass or other symptoms regress at an appreciable rate; they might do so rarely, but certainly not at anything approaching 20%.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an issue like this, I like to try to look for confluences of studies, and I think I’m starting to see one here. Overall, if you look at the literature, there appears to be a convergence of estimates of the rate of overdiagnosis for mammographically detected breast cancers of somewhere around 20-25%. Jørgensen and Gøtzsche’s work tends to represent the high end (and, indeed, seem custom-designed to me to make the estimate of overdiagnosis as high as possible), while the Malmö study representing the low end. Throw in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=300"&gt;Norwegian study&lt;/a&gt; that estimates that one in five mammographically detected breast cancers spontaneously regress, and science seems to be honing in on a “true” rate of overdiagnosis that is probably in the range of one in five to one in four. The problem then becomes: What do we do with that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned Michael Baum actually commented on the study under the title &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/jul09_1/b2587#216665"&gt;Attitudes to screening locked in time warp&lt;/a&gt;, where he advocates a complete rethink of the British breast cancer screening program. He’s right to some extent, but he goes too far in implying that the improvements in our understanding of the biology and natural history of breast cancer are such that we know enough to be highly confident in what to do about the program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, as described in Jørgensen and Gøtzsche’s paper, estimates of harm through over-diagnosis have increased. At the same time our understanding of the biology of breast cancer has improved so that the idea of latent or self limiting pathology that is so counter-intuitive to the screening community, is no longer surprising to those who have bothered to keep up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whilst the screening programme remains an inviolate bovine deity, treatment regimens have improved by leaps and bounds further narrowing the window of opportunity for screening to demonstrate an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, its a huge overstatement to say that treatment regimens have improved by “leaps and bounds” over the last 20 years. They have definitely improved, but not so dramatically that we can, as Baum appears to do, so blithely discount the potential benefits of detecting breast cancer earlier. Even if earlier detection, because of lead time bias, doesn’t change the overall prognosis, at the very least detecting cancer earlier makes it possible to use less disfiguring surgery in more women and to use less aggressive chemotherapy. This is not a benefit to be sneezed at, but it is one that is frequently completely ignored in discussions of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Baum is more on target is his suggestion for risk-adjusting our recommmendations for mammographic screening. I might quibble with his exact approach (and I do, actually), but it is becoming clear that mass screening programs of the “one-size-fits-all” variety for breast cancer are probably not doing as much good as advertised or are arguably doing more harm than previously expected. The time is coming for a less dogmatic approach than has been the norm. One approach might be an evidence- and science-based discussion of the known risks and benefits of mammographic screening. In an accompanying editorial, H. Gilbert Welch tried to &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul09_1/b1425?view=long&amp;amp;pmid=19589820"&gt;provide a “balance sheet” of the risks&lt;/a&gt; and benefits for 1000 women undergoing annual mammography for 10 years starting at the age of 50 years. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 woman will avoid dying from breast cancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2–10 women will be overdiagnosed and treated needlessly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10–15 women will be told they have breast cancer earlier than they would otherwise have been told, but this will not affect their prognosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100–500 women will have at least 1 “false alarm” (about half these women will undergo biopsy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the error bars around these estimates are very high. Where Welch is correct is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammography is one of medicine’s “close calls”—a delicate balance between benefits and harms—where different people in the same situation might reasonably make different choices. Mammography undoubtedly helps some women but hurts others. No right answer exists, instead it is a personal choice.&lt;br&gt;
To inform that choice, women need a simple tabular display of benefit and harms—a balance sheet of credits and debits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally important are the estimates themselves. Zackrisson and colleagues reported 62 fewer deaths from breast cancer and 115 women overdiagnosed—a ratio of one death avoided to two women overdiagnosed. Recently, Gøtzsche and colleagues argued in the BMJ that the ratio is one to 10. For many women, the tipping point may be within this range. Careful analyses that explicitly lay out their assumptions and methods, which will improve the precision of these estimates, are sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem in changing the way that screening programs for breast cancer are done is likely to be convincing women that a more selective approach to mammographic screening is desirable. To people not educated in cancer, it makes intuitive sense that detecting cancer earlier will result in better outcomes, and it is hard to explain the down side, namely over diagnosis, unnecessary biopsies and treatment, and the emotional distress that such false positive diagnoses make. Also, the maintenance of public and therefore political support often depends upon keeping the message as simple as possible. Including a discussion of the risks of mammography will likely be seen by many public health officials as “muddying the waters” and harming their efforts to promote screening. Moreover, great care has to be taken to make sure that the public understands that this discussion is only about the screening of asymptomatic women. Women with breast masses or other symptoms worrisome for cancer should not be led to refuse mammograms because of this discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, well-meaning legislators who don’t have a grasp of the potential for harm that screening has are uncritically promoting ever more mammographic screening, even for conditions for which it hasn’t been shown to result in a decrease in mortality. For example, in the U.S., we screen beginning at an earlier age than nearly every other industrialized nation, and we recommend mammography every year instead of every other year. For women over 50, screening has been shown to result in a 15-25% reduction in mortality due to breast cancer, but in women from 40 to 50 years of age demonstrating a major reduction in mortality due to screening is much more difficult and in women under 40 no such reduction has been noted, mainly because of two reasons. First, as the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/health/17screening.html"&gt;NYT article describes&lt;/a&gt;, younger women tend to have denser breast tissue, which makes mammography less sensitive. Second, although there is the perception that there is a lot of breast cancer in women under 40, in reality it is relatively uncommon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Love and other critics have also argued that a public health campaign could cause younger women to overestimate their chances of dying from breast cancer. Of the estimated 41,000 deaths a year in the United States from breast cancer, about 1 in 14 involve women younger than 45, according to the C.D.C. Only 1 in 33 breast cancer deaths — about 1,200 a year — occurs in women younger than 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what I said about screening for uncommon diseases? The less common the disease, the harder it is to screen for, and the more specific the test has to be to do have a chance of doing more harm than good. Targeting younger women for breast cancer screening not only shifts to a population that has a lower incidence of breast cancer but mammography is less sensitive in that population, two characteristics that combine to increase the potential for harm and decrease any potential for benefit. However, that’s exactly what Representative Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) is trying to do with her sponsorship of the &lt;a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1740"&gt;Breast Cancer Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act of 2009&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the EARLY Act. It’s a well-intentioned, but would almost certainly lead to these &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/health/17screening.html"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics say the House bill promotes techniques like breast self-exams that have not proved to find cancer at an earlier stage or to save lives. The concern is that the technique could cause younger women — a group for whom breast cancer is a rare disease — to find too many medically insignificant nodules that would lead doctors to perform unneeded biopsies, in which tissue is removed for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarring from biopsies could make breast cancer harder to detect when the women are older and have a much higher risk of getting the disease, critics say. And such false alarms can also cause women to distrust the medical system and skip mammograms later in life when the tests have been proved to reduce the death toll, said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, an oncologist who is the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that what seems intuitively obvious, namely that if some screening is good more screening must be better, is neither obvious nor science-based, and it’s really, really hard to explain that in a way that neither oversells the benefits or mammography nor leads women to think that mammography is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I hope for one day, and what may well come out of the emerging sciences of oncogenomics and proteonomics, is a manner of determining with more accuracy exactly which cancers will and will not progress. In that case, one potential harm of overtreatment of breast cancer, for example, would be obviated, namely treating women who don’t need them with aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Indeed, we already have some progress in this area with the &lt;a href="http://www.oncotypedx.com/"&gt;Oncotype DX&lt;/a&gt; gene assay and related products, which have already &lt;a href="http://www.oncotypedx.com/HealthcareProfessional/Guidelines.aspx?Sid=13"&gt;changed the way oncologists practice&lt;/a&gt; by giving them information about which estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients can safely forego adjuvant chemotherapy. The problem with such assays, of course, is that they still require tissue, which means that women with overdiagnosed breast cancers would still have to undergo a biopsy. Much better would be an imaging study that could provide the same risk information. Ten years ago, I would have thought such a system to be science fiction. Now I’m optimistic that by the end of my career we will be doing things that way, although what could scuttle any new technology is likely to be cost, which means that mammography is unlikely to be going anywhere any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we’ll have to muddle through with our imperfect screening systems, and try to tow a middle line between screening advocates who view screening as the be-all and end-all of breast cancer diagnosis and skeptics like Jørgensen and Gøtzsche, who seem to be arguing that screening programs for breast cancer are useless.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve written regularly that my son Charlie is “minimally verbal” and can’t talk too well. I realize this gives the impression that he is mostly silent and that our house is quiet. The reality cannot be farther from the truth and not just because Jim and I are something of “&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;big talkers&lt;/a&gt;.” Sound, including the sound of his voice, fills our house. Not always English, not always full sentences (rarely, actually); words and not always full words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of one of Dora’s posts, &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Just Because I’m Quiet Doesn’t Mean I Don’t Understand&lt;/a&gt; with a slight revision---”Just Because I’m Not Responding Doesn’t Mean I Don’t Understand”---comes often into my mind. Another variant would be “Just Because I Use a Word It Doesn’t Necessarily Mean What You’re Expecting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was younger and got very upset, Charlie often mentioned things he liked very much: burgers and fries, sushi, Gong Gong Po Po (my parents). This was very confusing and teachers, therapists, and Jim and I alike often responded by telling him that he could have X when he was calmer. But often he only got more upset even when he got the requested item. Teachers would ask if he were hungry and offer Charlie food that he inevitably did not want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be suggested that we were giving him some item---”reinforcing” him, to speak a bit behaviorally---before he was really calm and really giving him what he wanted for having a tantrum. But it was only gradually that Jim and I realized, Charlie saying the words for those preferred items was often a sign that he was, indeed, very upset. He wasn’t hungry and, when sometimes given some food item, he often only seemed even more upset afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I being the language-dependent individuals people that we are, it was at first quite a mystery to figure out what was going on. Gradually we could see patterns. We know that Charlie adores my parents, but why did he he cry when he first saw them at the airport? We slowly realized that this was a sign of a deeply emotional response on his part, with Charlie in part anticipating how he would feel after my parents left again and he missed them. This whole situation was a bit difficult on my parents, but they’re ultra-accommodating (actually, they’re generally just fabulous, not to get too gushy) and made it clear, they were ok with Charlie crying when they first showed up, as they knew he loved them. Often, within an hour of their arrival, Charlie would be all smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we try to teach Charlie as many words as we can. Speech therapists have gone back and forth about him having “problems with word retrieval.” I’ve come to suspect that he often does: He may well know all the words directed to him, and have many more in his head to say, but connecting what he wants to say with the motor activities involved in saying the word can be a lot to &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect that, at such times, Charlie does what I’ve done when speaking (trying to, that is) in a foreign language: He uses the word that’s the closest equivalent he can think of, or that he’s most used to saying, or that first comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the reasons that I’m not always sure what Charlie means when he says “no.” Sometimes he really means “no” as in “no.” But other times (based on what Charlie’s &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;done afterwards&lt;/a&gt;), “no” is more of a “no not yet” or “no I’m still thinking about it” or “maybe.” Or something else entirely. Often we try to suggest other things that Charlie could say, but when Charlie is stressed and not sure what to do or what he wants, having him talk more is placing yet one more demand on him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to take Charlie at his word and not assume that he has no idea what he’s saying. What I’ve tried to suggest here is that there’s a bit more of gray area to understanding Charlie’s speech. After all, many words for many of us mean much more than they might commonly denote, and certain words may have special associations that are part of highly personal, deeply meaningful memories that get lost in the translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now it’s official. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/that_inhuman_monolith.php"&gt;The Catholic Church has composed an official document declaring anyone involved in any abortion shall be excommunicated&lt;/a&gt;. NO EXCEPTIONS! Well, except for the rapist. In cases where a fetus is the product of a rape, it’s not like the rapist had anything to do with the abortion, so they can still get into heaven if they play their cards right. After all, the Bible is perfectly clear on this point. Rape victims must marry their rapists and raise their child together (Deut. 22:28). Besides, if rapists were excommunicated, who’d run the churches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…there is a more important principle at stake. “We have laws, we have a discipline, we have a doctrine of the faith,” the official says. “This is not just theory. &lt;strong&gt;And you can’t start backpedaling just because the real-life situation carries a certain human weight.&lt;/strong&gt;” Benedict makes it ever more clear that his strict approach to doctrine will remain a central pillar to his papacy, bad publicity be damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, since when did the Catholic Church care about real-life? That’s right, never! Screw you real-life situations! We don’t need you as long as we have our Bible, our self-righteousness, our millennia-old morality, and our dogma! &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/lets-not-look-backwards-no-lets/"&gt;And three cheers for child rape!!! Woo!!&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

The left in disgust over gender inequality issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women and girls have been discriminated against for too long in a twisted interpretation of the word of God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was, however, an unavoidable decision when the convention’s leaders, quoting a few carefully selected Bible verses and claiming that Eve was created second to Adam and was responsible for original sin, ordained that women must be “subservient” to their husbands and prohibited from serving as deacons, pastors or chaplains in the military service.This view that women are somehow inferior to men is not restricted to one religion or belief. Women are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many faiths. Nor, tragically, does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple. This discrimination, unjustifiably attributed to a Higher Authority, has provided a reason or excuse for the deprivation of women’s equal rights across the world for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it just gets better and better from there. I recommend reading Carter’s entire article. It’s funny how Richard Dawkins says this and he’s called a bigot who doesn’t understand religion, and yet Jimmy Carter has been heavily involved in church for 60 years. Does he too not understand religion?&lt;/p&gt;

This lack of scrutiny allowed this dangerous substance that has caused 900 people to lose their sense of smell to reach market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I found &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;amp;sid=aUjZT68DlqiI"&gt;this Bloomberg article&lt;/a&gt; reporting that the FDA admits the homeopathy label let this product slip by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zicam’s homeopathic label allowed it to be marketed for a decade without a review for safety or effectiveness by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article then goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeopathic products -- over-the-counter remedies that use plant, mineral or animal derivatives -- don’t need marketing clearance from the FDA under U.S. rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;And therein, lies the problem. Bloomberg has it completely WRONG.</summary><author><name>jeff@randi.org (Jeff Wagg)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248067976083"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/go_help_ethan_raise_money_hes.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/366e7fcccf76fa04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Go Help Ethan Raise Money.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If an American network stole this TV idea, what should this show be called in America?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We're targeting groups that graduate students are focusing on, including molluscs (Paola), crustaceans (Nick), and wasps (Joao), as well as some for undergraduate studies including flies (Paula) and "EPTs" -- Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stone flies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies) (Kelly).  We are also collecting annelids, various insects, and spiders.  For the first time, we are working on plants as well.  In addition to Paola, Nick, and Joao, we have Brandon joining us for this trip.

&lt;p&gt;He taught at Stuyvesant High School in New York.  I know Harvard’s Humanist Chaplain &lt;strong&gt;Greg Epstein&lt;/strong&gt; went to school there, but I don’t know if he ever had McCourt as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person who did have McCourt as a teacher was &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Radosh&lt;/strong&gt;, the author of the hilarious book about Christian pop culture, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743297709?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0743297709"&gt;Rapture Ready!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="http://www.radosh.net/archive/002717.html"&gt;reminisces about his teacher&lt;/a&gt; and offers a brief god-free eulogy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Over the years I’d run into McCourt periodically and he was always warm and friendly. I last saw him a few months ago at an event he did in Woodstock and when I gave him a copy of Rapture Ready! he held it up for the crowd and beamed, “Former student!” It was perhaps the most rewarding response I’ve had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the practical lessons I learned in Frank McCourt’s class, I’ll always remember him as a model for how to be cynical without being jaded and sarcastic without being inhumane. I’m pretty sure he did not believe in God or an afterlife, but he had to believe that there is an immortality in living so that your words and actions transform the world around you in ways that will continue to reverberate forever. No one with so much life in him can ever truly die. And if there were an afterlife, I can guarantee you that somewhere right now, Frank McCourt would be mightily pissed off that he’s not around for what’s sure to be a hell of a wake.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/end_the_bureaucratic_pain"&gt;gloom&lt;/a&gt;-and-doom-y sort of posts, I wanted to note two more positive developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.specialisterne.dk/"&gt;Specialisterne&lt;/a&gt; is a Danish company founded in 2005 by Thorkil Sonne, whose son has autism; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/putting_autism_to_work"&gt;three out of four of its employees have Asperger's Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is for all employees to be ISEB test certified; employees have tested software for the likes of Microsoft and Oracle. The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8155125.stm"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that the company is hoping to set up a similar program in the UK---am hopeful for that, and then maybe they might migrate across the pond......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, closer to home (for me here in the Garden State in the US), the &lt;a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/pan"&gt;Penn Autism Network&lt;/a&gt; is holding a four-day workshop on college coaching to assist students transitioning to post-secondary education. Registration is closed but the description for the workshops highlights some important topics, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• How to support students with social skills difficulties in college &lt;br&gt;
• Ways to recognize mental health problems that need referral &lt;br&gt;
• Strategies for supporting personal independence &lt;br&gt;
• Understanding issues of time management, sensory overwhelm, day to day self-management &lt;br&gt;
• Methods of supporting friendships, social relationships, and faculty and staff interactions &lt;br&gt;
• Approaches to collaborating with on-campus student resources &lt;br&gt;

Everything that needed to be said about TAM 7 probably have been said and so I won’t be repetitive here.  Of all the activities I was involved with (sorry I missed the Skepchicks party but I do need my beauty sleep!) the Connie Sonne dowsing challenge was the most impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the organizers, I had a front row VIP seat to watch this experiment. (I guess there are some advantages to being a D-list celebrity!!)  I was very impressed with how meticulous the experiment was conducted and even more impressed with how all the audience (estimated at about 500) was able to keep absolutely quiet and still – not a cough, not a chair squeak – throughout the duration of the challenge.  I can’t imagine a room full of skeptics – outspoken skeptics – watching this demonstration of psychic power not wanting to scream out some invective or irreverence comment.  But we were all very well behaved and the demonstration of psychic Sonne’s ability to dowse failed – failed spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The honest truth is that while I sat watching her dowse, I somehow wanted her to succeed.  Yes, my rational-self knew she would fail. I understand the laws of physics and that the fundamental forces of nature as well as statistics are not in her favor.  But yet, deep down, and for very selfish reasons I wanted her to succeed.  If she could indeed dowse for the cards under such strict conditions, she would be on her way to proof there there possibly could be another force of nature hereto undiscovered – and I was in a front-row seat to witness it – how cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trained as a scientist and worked in applied science and engineering all my working life but I grew up in a culture where existence of unmeasurable, undetectable imaginary force fields are taken for granted.  Perhaps if Connie succeeded and dowsing is indeed a reality, we can set out to find the reality behind the phenomenon. If we can find the “dowsing force” can we not find the “chi force” and rehabilitate my fore-bearers pseudoscience and bad medicine?  Wishful thinking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one observation I would like to share with you – and that is the noticeable absence of attendees and panel participants of Asian descent.  This is not the only skeptics movement events where I have noticed this dearth of Asian (especially Chinese and Koreans) participation. Go to any science, technology events or to any science and engineering departments in any major universities in North America and you will see people of Chinese, Korean and Japanese ancestry very well represented. Yet, they are all but absent from the skeptics movement.  I met a couple of “pale white guys” (their words!) from the skeptic society in Vancouver, BC, Canada and they brought up the same observation.  Vancouver, BC has the largest Chinese population or any cities outside China, after Singapore, yet they are conspicuously absent from their local skeptic movement. I find it impossible to belief that all the professors in physics, chemistry,  or astronomy of Chinese ancestry in our great universities and research centers believe in chi, animal astrology, feng shui and other woo-woo nonsense.  I cannot believe that all the pharmacology professors in our most esteem pharmacy and medical schools would accept all the Chinese herb remedies that have been tested and found to be a placebo at best and harmful at worst. So where are they in the skeptic movement – are they not interested in getting the message out?  Are they not willing to “rock the boat” when it comes to skewering the holy cows of their own culture?  Is there too much respect for their ancestors and filial piety prevents them from criticizing their ancestors cherished believes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, but I’ll be looking in it and see if I can do some outreach!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yau-Man Chan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248045120187"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8207156221725644446">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2303d50af246c600</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gene Expression" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Genome" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Genes" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Origin of Dachshunds</title><published>2009-07-19T21:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T23:14:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/origin-of-dachshunds.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8207156221725644446/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8207156221725644446" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> A draft sequence of the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) genome has been available for several years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have a challenge for everyone who reads this.

&lt;p&gt;Donate at least ten dollars (or ten euros, or ten pounds, or whatever's the closest equivalent in your currency) or volunteer at least four hours at whatever charitable organization you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do it, leave a comment at the bottom of this post, telling us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what you donated/volunteered to do,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what organization you donated to/volunteered for, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why you chose that organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get 100 unique comments from people who have done this, &lt;strong&gt;I will shave my head&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take a gander at the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_charity_ch.php"&gt;pictures Ethan has posted&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see that a fully-shorn head will be a big change for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's help his scalp see daylight.  I've just given some money through &lt;a href="http://donorschoose.org/"&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt; to help a classroom in a high poverty school in Northern California to buy some microscopes.  But the comment count on Ethan's post hasn't hit 20 yet -- far short of what he's asking before the head gets shaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget, you don't have to donate money -- if you donate four hours of your time to a charitable organization, that will count, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/help_a_charity_get_a_sciencebl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/K2of8WBSyYU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248044741480"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1588">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7c19f6fcb64647a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the law"/><title type="html">Verbing up in the trademark business</title><published>2009-07-19T23:04:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T23:04:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1588" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's common practice in the trademark world to never, never, never use your trademarked name as a verb or a noun. If you do this, you'll be committing genericide, because your brand name will surely lose its distinctiveness and pretty soon you'll be losing your market edge. Why else would Xerox try so hard to teach us to say " to photocopy" rather than "to xerox"? Always use your name as an adjective, "Xerox photocopiers." But the New York Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/weekinreview/19cohen.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft's Steve Ballmer doesn't much believe in common practice, and he's now busily ignoring what everyone else is doing. He wants us to say, "he will bing you tomorrow," which more problematically might lead to, "he banged you yesterday."    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Ballmer recognizes that things change so rapidly in this wonderful electronic age that there's no real benefit to be derived from long-term brand names. But while Google is still holding firm against "googling" and "googled," I wonder if Ballmer is on to something here. He seems to delight in the possibility that  Bing has the potential "to verb up."&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248044043459"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5200291921260357719">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28e8a1e73f94f077</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Is the Christian God loving and compassionate?</title><published>2009-07-19T20:57:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T20:59:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/P4Yieyf1QbY/is-christian-god-loving-and.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5200291921260357719/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5200291921260357719" title="34 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/is-christian-god-loving-and.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">First an apology.

Smaller black spots have been found, and the shape of the big spot indicates a trajectory for the incoming bolide. I’m still waiting for images and more info, but for now this is looking much more like an impact and not a simple weather event as I speculated.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.acquerra.com.au/astro/ObsReport/jupiter-impact.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/jupiter_black_spot.jpg" alt="Jupiter’s new black spot"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The black spot is at the top of this image.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just saw on Twitter (hard to believe I ever thought Twitter was useless) that &lt;a href="http://www.acquerra.com.au/astro/ObsReport/jupiter-impact.html"&gt;Jupiter is sporting a new black spot near its south pole&lt;/a&gt;. You can see it in the picture here (click to go to the source and embiggen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on Twitter (and on that site linked above) are speculating that this is the result of a large impact on Jupiter, similar to what happened in 1994 when comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 slammed into the big planet. But I think that’s premature; weather changes rapidly on Jupiter, and black spots have appeared before — see &lt;a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA01496"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/jupiter_spot_020313.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. That doesn’t mean this isn’t an impact event (or, for that matter, the earlier events weren’t either) but it’s jumping the gun to call it an impact event before we get more observations. I will add that this new spot is indeed very dark, which means it’s pretty interesting no matter what it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An irony: I am at LaunchPad, a workshop about astronomy for science fiction authors, and tonight we’re planning on visiting the Wyoming Infrared Observatory, where they have a 2.3 meter IR ’scope, which is perfect to observe something like this. Even better, the spot should be visible tonight while we’re there! The irony is, dagnappit, that it’s very cloudy here for the first time in days. I’m hoping this cloud layer will blow out so we can get a chance to see this rare and interesting phenomenon on Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and more irony? In a few minutes, as I write this, I will be giving my &amp;quot;Death from the Skies&amp;quot; talk, which focuses specifically on asteroid and comet impacts.

Australia’s just now catching up to the rest of the world &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former President &lt;strong&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/strong&gt; may still be religious (despite the misleading headline in the linked piece), but &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/losing-my-religion-for-equality-20090714-dk0v.html?page=-1"&gt;he has left the Southern Baptist Convention&lt;/a&gt; after 60 years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His reason: the treatment of women in his denomination and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It was, however, an unavoidable decision when the convention’s leaders, quoting a few carefully selected Bible verses and claiming that Eve was created second to Adam and was responsible for original sin, ordained that women must be “subservient” to their husbands and prohibited from serving as deacons, pastors or chaplains in the military service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This view that women are somehow inferior to men is not restricted to one religion or belief. Women are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many faiths. Nor, tragically, does its influence stop at the walls of the church, mosque, synagogue or temple. This discrimination, unjustifiably attributed to a Higher Authority, has provided a reason or excuse for the deprivation of women’s equal rights across the world for centuries.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply self-defeating for any community to discriminate against half its population. We need to challenge these self-serving and outdated attitudes and practices — as we are seeing in Iran where women are at the forefront of the battle for democracy and freedom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to believe Carter just came to discover that religion has a habit of oppressing women.  Those of us who aren’t religious have known that for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was Carter on this subject for the past couple decades, when he had even more influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great piece, and it’s worth the read, but it may be too little too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, God was missing when Sanford was secretly emailing the mistress, catching a flight to see her, and getting it on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s in the spirit of making good from bad that I am committing to you and the larger family of South Carolinians to use this experience to both trust God in his larger work of changing me, and from my end, to work to becoming a better and more effective leader…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard I think all that has transpired will be particularly relevant in the way I deal with the legislative body and other state leaders going forward. &lt;strong&gt;Micah 6:8 asks us to do justice, love mercy, and to walk humbly&lt;/strong&gt;, and as I begin these steps into the last 18 months of this administration, it will indeed be with a more contrite and humble spirit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Sanford didn’t read enough of his Bible because &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah%206:13;&amp;amp;version=31;"&gt;Micah 6:13&lt;/a&gt;, a few verses later, has God saying something very different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Therefore, I have begun to destroy you, to ruin you because of your sins.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, God has &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-borowitz/god-orders-sanford-to-sto_b_240046.html"&gt;already responded&lt;/a&gt; to Sanford’s piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“At no point did I say that I was trying to make Mark Sanford a better person,” the Almighty told reporters. “And the only time that bastard has prayed to Me was last month, when his exact words were, ‘Please don’t let Jenny find out where I really am.’”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a taste of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Paranormal Woo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Astrology – 65 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Tarot Cards – 61 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Psychic – 60 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Fortune Telling – 41 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Voodoo – 41 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Numerology – 32 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Palm Reading – 28 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Ouija – 15 Apps&lt;br&gt;
Dowsing -1 App&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concern is that these apps are being made because people are downloading them and some are taking them seriously.  And I can’t imagine all these are free… so people are paying for iPhone “Tarot cards,” as if they weren’t fake enough to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(An iPhone dowsing app?  Really?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what would sell to atheists?  An app in which you type in the name of an alcoholic beverage… Then, &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/strong&gt;‘ face appears, with a moving mouth, and tells you the ingredients in that drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want royalties when that gets made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checkout fellow scans my Gardenburgers, wheat buns, cheese and mustard and opines; “Burgers for dinner?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah, no shit, mate’, I think… “Yes!” I smile broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another day, the checkout chick eyes my grapes, bananas, apples and blueberries and says, “Are you making a fruit salad, Ms Stollznow?” (Yeah, they even store my details on their ‘benefit’ cards.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Mind your own bloody business’, I think… “Yes!” I smile broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, their work is mundane, they’re being friendly, and since they’re handling my groceries I can’t expect them to close their eyes to what my purchases reveal about me…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, oh my, what are these people &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; when I buy &lt;em&gt;pimple cream&lt;/em&gt;? Or &lt;em&gt;prunes&lt;/em&gt;? Or &lt;em&gt;eye-drops for red eyes&lt;/em&gt;?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although, I’d love it if one of them had the nerve to look me in the eyes when I buy condoms and say, “Have a nice fuck tonight, Ms Stollznow!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some personal, embarrassing or rude comments you’ve heard from supermarket staff about your purchases?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin:0px;padding:0px;display:inline;float:none"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/IVbnciQYMiM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=355" width="425" height="355"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future, when some theist says something like, &lt;em&gt;“what is the origin of life and/or the origin of the information&amp;quot; necessary to bring life into existence?”&lt;/em&gt; you can answer with: “The thing that made the things for which there is no known maker and that causes and directs the events that we can&amp;#39;t otherwise explain and which doesn&amp;#39;t need to have been made and is the one thing from which to ask for things that no human can give and without him we can&amp;#39;t be fully happy and is unlimited by all the laws of physics and never began and will never finish and is invisible but is actually everywhere at once and who is so perfect that even if he killed millions of people, including babies, he still would be perfect and who is so powerful and magical that he can even make a virgin pregnant if he wanted to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is, of course, just as meaningful and useful an answer as “god.”&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, researchers recognise that the brain is made up of dynamic, flexible networks, in which diverse regions are recruited according to task demands. Complementing this account is a growing recognition of the brain's ability to adapt to damage, even in adulthood - a characteristic known as plasticity. These views are captured in a new clinical case study that documents the recovery of language performance in a man known as "FV". He'd had a tumour removed from a relatively large section of his brain, including "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca&amp;#39;s_area"&gt;Broca's area&lt;/a&gt;", considered since the nineteenth century to be a vital neural centre for speech production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Broca's area is named after the nineteenth century French surgeon Paul Broca for his work with a patient who, following localised damage to the rear part of his left frontal lobe, lost the ability to produce speech, with the exception of the syllable 'tan', hence his nickname 'Tan tan'. The man's comprehension, meanwhile, remained intact, leading to the popular conclusion that Broca's area is important for speech production, but not comprehension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/spip.php?article2104"&gt;Monique Plaza&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues thoroughly tested FV's language skills before, during and after his tumour was surgically removed. Importantly, additional to standard neuropsychological tests, the researchers used a narrative task that required FV to tell the story played out in a children's picture book - a test the researchers said was sensitive to deficits not detected by standard measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers found that FV's tumour and its subsequent removal did not lead to the severe language deficits that would be expected based on a traditional localisation approach to brain function. Because his tumour had grown slowly, the researchers said other areas of FV's brain, adjacent to Broca's area, had been able to take over language functions, including the premotor cortex and the head of the caudate nucleus. FV showed some expected deficits after surgery, but quickly regained most of his speech production abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the narrative task did identify some intriguing subtle deficits that FV's brain obviously hadn't been able to shop out to adjacent brain areas.

&lt;p&gt;If Bob Dylan provides the soundtrack for much of my life, then coffee provides the "smelltrack".  I did not start to drink coffee until I was about 20.  My best friend of 18 years told me I should learn to, as I might need it.  He also told me to drink it black, because I might not always have cream and sugar, but I still might need the coffee.  So, I started to drink it.  Now, this was terrible coffee...institutional, stale, sour, just generally bad.  And the coffee revolution of the 90s had not yet hit.  I had nowhere to go  but up.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of the study is now complete and the results are published in the journal Marine and Coastal Fisheries: Dynamics, Management, and Ecosystem Science  2009; 1: 143-154: &lt;a href="http://afsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1577/C08-042.1" title=""&gt;Description and Initial Evaluation of a Text Message Based Reporting Method for Marine Recreational Anglers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://afsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1577/C08-042.1" title=""&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) by M. Scott Baker Jr. and Ian Oeschger. It is relatively short and easy to read, so I recommend you take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase will continue with the program, with refinements, and will also include records of fish catch from fishing tournaments. Also, I hope to see this study presented at ScienceOnline'10 next January as an example of the forward-looking use of modern online technologies for collection of scientific data by citizen scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/a_few_months_ago_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/qiPSpMTWWE0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248027916928"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=579">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c55847ac8244abc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="psychology"/><title type="html">Marketing Psychology</title><published>2009-07-21T12:16:15Z</published><updated>2009-07-21T12:16:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=579" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Skepticism is, among other things, a useful shield against manipulative sales techniques. Consumer protection is certainly part of our mission statement, and not just by exposing pseudoscientific products but also mechanisms of deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember taking a social psychology course in college that covered the psychology of salesmanship, and soon after getting a first hand experience. The family of a friend, knowing I was interested in science and education, asked for my help in evaluating a product. The traveling salesman was in their living room and they wanted me to pop over and help them assess what he was selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-something man was indeed sitting in their living, one leg in a removable cast. Apparently he had just suffered some injury, and had to hobble around on crutches to make his living. He was selling an all-in-one textbook designed to help students through highschool. He sat on one side of the room with the family across from him. As he showed the features of the large tome he would also follow up with a question, such as, “Do you think that would be helpful?” He also made a point of telling us all the people in the neighborhood who had purchased the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with my recent study of such techniques I pulled aside my friend and their father and told them what was going on. This guy is using every cheap trick in the book – gathering sympathy, using peer pressure, and trying to get them to agree that the product is useful so they would seem inconsistent if they then declined to purchase it. I speculated that the cast was for show only. Further, the product itself was all but useless. Costing over a hundred dollars, it would likely sit on their shelf collecting dust, never to be cracked open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I explained all of this to the family they still decided to buy the worthless book. The psychological manipulation was just too great – they could not send the salesman away without a purchase after he spent so much time in their living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then the science of manipulation has only become more sophisticated. Companies are now armed with statistics and psychological experiments to optimize their sales. Most people are surprised to learn how easy we are to manipulate and feel that other people can be manipulated, but not them. We all think we are the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the manipulation derives from the fact that we are intensely social animals. We need to fit in, and to feel a connection to others and the community. That is why we are susceptible to peer pressure, and fear seeming inconsistent to others. &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news167326386.html"&gt;Recent studies &lt;/a&gt;also show that the feeling of connection can be exploited to make sales. In one study subjects who were told they shared a birthday with the salesperson were more likely to by a product and be happy with their purchase. In another study subjects who were told they shared a birthplace with their dentist rated the experience more favorably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that just the coincidence of a common connection makes us feel good, and we are more likely to buy. Keep that in mind the next time a sales person chats you up and just happens to share something in common with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090720190739.htm"&gt;Other recent research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that we judge unfamiliar products by the company they keep – what other products they are surrounded by. This is partly why company reps obsess about where their products are placed on shelves. They want visibility, but now also they will want a familiar context – place their cheap and new product among more expensive brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples, and unless one is an expert or makes and extended study of this subject you can’t know all the ways in which we can be manipulated. But it is helpful just to know that we can be manipulated and that anyone trying to sell us something is probably trying to do so in one or more ways. But you can protect yourself just by engaging your skepticism whenever confronted with a sales pitch. Be wary of your emotions, social fears, and assumptions. Try to rely on objective information about the product – evaluate it as if it were an extraordinary claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it does also help to learn the most common tricks of the trade. A savvy consumer is skeptical and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;

She gets up, makes a cup of coffee with two Equals and a splash of french vanilla creamer, and reads one of her favorite blogs, &lt;a href="http://behindthestick.wordpress.com"&gt;Behind the Stick&lt;/a&gt;.   Seriously, if you're not reading &lt;a href="http://behindthestick.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;Scribbler's&lt;/a&gt; blog, you are missing out on some of the funniest non-science stuff out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my beloved bartender &lt;a href="http://behindthestick.wordpress.com/2009/07/18/by-any-other-name/"&gt;has a post&lt;/a&gt; about remembering the names of his customers.  He writes....&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
... Nailing the drinks of my occasionals... those people who come in every two or three months... is almost as common to me as that home run is rare. And I'll bet almost every other bartender can make the same claim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Names? That's a different story. If I don't write the names at the top of the tabs of the people who don't come in often, Ben will invariably become Barney, Joan will be addressed as Janet, and Luke will morph into Lenny or freaking Aloysius! Which brings me (maybe) to a theory on how this all works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, a drink somehow carries a built-in identity, it pigeonholes the person who is ordering, and when the person orders that drink an association is made....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, le sigh, sweet readers. You see, this is not unique to bartending.  It happens to Dr. Isis all the damned time.  I am horrible, &lt;i&gt;horrible&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;horrible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; at remembering people's names.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, if I had a dollar for everytime someone said to me, "Hey, Isis!  Have you read the latest paper that Bob Smith wrote?"  Then there is an awkward silence as I try to remember who the balls "Bob Smith" is and they begin to fill in the gap, "You know.  He just published that paper using compound X."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I am able to finish, "...to treat blood vessels and turn them in to unicorns!  Yes!  I totally read that!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7-wvHLPtnSQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not that I don't stay up on the literature.  I really, really do.  I usually tackle the week's journals after I read Scribbler.  It's just that unless I've met someone and talked to them face to face about their work or, more certainly, sat and had a drink with them, I don't always remember someone's work by their name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what I need to start doing is bring my fellow scientists to Scribbler's joint for a couple of vodka martinis.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of families take turns hosting the once-a-week meetings in their home, the father of the host home directing the activities with the large families in attendance: Bible study, Bible memorization, singing, and prayer, all of which is followed by a hearty meal. I normally join the group for the meal on days when my wife and children attend. I get along fairly well with the leaders of this home church, even though their worldview is diametrically opposed to mine. We have had some spirited discussions over the years, but we’re all normally quite friendly and congenial to each other.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a first-hand participant in the story I’m about to tell; I have heard only one perspective, so I cannot claim complete objectivity, but I present the story as accurately as I’m able.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A member of this home church, a single mother (I’ll call her Jane) who was abandoned by her husband about eight years ago, recently started dating another man (I’ll call him John) whose wife had left him and their three children a few years ago. Both John and Jane are fundamentalist believers. I met John at a recent home church dinner, and he seems very personable and successful in his career. In observing them together, I am happy for them: they’re obviously in love, talking about marriage. She has worked so hard as a single mother, baby-sitting and cleaning houses, to provide for her children for so many years, but if they marry, she will no longer bear this intense burden. In turn, John will have someone to help care for his children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter the home church leadership. Their understanding of Jesus’ teachings does not permit them to bless this relationship or the marriage into which John and Jane seem to be headed. They feel that John should make a greater effort to be reconciled with his former wife, even though she was the one who initiated the divorce. Otherwise, if he remarries, he will be living in sin. Not only is the home church leadership not prepared to bless the relationship; they have gone so far as to confront Jane, a longstanding member of the home church, and when she declined to call off the relationship, the leadership excommunicated her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course Jane is devastated by all this: in the midst of one of the most joyous periods of her life, she is sternly confronted and excommunicated by some of her closest friends. John will not speak to the home church leaders, knowing how they have treated Jane. It appears the relationship will go forward, but their joy has been doused by the moral zeal of Jane’s home church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now my wife is wondering how to relate to the home church. She feels for Jane and doesn’t understand the actions taken against her, but she wishes if possible to retain her ties with the home church. In discussing the situation with my wife, I expressed my dismay at what the leadership had done, but I did not advise her one way or the other—I felt it was up to her to decide whether to continue her occasional attendance at the home church. So far no decision has been made, and since her attendance was only occasional, perhaps no stir will be caused if she quietly stops attending the church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps I have taken the easy way out by washing my hands of the situation. I’m glad Jane will no longer be part of the home church and that she will be free to marry John. I just wish it hadn’t happened, and part of me wants to confront the home church leadership to show how ugly their faith has become. Then again, none of my prior conversations with them about the age of the earth or the reliability of the Bible had any apparent effect, so I’m doubtful they would be any more swayed by a moral confrontation from an infidel like me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is truly a lamentable situation. It shows how human compassion can be made to take a back seat to the “righteousness” of one’s firm religious views.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4077927022329300078?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Fresh new ideas, unusual ways of looking at things, and above all questioning questioning questioning what are the filters that individuals and groups look through when they look at autism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One main theme, the first introduced, is the insidiousness of culturally sanctioned stigma, and its effect on academic orientation and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking back on history, maybe you've wondered how it was that American colleges and universities could ever have contributed to racist discourse. But Princeton and many other institutions kept out Jews, and "academic" defenses of slavery, segregation, and eugenics were commonplace until broader social changes rendered such views unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is that dehumanizing ideologies are still with us in the modern university, although they take very different forms. Prime examples include the unacceptable ways we sometimes talk and think about the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of culturally sanctioned stigma is exactly what is going on in the current drama of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=psycho+donuts"&gt;Psycho Donuts&lt;/a&gt;.  This is exactly what is going on in the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_finer_points_of_employment_discrimination"&gt;finer points of employment discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sampling of the "unacceptable ways," Cowen cites the Harvard study I cited way back in discussion of the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rethinking_cost_to_society"&gt;barbarism of pricing people's lives&lt;/a&gt;.  And also a book called (yes, ironically) &lt;em&gt;The Ethics of Autism&lt;/em&gt;--I had read a review of this book a ways back and found aspects the book's content so appalling I was too disgusted to even write an outraged entry here.  Appalling content that, as Cowen notes, "could be refuted by a few simple conversations with autistic people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, universities and academics tend to be the sources of paradigm shifts and cultural change.  That Cowen is an academic who is thinking critically about the issue and engaging others to do the same is excellent.  Critical thinking is always the first step toward change.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248023342165"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13955">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/511e1294b1b97e6b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Demographics"/><category term="FFRF"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">The New Atheism Is Not Gone Yet</title><published>2009-07-19T17:04:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T17:04:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/19/the-new-atheism-is-not-gone-yet/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Professor &lt;strong&gt;Byron R. McCane&lt;/strong&gt; is chair of the Religion Department at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.  I don’t know what it takes to earn that title, but it can’t be much.  In an opinion piece for &lt;em&gt;The State&lt;/em&gt; newspaper, &lt;a href="http://www.thestate.com/editorial-columns/story/869656.html"&gt;he shows his complete ignorance about atheism&lt;/a&gt; in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
New atheism looked like the wave of the future. But not anymore. “Religulous” got mixed reviews and disappeared quickly. Rebuttals to Dawkins, Dennett and Hitchens have appeared, culminating with Karen Armstrong’s new book, The Case for God. Sales of atheist books have fallen off the charts, literally. Months have gone by since one appeared on the best-seller list.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  The books by those atheist authors were on the bestsellers list for months at a time, each of them (some even longer), but now that it’s been a few years and they’re no longer on it, that’s a sign of the decline of atheism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at all.  Every book has a shelf life.  At some point, the people who are going to read it have read it, and new sales go down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lull right now, but more books about atheism are on their way, by a multitude of newer atheist authors, exploring new niches in the atheism genre: parenting, dating, celebrating holidays, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re only at the beginning stages of a surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why did the new atheists falter so quickly? Because they ignored important facts about religion in America today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they dramatically overestimated the number of unbelievers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCane cites stats we’ve seen before, that say the percentage of atheists is low.  That’s not surprising.  Part of the reason for the low numbers includes the fact that “atheist” still has negative connotations.  Some people who are atheists are afraid to say so — or simply don’t know that they are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ignores the 2007 &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/01/10/a-portrait-of-generation-next/"&gt;study of Generation Next&lt;/a&gt; which stated that &lt;em&gt;20% of adults under the age of 25&lt;/em&gt; have “no religious affiliation.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The membership of atheist organizations like the &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org"&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is higher now than ever before and they’re showing no signs of dropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of atheist Meetup groups is proliferating and the &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has more groups now than at any time in our nearly 10-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Second, the new atheists thought that books about science and logic would convince Americans to stop believing in God.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think any of the atheist authors believed that America was about to stop being religious because of their books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seeds have been planted.  People are talking about religion moreso now than ever before.  Atheists who were previously closeted are coming out and saying so.  The more that happens, the easier it’ll be for everyone else.  We’re less afraid of questioning religious dogma than we were before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it some time.  The tide will turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yet the new atheists’ biggest mistake, by far, was to be openly intolerant of religion. They mocked, derided and made fun of it. But Americans today are overwhelmingly committed to religious tolerance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, McCane &lt;em&gt;doesn’t give a single example&lt;/em&gt; of this “intolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s absolutely nothing wrong with pointing out how ridiculous religious beliefs are — some more than others.  We should continue to do that, while sympathizing with those who sincerely believe them.  We need to start discussions about religion that many people are afraid to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious tolerance means people have a right to believe what they want.  No atheist is trying to take that away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re perfectly welcome to point out that those beliefs make no sense, though.  And we will continue to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our best bet is to get people questioning &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they believe what they do.  I’m not convinced that all religious believers have ever truly thought about the reasons they hold their beliefs.  And for many people, I don’t think “the Bible says so” will cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some atheists do this with sarcasm; others make a sincere effort to talk to religious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “intolerance”?  Did we beat up religious believers?  Did we ever try to take away their right to pray?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The new atheism is over and done, and its angry tone of voice will not be missed. But a kinder, gentler and (most of all) wiser atheism should be able to find its niche as one option among many in the spiritual marketplace.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the hell that means.  What is “kinder, gentler, wiser” atheism?  The author says “there is plenty of room for atheist groups that can attract seekers by presenting unbelief as a practical option along life’s way.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly what atheist groups do.  The billboards, the bus ads, the books — probably all examples of “intolerant atheism” to this guy — they all point out that living without God is a practical option and there’s nothing wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of making that convincing, though, is telling people why their current religious beliefs are not worth keeping.  It requires pointing out why they don’t make sense and why people need to “break the spell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t do the former without the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if anyone wants to explain what McCane suggestion of tolerant atheism being a “thoughtful expression of principled religious dissent” means, I’d love to hear it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand how comforting it would be to *think* someone was listening to (and maybe answering) your prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could any &lt;em&gt;atheist&lt;/em&gt; think it’s “nice” to pray… when you know no one is listening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just seems futile at best, silly at worst.&lt;br&gt;

A randomized trial comparing acupuncture, simulated acupuncture, and usual care for chronic low back pain. Archives of Internal Medicine 2009 169: 858-866&lt;/blockquote&gt; but evidence-based healthcare knowledge collater, Bandolier has written a plain, easy-to-digest synopsis of the paper &lt;a href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/painpag/Chronrev/Other/acuback.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study looked at four therapies; individualised acupuncture, standardised acupuncture, simulated acupuncture with toothpicks and lastly, usual care. From Bandolier:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This large trial involved 638 adults, with follow up of 90% or above up to 52 weeks. Participants had an average age of about 47 years, with about 60% being women. About 70% had back pain for at least a year. The average initial RMDQ score was about 10.5 on a 0-24 scale, and average initial bothersomeness score 5 on a 0-10 scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main results were these:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * There was &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;no difference&lt;/span&gt; between individualised acupuncture, standardised acupuncture, or sham acupuncture.&lt;br&gt;    * RMDQ scores fell from 11 to 6 for acupuncture of any sort by 52 weeks, compared with 7.9 for usual care. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Any form of acupuncture was better than usual care&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;    * Bothersomeness scores fell from 5 to 3-5 to 4 for all four groups, with no difference between them.&lt;br&gt;    * &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Use of medications (about 65% at baseline) fell to 47% with acupuncture&lt;/span&gt;, but remained at 59% with usual care.&lt;br&gt;    * There was no difference in SF-36 mental and physical component scores.&lt;br&gt;    * Cutting down on usual activities for more than seven days in the last month at 52 weeks was more common with usual care (18%) than with acupuncture.&lt;br&gt;    * More participants with usual care missed work or school for more than a day (16%) than with acupuncture (5%-10%).&lt;br&gt;    * &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;There was no difference in total costs of back related health services between groups ($160-$221), though costs of acupuncture were not included.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Adverse events occurred in 12/315 with real acupuncture, compared with 0/162 for simulated acupuncture, with one serious adverse event for real acupuncture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * One patient in the usual care group went on to have back surgery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a few interesting things that came out of the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The difference between standard care and intervention is significant, and confirms &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/my-placebo-programme-on-bbc-radio-4/"&gt;previous discussions&lt;/a&gt; suggesting the more theatrical the intervention the larger the placebo effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondy, the cost comparison is interesting - no real cost difference, and indeed acupuncture costs weren't included. So even the 'cost effective' argument is unfounded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirdly, adverse effects - one serious adverse effect and 12 lesser, compared with zero for the toothpicks. This means about 4% of the patients had an adverse effect from a treatment which had absolutely no demonstrable benefit compared to toothpickery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let's see: there's no patient benefit, no cost benefit and increased risk of adverse effects. So why are &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8068427.stm"&gt;NICE approving it&lt;/a&gt; for lower backpain? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps I'll drop them a line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(How long do you reckon it'll be before a quackupuncturist declares that this proves acupuncture works, and the toothpicks were "accidently" letting the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Qi &lt;/span&gt;energy move as it should?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-1237214399622418256?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248021830854"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-748710693991904974">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8d8d2cd8ccc8b96</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Web Site Story</title><published>2009-07-19T16:11:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T16:33:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/web-site-story.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/748710693991904974/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=748710693991904974" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> I have a confession to make.

For an idea about what the anthology is like, consider that all the contributors are male and that the youngest of them was born in 1947. For an idea about me, consider that I would happily have read all 866 pages of it already in my later teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading this book, I'm struck yet again by the difference between knowledge "on good authority" and scientific knowledge. Throughout the European and Islamic Middle Ages, throughout the millennia of Chinese civilisation, ancient texts were preserved and copied largely because they were believed to contain valuable timeless knowledge about the world. In a few cases, like those of Euclid on geometry and Ptolemy on geography and astronomy, this was true to some extent. But in most cases the old authors, like Galen on medicine, did not actually have anything truly useful to say about how the world works. Before the scientific revolution of the 17th century, though, people had no good way to test that. They believed in the best authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radical proposition at the heart of empirical science is that there are no good authorities. It doesn't matter what anyone said about the world a hundred or a thousand or five thousand years ago, except in the rare case when someone observed a nova in the 11th century. Observation rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus the texts that were once held to describe the material world are now studied mainly for what they can tell us about the world of ancient thought. To the extent that they are mined for data on the real world, it is by historians studying the time of their writing. This is a tiny business at today's universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a writer, it is of course sad to think that one day nobody will care about your work. But I feel even more sorry for those manuscript-copying monks who helped transmit the ancient texts up to the invention of printing. They must have believed that the works were really important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/the_knowledge_of_the_ancients.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/JChf4mdRSmg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248017987809"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/palcast_13_medicine_communicat.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcefe6f7ba02e4c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="PalCast"/><title type="html">PalCast 13: Medicine, Communication, Quackery, and Death</title><published>2009-07-19T14:59:39Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T14:59:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/EsR_q6OUN2I/palcast_13_medicine_communicat.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/palcast_13_medicine_communicat.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/WhiteCoatUndergroundPodcast"&gt;the new PalCast&lt;/a&gt; is finally up.

The report is a bit confused, but it seems that a farmer, one of his cousins, or a hired hand fired a shotgun over the heads of a group of Norwegian tourists who had come to see a recent crop circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do such a thing? Simple, he says. He was defending his property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One onlooker was surprised to come under fire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been visiting crop circles for a decade and have in various ways been told that we are not welcome, but this is the first time I have been threatened with a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers have the right to protect their land, but they have no legal right to threaten people. It was totally unnecessary and incredibly scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;So, let me get this straight... she knows she's not welcome, and admits that famers have a right to protect their land, but these realizations aren't enough for her to stop trampling people's crops.

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt; did get an offer on our house, but it’s contingent on our being out of the house by July 30th. So, I am a bit frantic trying to manage both packing and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also hard to leave a garden that I’ve been tweaking for over 6 years, and that is really at it’s peak this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a mixture of &lt;a title="false indigo" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/2196722296/in/set-72157600571598984/"&gt;native prairie plants&lt;/a&gt; and some prettier exotics to keep something in bloom as early as possible. It’s also frustrating that all the tomatoes and other veggies I planted this year haven’t really started to set fruit because of the cold summer we’re having.  (I do have a lot of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3732524806/in/photostream"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt;, though!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will miss my house, but I also am relieved to not be driving across the state every morning and night.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/sets/72157600571598984/"&gt;&lt;img title="Bug House" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2024/2113746381_fab57d9ba3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I will definitely miss all the money I threw into it and that is gone forever too, but mostly….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbye my lovely house and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/sets/72157600571598984/"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We were promised the most haunted locations in Las Vegas as well as compelling evidence for the existence of ghosts. What we got was a tour of places in Vegas where bad things happened and photographs with orbs and flashback. Overall it was pretty lame, but it was a little fun going with a bunch of skeptics.&lt;img style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px" title="ghost-tour-2" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ghost-tour-2.jpg" alt="ghost-tour-2" width="210" height="307"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tour guide was an interesting character. I got the vibe from him that this was just a gig - he was “cast” in the part because of his looks. He claimed to have been a mortician, but that was probably just part of his persona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claimed that he did not really believe in ghosts until he started seeing all the pictures of orbs and “ectoplasm” taken by the people on the tour. Apparently that was the compelling evidence we were promised. When we tried to engage with him gently on a couple of points, his response was “I don’t know, I’m just a tour guide,” - not the response of a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px" title="ghost-tour-1" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ghost-tour-1.jpg" alt="ghost-tour-1" width="224" height="337"&gt;At the beginning of the tour we were all given dowsing rods - these were for dowsing for ectoplasm, or ghost energy. We were informed that if the rods move to the left, that means there is ghost energy; to the right - energy, if they cross then that is also energy, an if only one moves that is (you guessed it) more energy. Of course, it was nearly impossible to keep the rods from moving for any length of time, unless you locked them in place by squeezing them or placing your thumb on top, which we were instructed not to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob tried his luck dowsing for water, and was very successful (he even did it with his eyes closed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at a park where an 11 year old boy was struck by a car and killed, we were told to get out &lt;img style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px" title="ghost-tour-3" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ghost-tour-3.jpg" alt="ghost-tour-3" width="240" height="271"&gt;our dowsing rods and start searching for energy. Evan, who is as much an expert in dowsing as anyone, was the first to find something, although he informed us that he was dowsing for concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, we were unable to locate the promised spirits in the park - no free-floating phantasms, no mysterious figures who suddenly disappear, not even a lonely orb. I think the problem was that there was nothing to provide for orbs or flashback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbs are circular globes of light that appear on pictures, although were not visible when the picture was taken. They are typically caused by motes of dust refracting light. The park was not terribly dusty. There is also a phenomenon known as lens flare, which creates concentric rings extending from a light source - often used for artistic effect in photographs and cinematography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking photographs in a dark environment using a flash, a foreground object can cause flashback, overexposing the film or sensor  causing a blotchy light areas. The random blobs of light, usually amorphous, sometimes stringy, create the perfect raw material for pareidolia. Our brains try to find patterns in the randomness, and if you want to see ghosts, you are very likely to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px" title="ghost-tour-4" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ghost-tour-4-300x225.jpg" alt="ghost-tour-4" width="270" height="203"&gt;Bob managed to capture an excellent example of flashback. This was taken at the Flamingo near a monument to Bugsy Siegel, and close to where he was murdered. You can see the free-floating “ectoplasm” just to the right of the palm tree. This blob looks like a head, facing to the right. The nose is the most striking feature. I thought is looked like a bald head - like a member of the Blue Man group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the tour we were all sleeping in the back of the bus - partly due to the fact that were were still on  East Coast time, so it was about 3AM biological time for us. The tour was less than riveting, although we did have some fun with it. We didn’t see any ghosts, or any compelling evidence. We were treated to ghost stories and photographic artifact only. But we still got to see some of the more tragic side of Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The work described in that earlier post was done surprisingly quickly - in about a year - so I decided to do some more for my Masters Thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious next thing to do was to expose the quail to T-cycles, i.e., non-24h cycles.  This is some arcane circadiana, so please refer to the series of posts on entrainment from yesterday and the two posts on seasonality and photoperiodism posted this morning so you can follow the discussion below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were three big reasons for me to attempt the T-cycle experiment at that time:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/phase-response_curve_and_t-cyc.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/phase-response_curve_and_t-cyc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Zg7_lScNHUY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248004217115"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/19/why-is-science-important/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7ead33669aa53e47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Society"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">Why is Science Important?</title><published>2009-07-19T11:06:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T11:06:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/19/why-is-science-important/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If the world contained more teachers (and certainly more physics teachers) like &lt;a href="http://www.labreporter.com/About%20Alom.html"&gt;Alom Shaha&lt;/a&gt;, I, for one, would be delighted. Shaha teaches in an inner city school in London, and I’m sure he does an excellent job there. But remarkably, beyond this, he clearly pours all his available free time, wherever overworked teachers find that, into public science education. As far as I can tell he focuses on television, and works very closely with scientists to bring their work to his students, and the general public. And he is wonderfully successful at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should have known about Shaha for a long time, particularly looking back at some of his earlier projects, such as &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/seed_short_film_lords_of_the_ring/"&gt;an early film&lt;/a&gt; (which I think I saw, but didn’t know who was behind), three years ago, about the LHC. But he’s on my radar now because I’ve just finished watching his half-hour film &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyscience.co.uk/"&gt;Why is Science Important?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NjNF4rPDtuQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clip I’ve embedded above is just the very beginning of the film - the entire thing can be watched on &lt;a href="http://whyscience.co.uk/"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;, in HD. It contains interviews with scientists, science educators, science communicators, and others; all giving their personal take on the question posed in the film’s title. The responses are diverse, as are, refreshingly, the participants. But if there is a common theme it isn’t that science can tell us how the universe evolved, or what describes the behavior of protons. Rather it is that science is about how to go about seeking the answers to questions, and how to evaluate the claims of others. This last point is hammered home repeatedly, not least in Shaha’s opening monologue above, where, after walking over a bed of glowing coals, he says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve just seen me walk across red hot coals, at a temperature of over five hundred degrees Celsius. I could tell you that I’m an expert in an ancient form of meditation that lets me block out pain at will. I could then tell you that you could lead a happier life if you follow my teachings. For a small fee, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, I could tell you the truth; that walking on hot coals doesn’t require any kind of magical powers. It’s just the case that the coals are a poor conductor of heat, and I walk so quickly that there’s hardly any time for heat transfer to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating truth from fraudulent mumbo-jumbo is just one reason why science is important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects like this don’t change the world on their own, of course. But as part of a common goal of bringing a passion for science to the public, and allowing them to see that its practitioners and enthusiasts are drawn from all walks of life they play an important role; not only for science, but for our increasingly science-dependent society. It doesn’t hurt that Shaha is young and good-looking, but what shines through is his infectious energy and enthusiasm for science and the important role of skepticism. And that’s what I hope anyone watching this film takes away.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1248002503642"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-1110133125280138705">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da9bcbd1c7f81d8d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="freedom of expression" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Crap Libel Cases" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Nick Cohen" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Libel and the Mathematicians</title><published>2009-07-19T10:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T10:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/07/libel-and-mathematicians.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">There is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/19/mathematicians-libel-law"&gt; a great article in today's Observer&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Cohen on how even mathematicians feel libel chill.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-1110133125280138705?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247994966113"><id gr:original-id="http://spirochetesunwound.blogspot.com/2009/07/stari-or-masters-disease-more-like-lyme.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/744227fcf3f0f2eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">STARI or Master&amp;#39;s disease: More like Lyme than Lyme?</title><published>2009-07-19T04:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T04:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/2BjlYLdeix8/stari-or-masters-disease-more-like-lyme.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://spirochetesunwound.blogspot.com/2009/07/stari-or-masters-disease-more-like-lyme.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A tick-borne illness has been masquerading as Lyme disease in the southern United States over the past two decades. Victims first notice the expanding "bulls-eye" skin rash that is similar in appearance to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_chronicum_migrans"&gt;erythema migrans&lt;/a&gt; (EM) of Lyme disease.  However, the tick that feeds on the victim is not the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ixodes&lt;/span&gt; tick that causes Lyme disease but the Lone Star tick &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Amblyomma americanum&lt;/span&gt;.  Moreover, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt;, the Lyme disease spirochete, is not the infectious agent.  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt; has never been successfully cultured from a southern case of the EM-like rash, and serum from most of these patients test negative for Lyme disease by CDC criteria.  Lyme disease itself is uncommon in the south as the resident &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ixodes&lt;/span&gt; ticks rarely feed on humans; most ticks found attached to humans residing in the south are the Lone Star tick, which is unlikely to harbor or transmit &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmCu0Ux03QI/AAAAAAAAAGc/FGW_6wGel4w/s1600-h/AmblyommaAmericanum%28CDC%29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:200px;height:190px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmCu0Ux03QI/AAAAAAAAAGc/FGW_6wGel4w/s200/AmblyommaAmericanum%28CDC%29.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name bestowed upon the condition, "southern tick-associated rash illness" or STARI, is misleading because the territory of the Lone Star tick has been creeping into the northeastern and northern U.S., where Lyme disease is hyperendemic.  The illness has also been dubbed "Masters disease" to honor Dr. Edwin Masters, who passed away last month.  Dr. Masters' observations of skin rash patients in his private practice in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Girardeau,_Missouri"&gt;Cape Girardeau&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri sparked the contentious CDC investigation that led to the first detailed description of STARI 14 years ago.  You can read about &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emerging-diseases/200906/rebel-cause-the-incredible-dr-masters-part-1"&gt;his battles with the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in a series of blog posts by Pamela Weintraub, author of the book &lt;cite&gt;Cure Unknown, Inside the Lyme Epidemic&lt;/cite&gt; (a book I hope to read some day).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmH19i0BTlI/AAAAAAAAAGk/4xDH4W3XbXM/s1600-h/Masters08-f1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:500px;height:185px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmH19i0BTlI/AAAAAAAAAGk/4xDH4W3XbXM/s400/Masters08-f1.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%"&gt;Fig. 1 from Masters &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;., 2008.  Lone Star tick territory in green.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the erythema migrans of most Lyme disease patients does not present as a bull's-eye. In fact, in one study the EM-like rashes in Masters' STARI patients were  much more likely to appear as a bull's-eye than the EM of Lyme disease patients from New York.  In addition, the STARI patients were less likely than those with Lyme disease to suffer from accompanying symptoms such as joint and muscle aches, fatigue, headache, and stiff neck. A question that remains unresolved is whether arthritic, neurologic, or cardiac symptoms can crop up later, as they do in those afflicted with Lyme disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmKXh_P1rOI/AAAAAAAAAGs/d9c63TX6zxA/s1600-h/Masters08-f2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:389px;height:400px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmKXh_P1rOI/AAAAAAAAAGs/d9c63TX6zxA/s400/Masters08-f2.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%"&gt;Figure 2 from Masters &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;., 2008.  EM-like skin lesions in Missouri STARI patients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agent of STARI has eluded scientists. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Borrelia lonestari&lt;/span&gt; was suspected at one time when it was detected by PCR in one patient and the Lone Star tick attached to his skin.  (The spirochete could not be cultured since it does not grow in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Borrelia&lt;/span&gt; culture medium.)  However, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. lonestari&lt;/span&gt; could not be detected in a later study of a series of Masters' STARI patients.   Thus, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. lonestari&lt;/span&gt; is unlikely to bring about most cases of STARI.  The failure to identify the infectious agent of STARI has led some to question whether STARI has an infectious cause.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Masters was convinced that a spirochete, perhaps one closely related to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt;, was the agent of STARI.  He has offered the following observations as evidence:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirochetes have been observed in Lone Star ticks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forms resembling spirochetes have been observed by silver staining of the EM-like skin lesions from Masters' STARI patients (see figure below).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extracts of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt; reacted with sera from some STARI patients in ELISA tests, although the sera were Western blot negative according to CDC criteria.  This observation indicates that antibodies were elicited proteins closely related to those found in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmKsgiULkAI/AAAAAAAAAG0/TWwN5bzcqtg/s1600-h/Masters98-f8.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:383px;height:198px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VK7Ds3Pm-n4/SmKsgiULkAI/AAAAAAAAAG0/TWwN5bzcqtg/s400/Masters98-f8.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:78%"&gt;Figure 8 from Masters &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt;., 1998.  Silver stain of skin biopsy of an EM-like rash from a Missouri patient showing an apparent spirochete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Of course these observations are far from definitive proof.  Nevertheless, it is possible that a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Borrelia&lt;/span&gt; spirochete is the culprit of EM-like lesions in the southern U.S.  Like &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. lonestari&lt;/span&gt;, some of these strains may not grow in the standard &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Borrelia&lt;/span&gt; medium used to cultivate &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/span&gt; from the skin rashes of Lyme disease patients.  This would account for the inability of investigators to culture the spirochete from the skin rash of STARI patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, how is STARI treated?  Although the cause of STARI remains unknown, Edwin Masters  declared that &lt;q&gt;Lyme-like illness deserves Lyme-like treatment.&lt;/q&gt; That is, he recommended that antibiotics be administered to STARI patients according to Lyme treatment guidelines.  Whether antibiotics truly help will require a randomized placebo-controlled study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Featured article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Infectious+Disease+Clinics+of+North+America&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.idc.2007.12.010&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=STARI%2C+or+Masters+Disease%3A+Lone+Star+Tick%E2%80%93Vectored+Lyme-like+Illness&amp;amp;rft.issn=08915520&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=22&amp;amp;rft.issue=2&amp;amp;rft.spage=361&amp;amp;rft.epage=376&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0891552007001286&amp;amp;rft.au=MASTERS%2C+E.J.&amp;amp;rft.au=GRIGERY%2C+C.N.&amp;amp;rft.au=MASTERS%2C+R.W.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CMicrobiology"&gt;MASTERS, E.J., GRIGERY, C.N., &amp;amp; MASTERS, R.W.

&lt;p&gt;You see, I could have waited until morning but I felt compelled to call this out here and now.    I spend much of my time here at ScienceBlogs calling out misogyny and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_blogger_on_blogger_violenc.php#comment-1784372"&gt;I thought that Ed Brayton was my ally&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I was sorely mistaken.  Earlier &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/07/desert_island_jazz.php#more"&gt;Ed posed the following&lt;/a&gt; to his handful of readers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;D.A. Ridgely &lt;a href="http://www.positiveliberty.com/2009/07/all-that-jazz.html#more-4645"&gt;has post at Positive Liberty&lt;/a&gt; about jazz and it sort of hints at the famous desert island question: If you were trapped on a desert island, what jazz albums would you want with you? He immediately suggests Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and I agree unequivocally. And he's right about the specific song So What on that album as well. And he posts a youtube video with just the audio from that song, which I'll reproduce below. I'll add a few suggestions of my own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a lover of good jazz I went through Ed's suggestions and noticed one thing.  A lot of penis.  Every single person Ed suggested has a penis.  Come on, Ed.  Surely we can try harder to be inclusive, right?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case the lovely Dr. Brayton has a hard time thinking up a famous jazz musicians lacking in scrotums, allow me to suggest a few:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/misogyny_where_you_least_expec.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/misogyny_where_you_least_expec.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/ulI7aJbg6ws" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247987125698"><id gr:original-id="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/?p=809">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9437b25f1977ff5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">“News Networks Responsible for Poor Science Literacy, study says”</title><published>2009-07-19T06:27:24Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T06:27:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/07/19/news-networks-responsible-for-poor-science-literacy-study-says/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/07/congrats_on_the_transformation.php#comment-1764614"&gt;Mooneytits and Cockenbaum&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/07/18/greetings-to-pzs-evil-minions"&gt;my sudden&lt;/a&gt;, though I am sure, transient, celebrity, I haven’t really talked much about an issue I’ve been meaning to for a very, very long time. That is, the quality of science journalism. There are a few science journalists who do their homework sufficiently to write both an entertaining and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31949660/ns/technology_and_science-science/"&gt;educational piece&lt;/a&gt; on science. Some have even written &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393334791/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=304485901&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=0393064646&amp;amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=11GJHEKDMESB4TD875JS"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Disgust-William-Ian-Miller/dp/0674031555/ref=cm_lmf_tit_1"&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stiff-Curious-Lives-Human-Cadavers/dp/0393324826/ref=cm_lmf_tit_6"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not at all boring or dull, ok, that’s a lie; some parts are boring and dull and only someone with a twisted and &lt;a href="http://www.mrwiggleslovesyou.com/"&gt;deranged mind&lt;/a&gt; would find it remotely interesting. *twitch*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with much of science journalism is that it is sensationalized to the point of being inaccurate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/06/green_tea_component_kinda_help.php"&gt;HIV Risk Decreased by Green Tea&lt;/a&gt;! (Thanks for covering it, ERV, but here’s what &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/05/19/health/webmd/main5025620.shtml"&gt;CBS News had to say&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Missing-Link-Scientists-In-New-York-Unveil-Fossil-Of-Lemur-Monkey-Hailed-As-Mans-Earliest-Ancestor/Article/200905315284582?lpos=World_News_Carousel_Region_0&amp;amp;lid=ARTICLE_15284582_Missing_Link%3A_Scientists_In_New_York_Unveil_Fossil_Of_Lemur_Monkey_Hailed_As_Mans_Earliest_Ancestor"&gt;Missing Link Found&lt;/a&gt;! (Brian Switek of Laelaps wrote &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6360606.ece"&gt;an article on this&lt;/a&gt; for the Times).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside fromt he problems with each of these journalism pieces, I find myself upset by the fact that these journalists, with an audience eager to consume science news, do not appear remotely interested in accuracy, but in marketability of that which they are reporting. Giving dissenting views on highly controversial subjects within science is necessary, giving dissenting views on science from nonscientific and religiously, politically, or financially motivated groups is something completely different. Sitting a single research in a room with three or four pseudo-philosophical wack jobs which claim absolute authority on truth&lt;sup&gt;tm&lt;/sup&gt; does not help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing in more experts in a field (such as having another evolutionary biologist specializing in primates) or another HIV researcher can, and does allow the parsing of potentially biased views. It takes work and time, but I think the payoff for the public, a more objective, entertaining, and informative scientific media, is well worth it. If not, blogs such as &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/"&gt;The Loom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Bad Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/"&gt;NeuroLogica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, and so forth will continue invading the Normandy which is science news. Attend a research conference or two where two scientists with competing theories are present, I promise you won’t leave unentertained by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what does all this mean about the discussion of accommodationists with “New Atheists.” Answer: not a damn thing. Science should not accommodate ANY view. If a group of scientists demonstrates today, with a well substantiated claim that the Earth exists within the left meatball of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and this is reproduced by another, independent group of scientists, so be it, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is real, and the Invisible Pink Unicorn (Peace Be Unto Her) (May Her Holy Hooves Never Be Shod) must be moved to a far higher state of existence than previously thought, after all, She IS greater than the Flying Spaghetti Monster, therefore must be larger. The point is this, religions must accommodate science, not the other way around. Political ideologies must also accommodate science, not the other way around. Using only the aspects of science which you like (computers, for example) and ignoring the parts you don’t like (evolution, medicine, and neurobiology come to mind) is like asking for a tomato-basil sandwich, but you only want the salt. There is so much more to science now than the little bit you agree with. Some of it will offend people, some of it will tell us &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/oh_no_monkeys_are_smarter_than.php"&gt;we’ve been doing things wrong&lt;/a&gt; this whole time. That’s the point, to tell us what of our opinions are inconsistent with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s really what they’re saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/18/christians-say-virgin-mary-is-piece-of-crap/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ye3Xg-kYoio/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, it’s yet another example of pareidolia, the psychological phenomenon where one sees patterns where there none exist. And of course &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/looking_for_the_virgin_mary_in_all_the_w.php"&gt;Jesus and the Virgin Mary are two of the most popular patterns people see&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;like seeing Elvis in a flame or the Virgin Mary on a &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/04/virgin-mary-appears.html"&gt;stain under a freeway overpass&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago or in a &lt;a href="http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/v05/rnd05_40.shtml"&gt;window blotch in Perth Amboy&lt;/a&gt;, or seeing Jesus on a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4172689.stm"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;, on the wall of a &lt;a href="http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:CnvGX-0G9rwJ:www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp%3FARTICLE_ID%3D44986+jesus+on+toast&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=9&amp;amp;client=safari"&gt;shower&lt;/a&gt;, on a &lt;a href="http://www.googlesightseeing.com/?p=399"&gt;sand dune&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_1423248.html"&gt;potato chip&lt;/a&gt;,  or (my personal favorite) a &lt;a href="http://www.wtol.com/Global/story.asp?S=3703786"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pierogi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, there have even been Jesus sightings on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/all_hail_the_jesus_cat.php"&gt;a cat&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/still_more_weekend_pareidolia_lookin_for.php"&gt;stain on a ceiling tile&lt;/a&gt;, and even on a rather &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/the_best_jesus_pareidolia_yet.php"&gt;odd location on a dog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not uncommon for alleged ghost hunters to hear ghostly voices in electronic recordings. They call it Electronic Voice Phenomenon. It’s really just audio pareidolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my personal favorite pareidolia was the &lt;a href="http://jontownsend.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/jesus-toast1.jpg"&gt;Jesus Toast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"Bureaucratic pain" is the phrase that Tory leader David Cameron used (see the July 16th &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/16/cameron-ivan-disability-conservatives"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;) to describe the seemingly endless paperwork and protocols, assessments and waiting lists, that parents of disabled children and persons with disabilities face left and right. Take a quick tour of news stories about autism and not only is it apparent that getting access to services and programs is as much a Herculean task as figuring out what services and programs are needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kennewick, Washington, the July 18th &lt;a href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com/kennewick_pasco_richland/story/651117.html"&gt;TriCity Herald&lt;/a&gt; reports on the additional challenges faced by Hispanic families whose children have been diagnosed with autism, from language barriers to different cultural understandings, and misunderstandings, of autism. Families move from town to town and state to state (like &lt;a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-autistic-move-071809,0,584149.story"&gt;this Florida family&lt;/a&gt;, who is moving to New York) in the hope that services will be better funded and simply better, and more accessible. And as noted yesterday in a post on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/homelessness_disability"&gt;homelessness and disability&lt;/a&gt;, programs and initiatives exist, but are those in need able to access them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Cameron's 6-year-old son &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/26/david-cameron-ivan"&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt; had the neurological disorder &lt;a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/ohtahara/ohtahara.htm"&gt;Ohtahara syndrome &lt;/a&gt; and, very sadly, passed away in February, as noted in the July 16th &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/16/cameron-ivan-disability-conservatives"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he and his wife Samantha were not only "deeply shocked, worried and upset" when told of Ivan's condition, but also "incredibly confused". He adds: "It feels like you're on the beginning of a journey you never planned to take, without a map or a clue which direction to go in."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also repeats a pledge to halt the closure of special schools and make it easier for parents to get the education they need. "So many parents get stuck on a merry-go-round of assessments, appeals and tribunals to get a statement of special needs and the extra help their child needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a structural reason for that. The people that decide who gets specialist education – local education authorities – are the ones who pay for it. We're seriously looking at how we can resolve that conflict of interest, so parents don't have to enter such a huge battle for special education."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While things aren't set up in quite the same way in the US, bureacratic hoops seem inevitable. It's not that you just get your child evaluated and diagnosed and figure out what to do, but then you have to wait and, too, to talk to all sorts of people who aren't in charge and have been answering calls all day from people in your situation and while I'm not saying they don't care, you and your child are just another case to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what your child really is, as noted in the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/26/david-cameron-ivan"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron once said his family often talked about whether it would have been better to let Ivan die. But friends say the Camerons are in no doubt that they were blessed with a boy who, despite his profound disability, was intelligent and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ivan had a wonderful gentle aura with extraordinary eyes," one friend said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And without getting too over-sentimentalizing, I have to say that my son has such, too and that's why one is always willing to go through bureaucratic pain---and it's also why we need to end it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247978585125"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1436be78592adc0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Michael Jackson at 40</title><published>2009-07-19T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/people/jackson40.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Image from 1985 shows a magazine's projection of what Michael Jackson would look like at age 40</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247978423263"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/lady_gaga_solicits_leftovers_f.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/529454d008754235</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Lady GaGa Solicits Leftovers from 8th Grade Science Classes...</title><published>2009-07-19T04:49:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T04:49:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/tCvURRUOTso/lady_gaga_solicits_leftovers_f.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/lady_gaga_solicits_leftovers_f.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...and turns them into a beautiful frock and hair accessory.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the best skeptical work on the Bible as a whole. Gerd Lüdemann, author of several skeptical works on early Christianity, recommends it &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/paulntobin/foreword.html"&gt;“with the utmost enthusiasm.”&lt;/a&gt; I do too.&lt;span&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tobin’s whole argument is aimed to show that Pascal’s famous wager has no effect on us because we are not forced to choose between Pascal’s Catholic brand of Christianity and unbelief. Why? Because the central claims of Christianity are false. He takes aim at the Bible to show that while it may be a great work of literature it is not the word of God. And Tobin backs his claim up with his massive 652 page book, complete with a nice bibliography and indexes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re a former Christian who has deconverted at a later time in life then you need to re-learn most all of what you were taught about the Bible. If you were college and seminary trained like me, this can be a difficult thing to do. So, you could go on a massive reading binge, spending many hours and a lot of money feasting on book after book. Or, you could read this one. Given that choice I highly recommend you get this one. Tobin masterfully takes us through the Bible using critical scholarship to show us what we can and cannot know about it. It has helped me remember several things I learned back in college and seminary but had forgotten. It taught me some very interesting things I hadn’t yet thought through as a skeptic, and I think I’ve read a great deal on the subject since my deconversion. Tobin showed me I hadn’t read enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s all here for the most part in an encyclopedic fashion, covering the ancient myths, the errors, the lack of confirming archaeology, the failed prophecies, and the forged authorship. He also covers the &lt;em&gt;ad hoc &lt;/em&gt;canonization process and the textual transmission of these texts. Tobin is a very good guide to these topics, using the results of critical scholars whom he refers to time and again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He writes and thinks well too. Take for instance Noah’s Ark. Tobin tells us simply that on the one hand “it is too big,” in that the structure could not be seaworthy. On the other hand “it was too small,” with not enough room for all of the animals it would have had in it. (pp. 75-77). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tobin also spends a few pages effectively dealing with the minutia of numerical “contradictions” in the Bible, like the value of π (pi) found in Kings 7:23-26 (pp. 29-38). He even shows how that the evangelical &lt;em&gt;New International Version &lt;/em&gt;has purposely mistranslated several passages to eliminate the appearance of difficulties inherent in the original languages (pp. 197-204). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he addresses how the liberals view the Bible by concluding that they “did not reach their conclusions by abstruse theological reasoning: they were forced by external circumstances—the findings of science, comparative religions, enlightenment philosophies and historical criticism.” (pp. 187-196).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to know why scholars think the Gospel of Mark was written first you may only need to read this book. If you want to know why scholars don’t think Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are the authors of their gospels, and why they are written later than evangelicals claim, you may only need to read this book. If you want to know why the Nativity stories are fictions you may only need to read this book. If you want to know why scholars have serious doubts about what Jesus may have said, or why they doubt the Passion Narratives and resurrection stories, you may only need to read this book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have only one skeptical book about the Bible as a whole this one is all you need. And even if you have some other books, this one will still inform you of issues you probably haven’t read up on, like it did with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tobin did a massive amount of work here. I will use it as a reference when dealing with some of these topics in the future. It’s worth the price. I liked it so much I asked Tobin to write a chapter for &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-ive-been-somewhat-quiet-lately.html"&gt;a book I’ve been editing/writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5691911835370431024?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

One cleric in Rome, Monsignor Rino Fisichella, said the church had been insensitive, but no one in the hierarchy stepped forward to outright condemn the heartlessness of the church's stance and the unfairness of the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have an official document from the Catholic church clearly stating their position. &lt;a href="http://thewelltimedperiod.blogspot.com/2009/07/pope-benedict-xvis-final-word-on-case.html"&gt;Anyone involved in an abortion for any reason is to be automatically excommunicated, no exceptions&lt;/a&gt;. They've actually hardened their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That includes nine-year old children raped by their stepfather. It includes any doctors who act on sympathy for a maltreated child. Of course, all the rapist has to do is demand that his victim bear his child, and he will be welcomed in the bosom of the holy church. The church is &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20090718/wl_time/08599191149500"&gt;standing firm on principle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…there is a more important principle at stake. &amp;quot;We have laws, we have a discipline, we have a doctrine of the faith,&amp;quot; the official says. &amp;quot;This is not just theory. &lt;b&gt;And you can't start backpedaling just because the real-life situation carries a certain human weight.&lt;/b&gt;" Benedict makes it ever more clear that his strict approach to doctrine will remain a central pillar to his papacy, bad publicity be damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see. Dogma is more important than reality, and most surprisingly for representatives of a religion that claims the moral high ground, it is more important than human needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone should simply leave that evil institution — tell them they can keep their bricks and their real estate, their gold chalices and their gilt robes, their layered assemblage of celibate perverts, meddling old men, and fearful brides of Christ, and let that human element walk away, free of their superstitions. The church doesn&amp;#39;t want that &lt;i&gt;human weight&lt;/i&gt;, anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/that_inhuman_monolith.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Rh4P9pHYerI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247968882984"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13909">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fade524ed8ef345</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">How to Transition from Godless to Godly</title><published>2009-07-19T02:00:33Z</published><updated>2009-07-19T02:00:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/18/how-to-transition-from-godless-to-godly/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troy Conrad&lt;/strong&gt; is offering suggestions to those atheists who find themselves becoming religious, but who are &lt;a href="http://metrostateatheists.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/an-atheist%E2%80%99s-guide-to-becoming-religious/"&gt;not sure how to make that transition happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As freethinkers, we’ve gotten a bit rusty in the worship department.  When working out the faith muscle, we must start slowly so it doesn’t get overtaxed.  Start out at the Joel Osteen level, before you consider going full Falwell.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Use the “caps lock” on your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;  Many atheists are prone to using a lower case “g” when typing the word “God.”  This habit, left unchecked, is an embarrassing mistake for the newly anointed.  Using the caps lock is a foolproof solution, making it impossible to mess up a phrase such as:  “MAY GOD BLESS E. E. CUMMINGS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a night of gay sex.&lt;/strong&gt; If you end up liking it, you will meet more people to share your faith with.  If you end up disliking it, then your repentance and faith will just get stronger.  Either way, God wins.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, he forgot to mention burning all the evil science textbooks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the evil library books.  &lt;/p&gt;

And we’ve had a few fights concerning Ned (”You yelled too loud at him!” “He has to learn not to do that!”). But it does seem that most of our arguments stem from autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/mad-cat.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of Elsie esq. (flickr.com)" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of Elsie esq. (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other night, Alex was wilder than usual. Running around, screaming and laughing, chattering. After about 20 minutes I went to him to see if I could get him to calm down. I brought a scented candle, but just as I was about to bring it closer to his nose, I noticed a gap between teeth on the lower left side. &lt;em&gt;He’s lost a tooth!&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;em&gt;A &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;permanent &lt;/span&gt;tooth!&lt;/em&gt; Deep despair and misery followed instantly. I called to Jeff to come over right away, and he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite using the Water-pik and helping him brush (as much as he will let us — he’s very insistent that he do certain things himself) I imagined a long, sad adulthood for Alex with at least one missing tooth. An implant seemed expensive and unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff pointed out that it was probably a babytooth. “But he has all his permanent teeth!” I said. Jeff countered that his development is so slow, it’s more than likely NOT permanent. “That has nothing to do with it!” I fired back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fireworks ensued, with angry words and perhaps a slammed door. Did I go into the bedroom and shut the door and cry for a while?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(to be continued…)&lt;/p&gt;

But what happens when that interesting new business turns out to be the subject of a law enforcement probe? Two television stations – one in Tampa, Florida, the other in Austin, Texas, recently learned that credulous news coverage isn’t always a great thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative autism treatment center called &lt;a href="http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/health/entries/2009/07/15/autism_clinic_raided_by_federa.html"&gt;CARE Clinics was raided last week by the FBI and IRS&lt;/a&gt; following reports of widespread insurance fraud. Mary Ann Roser of the &lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt; has been following CARE Clinics at least since May when she reported that &lt;a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/05/03/0503autismclinic.html"&gt;insurance companies were questioning &lt;/a&gt;the clinic’s billing practices. Roser has also written critically about Thoughtful House, another Austin clinic that charges parents for non-evidence based autism treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Austin’s Fox News affiliate, KVET, took the road well traveled. It invited CARE Clinic founder, Kazuko Grace Curtin, onto its morning show for what sounds like an infomercial for quack medicine. At one point Curtin defines autism as “a multi-factorial bio-medical disorder with psychiatric symptoms.” A serious journalist would have first learned the definition of autism while preparing for the interview, then challenged Curtin. An unserious journalist would never notice. The report was credulous enough that Curtin uses a &lt;a href="http://www.mycareclinic.com/index.html"&gt;video of the segment&lt;/a&gt; to promote her business on the CARE website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tampa’s WTSP also fell for Curtin’s call, electing to focus on “a new business in the bay area that puts treatment, research and services for autistic children under one roof.” A phone call to a qualified physician or researcher would likely have revealed that CARE Clinics treatments are not evidence-based, that the research is questionable and most likely aimed at producing a desired result, and that the services included unreliable and unnecessary lab tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Television news has regressed from the days of Walter Cronkhite, who died yesterday at the age of 92. The Most Trusted Man in America, was from an era  when journalists took their jobs seriously, and the line between news and entertainment was discernible, if not clear. Uncle Walter was a gentleman from sole to crown, and his discipline and pitch perfect delivery of the news raised the bar for other broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was too good to last. Cronkite’s DNA is long gone from the news business, replaced by the dominant entertainment gene. Today’s litter of vapid, blow-dried news personalities are focus-group tested for Cronkitian likability, but without the burden of trust and, like, actually knowing what you’re talking about. It’s not what the founding fathers had in mind, 233 years ago, when they included freedom of the press in the first amendment to the Bill of Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public may be lulled to sleep by its journalists, but it is not completely fooled. Poll after poll show the public respects the news media about as much as politicians and mortgage derivative brokers. About ten years ago, news executives fought back with something they called “civic journalism”. Find out what your viewers and readers want, it was decreed, and then give it to them. Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An offshoot of civic journalism is community boosterism, the ultimate in feel-good news reporting that aims to put the community, or a local business, in the best possible light. Boosterism comes in different flavors, from a sugary-sweet report on a local festival, to a content-lite look at a new business. “It wasn’t a story about autism” would be a likely defense for the CARE Clinic story, “we were covering a new business. That’s all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdicating one’s responsibility to accurately inform the public is never a good idea. Giving the owner of an alternative health clinic a free speaking platform is egregious.&lt;/p&gt;

is a &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian"&gt;mammalian&lt;/a&gt; invention, not present in birds, reptiles, or any other &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrates"&gt;vertebrates&lt;/a&gt;.   It&amp;#39;s associated with the increases in intelligence seen in mammals since the end of the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt;, especially in &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primates"&gt;primates&lt;/a&gt;, and more especially in humans.  While there are dozens (probably hundreds) of discussions of the neocortex available on the Web, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find one that meets my needs (for linking to in detailed discussions), so I&amp;#39;m going to produce my own, in the process discussing a recent paper which reflects on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The neocortex develops from a part of the developing &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube"&gt;neural tube&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telencephalic"&gt;telencephalic pallium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#17note715"&gt;[17]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  This is the part of the telencephalon that is towards the back (dorsal) and upper side (dorso-lateral), while the part towards the middle of the body (medial) develops into the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; and some other parts of the brain associated with memory (especially spacial memory) and navigation.  The bottom (ventral) part of the telencephalon develops into the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_nuclei"&gt;basal nuclei&lt;/a&gt;, which "&lt;i&gt;are associated with a variety of functions:  motor control, cognition, emotions, and learning.&lt;/i&gt; [Wiki]"  (The telencephalon is split into two parts, one on each side, a feature not visible in Figure 1.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img style="width:450px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/EmbryonicBrain.svg/710px-EmbryonicBrain.svg.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 1:  Parts of the neural tube.  (From Wiki)&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We'll come back to the neural tube, but for the moment let's take a look at the structure of the neocortex, by comparison with other structures:&lt;span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  those that develop from the medial and ventro-lateral part of the pallium, and those in reptiles such as turtles and lizards (&lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilians"&gt;crocodilians&lt;/a&gt; are too closely related to dinosaurs and birds, and will not be considered) that have been shown to be almost certainly &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homologous"&gt;homologous&lt;/a&gt; to the neocortex:  the dorsal and dorso-lateral cortex.  These latter structures develop from the same part of the pallium in these reptiles as the neocortex does in mammals, and they share many similar connections, so it&amp;#39;s worthwhile drawing parallels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most sites discussing the neocortex will tell you that it has six layers rather than the three found in these other structures, and that the cells mature from the outside in rather than the opposite.  Many will also tell you that incoming &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axons"&gt;axons&lt;/a&gt; arrive from the bottom rather than the top:  that is from the direction of the inside of the neural tube rather than the outside.  All these facts are generally true, although some details are often left out and the language is often obscured by the use of various anatomical terms.  Let&amp;#39;s go over it in detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first difference has to do with the direction of maturity, the fact that cells mature from the outside in.  Neurons in this part of the neural tube are created by cell divisions in the very inner part of the neural tube, called the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tube#Structure"&gt;ventricular zone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#8note715"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  From there, they migrate &lt;b&gt;radially&lt;/b&gt;, towards the outer part of the tube (called the pial surface).  In turtles and lizards, these cells begin by settling in the outer part of what will become the dorsal cortex, and later cells settle inwards of them, closer to the center of the nerual tube.  This is what is meant by outside-in maturation, since once they settle, these cells begin to mature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What most sites discussing the neocortex don't mention is that in the mammalian hippocampus (except for the dentate gyrus) the first cells settle on the inside, closest to the middle of the neural tube, and later cells settle farther out.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#8note715"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  This is exactly what they do in the developing neocortex,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#25note715"&gt;[25]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which means that this change is not limited to the neocortex, but is somewhat more general to the mammalian pallium.  It&amp;#39;s a good guess that it came first, and it allows for a greater thickness of cortex with interconnections, even without the other changes, as is shown by the structure of the hippocampus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next change is the six-layered structure, which arises in the upper dorsal pallium and the dorsal part of the lateral pallium.  This structure probably derives from the more primitive three-layered structure found in turtles, lizards, and the mammalian hippocampus, although the latter has evolved a much thicker outer layer and a characteristic &amp;quot;double-C pattern&amp;quot; with the dentate gyrus curved around the hippocampal gyrus.  The three-layered structure in general is called the &amp;quot;&lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocortex"&gt;allocortex&lt;/a&gt;":  this word specifically stands for the parts of the "&lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; with a three-layered structure, although it&amp;#39;s often used for other areas with the same cortical structure.  (The &amp;quot;cerebral cortex&amp;quot; technically refers to the entire cortical area formed from the pallium, but is often instead mistakenly identified with the neocortex.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We need to start by describing the three-layered structure, then, before we can compare it with the six-layered.  The three layers are like a sandwich, with areas of mostly &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurites"&gt;neurites&lt;/a&gt; (axons, &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrites"&gt;dendrites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapses"&gt;synapses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glial_cells"&gt;glial cells&lt;/a&gt;) making up the bread, while the filling is densely filled with neural cell bodies (&lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_cell#Overview"&gt;somas&lt;/a&gt;).  Most of the neural connections come from the outside (the side away from the center of the primitive neural tube), while in this area most of the axons leaving do so out the bottom (the side towards the center of the neural tube).  This provides for a simple &amp;quot;pass-through&amp;quot; system, in which the nerve cells process the incoming information and produce an output which goes to another brain region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The disadvantage of this system is that the incoming axons are growing along the top of this layer, and trying to make synaptic connections with any cells they encounter.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#8note715"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Since most of these cells don&amp;#39;t want any specific connection, most of these attempts are refused, which constitutes a major waste of resources.  Which leads us to the third difference, which is that many incoming axons from other parts of the brain come from below in mammals, in more evolved mammals, such as primates and carnivores, virtually all.  We&amp;#39;ll discuss this shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before we do so, we need to consider the layers of the neocortex, which are very different from the allocortex.  The layers of the neocortex are usually numbered I through VI (usually using Roman numerals, although many websites use Arabic).  Layer I is almost completely free of neuron somas, being mostly made up of &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropil"&gt;neuropil&lt;/a&gt;, along with blood vessels and other support structures.  Layers II and III have many neuron somas, a good mix of &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cells"&gt;&lt;b&gt;pyramidal cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (see below) and &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneurons"&gt;interneurons&lt;/a&gt;, the latter usually making local connections with their axons as well as their dendrites.  Layer IV is composed of a mix of &lt;b&gt;stellate cells&lt;/b&gt;, which like interneurons make local connections, in the sense that they typically don&amp;#39;t extend their axons out of the area they reside, but they extend much farther than interneurons, and they tend to be exitory rather than inhibitory (see below).  Layers V and VI contain mostly pyramidal cells, although with some interneurons, and the lower part of layer VI often contains a large proportion of neurites, especially axon branches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the allocortex, the majority of the interconnections are in the upper layer, although the lower layer (the one closest to the middle of the...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

More than 40 percent of the homeless population in the US are persons with disabilities, the July 16th &lt;a href="http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/07/16/homeless-report/4153/"&gt;Disability Scoop&lt;/a&gt; reports. The 150-page &lt;a href="http://www.hud.gov/news/release.cfm?content=pr09-108.cfm&amp;amp;CFID=23864232&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=72860161"&gt;2008 Annual Homeless Assessment Report&lt;/a&gt; was issued by the &lt;a href="http://www.hud.gov/homeless/index.cfm"&gt;Department of Housing and Urban Development&lt;/a&gt;. From pp. 27-28:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults, 17.7 percent of the U.S. population had a disability whereas an estimated 42.8 percent of sheltered homeless adults had a disability. A disability, particularly one relating to substance abuse or mental health issues, can make it difficult to work enough to afford housing. Indeed, the higher share of adults with disabilities in the poverty population (30.7 percent) relative to the U.S. population is an indication of this difficulty. &lt;em&gt;People with disabilities are an even higher share of the homeless population than the poverty population, suggesting that disabled persons face additional difficulties in gaining access to permanent housing. People with disabilities may have difficulties searching for a unit or finding a landlord willing to rent to them. Their disability may make it less easy to accommodate them without adaptive supports [my emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the ability of SSI and SSDI to avert homelessness among persons with disabilities is uncertain. In 2009, the average monthly SSI payment was $50416 (or about $6,048 annually) and the poverty rate for a single-person household was $10,830. Accordingly, the average annual SSI payment is about 44 percent below the poverty level, and thus people with disabilities who lack a sufficient work history to qualify for SSDI—common among people with severe mental illness or substance abuse issues—are more susceptible to deep poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the phrases I highlighted from the report suggest, not being able to work (or not being given the opportunity to work regardless of one's skills) can make affording housing difficult (impossible); further challenges remain as far as having access to housing, not to mention housing with accommodations and adaptive supports. Dora has written about the crucial importance of the &lt;a href="http://www.adapt.org/cca.php"&gt;Community Choice Act&lt;/a&gt; in providing long-term in-home supports for persons with disabilities, to provide a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/excluded_from_health_care_reform--and_from_civil_rights"&gt;way out of institutions and nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;. And, too, the reasons for persons with disabilities not working or not looking for work are "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stereotypes_about_not_working"&gt;because they are lazy&lt;/a&gt;" but, for instance, "being unable to both manage basic life activities and work at the same time; i.e. not an issue, just a fact for some." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://homelessness.change.org/blog/view/whats_inside_the_homeless_assessment_report"&gt;Homelessness blog at Change.org&lt;/a&gt; has an additional &lt;a href="http://homelessness.change.org/blog/view/whats_inside_the_homeless_assessment_report"&gt;assessment of the 2008 report&lt;/a&gt; and notes that what especially needs to be looked at is performance. Certainly there are programs and initiatives set up but what is actually working, and what is not?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247957060895"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/yesterday_morning_i_sent_abbie.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8bc4159949c744b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospherics"/><title type="html">"Yesterday morning, I sent Abbie an email ..."</title><published>2009-07-18T21:47:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T21:47:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/kDdspCEvS8I/yesterday_morning_i_sent_abbie.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/yesterday_morning_i_sent_abbie.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are moments when the difference between bloggers who are real writers and who combine amazing talents of observation with careful analysis, thoughtful construction of argument, and clear presentation vs. the rest of us slobs who are just babbling, hoping the commenters will compensate for our slovenliness, becomes painfully obvious.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/yesterday_morning_i_sent_abbie.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/yesterday_morning_i_sent_abbie.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/kDdspCEvS8I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247951807526"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8340">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b4a302ad3e71d37</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">AI: podcasting</title><published>2009-07-18T21:00:02Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T21:00:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8340" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atheists Talk Radio Show has finished its radio contract, and will be rebooted as a podcast.

Why would he let them perish in hell for all eternity (or simply perish) without any hope of redemption? The reason, Christians tell us, is one of respect: God &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;respects &lt;/span&gt;the decision to reject him, and therefore will not devalue this “free choice”—however irrational—by interfering. Below, I show why this answer is problematic.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, the answer assumes that the “free” decision to reject God is worthy of respect, since without this assumption, it is impossible to explain why God would respect it. It makes no sense to say God will respect decisions &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;unworthy&lt;/span&gt; of respect. So what is it about the decision to reject God that is worthy of respect? I see only two possibilities: the decision is either (1) intrinsically respectable or (2) worthy of respect because it is made by a free being who is itself worthy of respect.  No will argue the first possibility. As for the second, the Christian needs to demonstrate the connection between a free agent being worthy of respect and the (irrational) choices she makes being worthy of respect. What is this connection? If I see my friend ready to jump into a volcano, should I “respect” his choice, or attempt to prevent him from making a grave error? The latter, clearly. Thus, I can respect my friend’s worth without having to respect his irrational choices. As the example illustrates, I can even respect my friend’s worth while interfering with his free will.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians will undoubtedly argue that God cannot interfere with the nonbeliever’s free will, despite how she chooses to exercise it. For if God were to not accept the nonbeliever’s irrational choice, he would be devaluing her humanity or intrinsic moral worth.  I’d like to see some justification for this claim, but even supposing the Christian could provide a satisfactory answer, there lies a deeper problem: why would God wish to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;give up&lt;/span&gt; on the nonbeliever? According to Christians, the decision to reject God is indicative of a deep defect in the nonbeliever’s moral and rational faculties. So it is utterly incomprehensible why God would wish to give up on trying to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;correct&lt;/span&gt; this defect. If God thinks the nonbeliever is making the biggest mistake one can possibly make, then it is far more plausible to suppose he would do everything in his power to help her realize her error—reach out to her until she ‘gets it’, no matter how long it takes. Hence, the obvious answer to the question of when God should give up is ‘never.’ It is what a fully compassionate and loving being would do, and therefore what God would do, if he exists. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3032476733594374314?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But what the heck - I got new readers over the past couple of weeks, so better late than never. So here it goes - I posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" title=""&gt;150 times&lt;/a&gt; in June. Here are some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I announced my plans for the trip &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/trip_to_germany_and_serbia.php" title=""&gt;to Germany and Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and later added some &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/programing_note_next_two_weeks.php" title=""&gt;more details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/interview_at_nature_network.php" title=""&gt;interviewed by Caryn Shechtman&lt;/a&gt; at Nature Network and later &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/caryn_shechtman_a_blogger_succ.php" title=""&gt;reposted the interview here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the XXVI International Association of Science Parks World Conference on Science &amp;amp; Technology Parks in Raleigh and wrote a longish &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/science_technology_parks_-_wha.php" title=""&gt;post with my thoughts about the future of such physical sci-tech spaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In science news, a beautiful Mammoth fossil was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/a_beautiful_mammoth_fossil_dis.php" title=""&gt;discovered in Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. And Victor Bruce, a pioneer of my field, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/in_memoriam_victor_bruce_1920-.php" title=""&gt;died in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/turtle_in_front_of_my_house.php" title=""&gt;big turtle in front of my house&lt;/a&gt; and a huge &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/name_this_bug.php" title=""&gt;bug on my porch&lt;/a&gt;. I think this was the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/we_report_you_decide.php" title=""&gt;funniest video of the month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First serious, thought-provoking, science-related post of the month was: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/why_or_why_not_cite_blog_posts.php" title=""&gt;Why or why not cite blog posts in scientific papers?&lt;/a&gt;. Then I dissected the Bentham Hoax by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/this_is_an_experiment.php" title=""&gt;using a FriendFeed widget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted the video about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/ethic_of_the_link.php" title=""&gt;Ethic of the Link&lt;/a&gt; as an intro to a very provocative post - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/the_ethics_of_the_quote.php" title=""&gt;The Ethics of The Quote&lt;/a&gt; - which made several journalists' heads explode. I still stand by every word I wrote there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoyed writing the 'ethics of the quote' post and the ensuing discussion in the comments, the best post in June was actually not written by me, but by the Bride Of Coturnix - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/on_being_a_nurse_-_a_guest_pos.php" title=""&gt;On Being a Nurse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 140 Characters conference in NYC, all about Twitter, had a science session of which I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/twitter_and_science_presentati.php" title=""&gt;posted a clip&lt;/a&gt;. Later, I used Twitter to explain Twitter &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/a_quick_introduction_to_twitte.php" title=""&gt;to some business-folks at MIT&lt;/a&gt;. When the election in Iran resulted in government shenanigans and the people's protests, I followed it on Twitter for the first two days or so (while it was still reliable) and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/cnnfail_youtubefail_iranelecti.php" title=""&gt;reposted my tweets here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late June I started the series of interviews with the participants of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/a&gt; - the first interviews were with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_1.php" title=""&gt;Sol Lederman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi.php" title=""&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_2.php" title=""&gt;SciCurious&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_3.php" title=""&gt;Peter Lipson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_interview_with_4.php" title=""&gt;Glendon Mellow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_1.php" title=""&gt;Dr.SkySkull&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set the date for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/scienceonline10_-_mark_your_ca.php" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'10&lt;/a&gt; so mark your calendars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started experimenting with audio (needs more work, now that I am back in the USA) and posted my first &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/clockcast_1.php" title=""&gt;ClockCast&lt;/a&gt;. More will be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the trip, I decided to do my annual Summer Chronobiology Course by reposting &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/chronobiology/clock_tutorials/" title=""&gt;Clock Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; and associated good basic posts about biological clocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the Silence Is The Enemy blogospheric action - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/silence_is_the_enemy.php" title=""&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/silence_is_the_enemy_part_ii.php" title=""&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work-related, I announced the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/the_may_blog_pick_of_the_month.php" title=""&gt;May Blog Pick Of The Month at PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, reminded you of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/journal_clubs_on_plos_one_arti.php" title=""&gt;Journal Clubs&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the must-read article &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/plos_one_background_future_dev.php" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE: Background, Future Development, and Article-Level Metrics&lt;/a&gt;, and introduced the new PLoS Medicine community blog - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/speaking_of_medicine.php" title=""&gt;Speaking of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/lindau_-_i_have_arrived.php" title=""&gt;arrived in Lindau&lt;/a&gt; on the 29th, still exhausted and jet-lagged I went to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/mario_j_molina_talk_about_clim.php" title=""&gt;Mario Molina's talk about Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;, posted brief video interviews with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/lindaunobel_interview_-_wojcie.php" title=""&gt;Wojciech Supronowicz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/lindau_nobel_conference_-_cori.php" title=""&gt;Corinna Reisinger&lt;/a&gt; and then posted about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/lindau_nobel_conference_-_tues.php" title=""&gt;Tuesday events&lt;/a&gt; including my Open Access panel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/the_best_of_june.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/sqvH8zzKRyk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247951342460"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13912">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3826b409b004fcd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Who Are the “New Atheists”?</title><published>2009-07-18T21:00:11Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T21:00:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/18/who-are-the-new-atheists/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The term “New Atheist” is overused… I’m guilty of it, too.  I automatically use it whenever I refer to successful atheist authors, whether or not that’s appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SarahH&lt;/strong&gt; proposes a &lt;a href="http://forum.friendlyatheist.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=1818"&gt;new definition of the term&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A “New Atheist” is an atheist who has somehow pissed off the person using the term “New Atheist.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a more accurate definition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a “New Atheist”?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an atheist in the news these days who isn’t one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any female “New Atheists”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a better term we could use for the new generation of atheists?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A fan of phantom cats? Whatever your favorite cryptid, I urge you to check out &lt;a href="http://www.monstertalk.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monster Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new podcast about cryptozoology. &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/squatchy1-150x150.jpg" alt="Squatchy" width="135" height="135"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, science has a say about the Loch Ness Monster, El Chupacabra and other mysterious beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And maybe even &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SquatchyPants"&gt;Squatchy&lt;/a&gt;, our French Canadian, cross-species molesting  friend!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:2px" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/patterson_bigfoot-209x300.jpg" alt="patterson_bigfoot" width="188" height="270"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster Talk takes cryptozoology to the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;strong&gt;Ben Radford&lt;/strong&gt;, the mysterious &lt;strong&gt;Doctor Atlantis&lt;/strong&gt; (aka &lt;strong&gt;Blake Smith&lt;/strong&gt;) and myself as we interview eminent anthropologists, biologists and other scientists about ‘undiscovered’ creatures and ‘elusive’ species thought to be extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget those blurry photographs and anecdotal evidence, these experts approach the study of cryptozoology with scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.monstertalk.org/wordpress/?p=16"&gt;Episode One&lt;/a&gt; features &lt;strong&gt;Professor Todd Disotell&lt;/strong&gt;, an anthropologist at New York University. Professor Disotell is a DNA expert and primate specialist who has been called upon by various TV shows to analyze samples of alleged sasquatch, big cat, mutant canine and Orang-Pendak DNA. (And he sports a really cool mohawk!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is &lt;strong&gt;Monster Talk&lt;/strong&gt; curious about&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;supposed sea serpents, hairy humanoids and cryptid cats? Aren’t these simply legends and hoaxes? As Professor Disotell explains: &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am either doing good science, finding alternatives, or debunking, or, I have the find of the century.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics are interested in cryptozoology in the spirit of scientific discovery; to prove or disprove individual claims, and simply, because people believe…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us at &lt;a href="http://www.monstertalk.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monster Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for intriguing topics, fascinating guests, surprising finds…and not-so surprising finds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Karen Stollznow</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247948901994"><id gr:original-id="http://www.nasw.org/users/mslong/2009/2009_07/RnaInterference.htm">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/39d02fe402f3c693</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Towards Improving the Therapeutic Potential of RNA Interference</title><published>2009-07-18T14:45:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T14:45:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/Te65g_UQFUw/RnaInterference.htm" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.nasw.org/users/mslong/2009/2009_07/RnaInterference.htm"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Eben Alsberg (Case Western Reserve University, Ohio) and coworkers have applied biodegradable hydrogels for the sustained and local release of interfering RNA, a possible tool for gene silencing.

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt this is true.  Just last weekend I wore my &lt;a href="http://www.scienceteecher.com/black_hole.htm"&gt;Maxwell’s Equations&lt;/a&gt; T-shirt out to a nightclub, and not a single woman remarked on how clever it was.  And to be frank, I’ve had similar experiences with my “&lt;a href="http://www.scienceteecher.com/carbonbased.htm"&gt;Carbon Based And proud of it&lt;/a&gt;!” shirt, with my &lt;a href="http://www.scienceteecher.com/periodic_table_tie_1_largec.htm"&gt;periodic table tie&lt;/a&gt;, and with my “&lt;a href="http://www.scienceteecher.com/Negative_Pressure_shirt.htm"&gt;Negative air pressure differentials SUCK!&lt;/a&gt;” shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And you don’t even want to know about my “&lt;a href="http://shop.neatorama.com/product-info.php?geologists-make-the-bed-rock-pid238.html"&gt;Geologists Make The Bed Rock&lt;/a&gt;” misadventure.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I have lots of good ideas about how to solve this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; bring back “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J933eE0u1CY"&gt;El Mundo de Beakman&lt;/a&gt;”
&lt;li&gt; new CBS drama “Dr. Quinn, Postdoctoral Researcher”
&lt;li&gt; marijuana-growing contests
&lt;li&gt; daily &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_pendulum"&gt;ballistic pendulum&lt;/a&gt; demonstrations in elementary school classrooms
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw"&gt;Tacoma Narrows Bridge&lt;/a&gt; video put into constant rotation on MTV and MTV2
&lt;li&gt; routine in-school showings of pro-biology movies like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld:_Evolution"&gt;Underworld: Evolution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonball_Evolution"&gt;Dragonball Evolution&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; new national anthem: “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IlHgbOWj4o"&gt;She Blinded Me With Science&lt;/a&gt;”
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are great ideas,” you’re thinking, “and I’d love to fund them.  But where’s the &lt;i&gt;debate&lt;/i&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I haven’t read the book &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, but I’m told that the debate lies in chapters 8 and 9: “Why Wicked Scientists Shouldn’t Tell Credulous Believers That Their Religion Is False” and “Why Wicked Bloggers Shouldn’t Tell Credulous Believers That Their Religion Is False.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently (and, again, I’m piecing this together from what I read on a couple of blogs and in &lt;i&gt;TV Guide&lt;/i&gt;), by telling people that science and religion are incompatible, we’re scaring them away from science (but not from religion).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we should be reassuring them that science and religion are perfectly compatible, just as long as they abandon a few ancillary tenets like “our holy scriptures mean what that say” and “god doesn’t have to obey the laws of physics” and “it’s possible to get pregnant without sperm, and also it’s possible (using 1st-century technology) to come back to life after being dead for three days.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’m pretty sure that we’re also not supposed to point out the necessity of throwing out the religious claims.  Better still to trot out &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/2009/07/09/my-first-grant-application-to-the-collins-nih/"&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt; and the BioLogos crew.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, he worked on the &lt;b&gt;Human Genome Project&lt;/b&gt;, so anything he says about science is automatically trustworthy.  And if science and religion are compatible enough for him, then who are we to argue?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247947419240"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/18/why-oh-wyoming/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96b05a8bb0d211b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Why oh Wyoming</title><published>2009-07-18T19:56:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T19:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/18/why-oh-wyoming/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, for certain, among Dr. Isis's top favorite jams of all time.

I think in terms of questions I&amp;#39;ve received, this is one of the more important to the pursuit of a graduate career I have come across and it&amp;#39;s a particular line of thinking I engaged in myself earlier in my career.  So, let&amp;#39;s have a chat about it, dearest readers...
  &lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Dr. Isis Goddess of Domestic and Laboratory Awesome,
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been starring at this screen trying to come up with sufficient adulation for you, but I don't think I have the words; clearly I am not as talented a writer as The Goddess. I am however a great fan of The Goddess with whom I share a love of hot science and ass shaking jams and some experiences of unique hair (ugh). I am a total lurker because I am kind of shy but you have inspired me to try to blog regularly. I often start blogs the same way I started diaries as a girl, "I am going to write in you EVERY day," it goes strong for about two weeks before it's like what blog? When/if I get a good one going I'll let you know, or be way too afraid to let your awesomeness see it...
      &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
      &lt;br&gt; ANYWAY I've been pondering the next step in my education and thought I might take a stab at some advice from Dr. Isis since you are in fact teh awesome. I currently have a BS with okay grades and am working in a lab that has done some big stuff. I want to go on to a Ph.D program but I have too many interests to pick a specific program right now. In the past few months as I work more in the lab I have noticed how much I am lacking in data analysis skills. Why didn't it occur to me when I was still in school that these would be important skills for my future? Hindsight gets clearer everyday! It isn't that I am bad at math, I love math; I just need to get myself more edumucated. I looked into taking courses at the universities near my house and stumbled upon a Masters in Biostatistics at a small state university nearby. It is a dinky masters program with no thesis, only course work and it's fairly cheap. Looking through their course listings I was excited by everything. I really just want to satisfy myself with this, I want to kick ass at the data/mathy stuff so I can focus on doing awesome science in my future. My question to you is if this could make my future grad school applications weaker. Would applying with BS + lab work + dinky MS make me look like I was in fact dinky? Would it be better for me to just be BS + lab work + some post BS classes??? I suppose the best would be BS + lab work + kick ass MS, but I kind of want to do this cheaply on the side to gain the skills while I continue to work in my current lab and figure out my future, I'm not in a full blown big masters program kind of place in my life. Help me Domestic and Laboratory Goddess you're my only hope! Yes I just compared your sage advice to that of Obi Wan, and I'm pretty sure that if anyone were to ever strike you down you would only become more powerful than they could possibly imagine. (Star War references for the win!)
      &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt; ~Just another budding scientist in awe of the goddess&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS- I didn't de-lurk on your, "who are you" post 'cause of the aforementioned shyness, but I shall answer now. You are the second ScienceBlog I ever read and you immediately became my favorite. The first ScienceBlog I found while googling a book, one day while reading that a post of yours was highlighted on the little ScienceBlogs ticker at the top of my screen. I do believe it was something about women in science careers and I, being a vagina owner interested in one of those, was hooked. I kept coming back to look at the pretty shoes and to hear your incredible knowledge on all things science career, and for little Isis says science, and ass shaking jams, and for the occasional post en Espanol which I attempt to read. You are all around great Goddess. I think I may appreciate the most the introspective posts about your own career and life as a mother, they are beautiful and it is very helpful at this stage in my life to have big kid scientists act like human beings, and pretty cool human beings at that. Oh man how I ramble, sorry Dr. Isis that this is so long, hopefully reading it didn't exhaust you too much, not that you could ever be overwhelmed by anything seeing as how you are a goddess and all, I look forward to hearing your thoughts if you have the time. Thank you for being awesome!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;First, you&amp;#39;re welcome for the awesomeness.  I would like to be able to say that it is a conscious choice, but I really can&amp;#39;t help but be amazing.  And humble. I am really, really humble.
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;Now, boy, oh boy, oh boy. Where do we begin with this one?  I think it is a mark of character to realize the breadth of what you don&amp;#39;t know.  The question is, how do we deal with it? Let me start by showing you a graphic representation of all the science-y stuff I know and don&amp;#39;t know...

Yes, that too. Some groups of spiders - trapdoor and wolf spiders - dig tunnels that they use to ambush passing insects. But these tunnels can also provide shelter and accommodation for other animals, including one of the rarest of Australia's lizards - the &lt;a href="http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/biodiversity/bcp/pdfs/pygmy_bluetongue_info_sheet.pdf"&gt;pygmy blue-tongue lizard&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that the lizard's survival depends entirely on the spiders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/upload/2009/07/spiders_construct_homes_for_endangered_pygmy_lizards/Pygmy_bluetongue.jpg" width="200" height="186" alt="Pygmy_bluetongue.jpg"&gt;The pygmy blue-tongue is a native of South Australia. It's so rare that zoologists thought it extinct for over 30 years and it re-emerged in the public eye in the most unlikely way. In 1992, a dead specimen of this supposedly extinct animal was found in the stomach of a brown snake, found dead on the side of a road. That unexpected discovery prompted intensive surveys of the surrounding area, which found several lizards living in spider burrows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the spiders, the lizards use the burrows for ambush but they also act as nurseries, cooling stations and defensive forts. To understand the relationship between lizards and spiders, &lt;a href="http://www.scieng.flinders.edu.au/biology/people/academic/bull_m/index.html"&gt;Michael Bull&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;from Adelaide's Flinders University studied the fates of both species in a single hectare of South Australian land. Over two years, his team spent bursts of two weeks, intensively searching the plot of land for signs of burrows. Each one was probed with a fibre optic camera to see who lay inside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have found that lizards readily accept artificial burrows and adding these to the local area will halt the decline of the lizard populations. That's all very good, but as Bull writes, "a sustainable supply of natural burrows would be a better option in the longer term".

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5938/325"&gt;“Tiger Moth Jams Bat Sonar”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the punchiest title of a scientific paper I’ve seen in years: not a word longer than five letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tiger moth (&lt;em&gt;Bertholdia trigona&lt;/em&gt;) makes a clicking sound when it’s being chased by bats.  There are three possible reasons for this.  First, it could be an “aposematic” call, warning the bats that the moth is distasteful, so that they’ll avoid it after one or more noxious encounters (this would be the equivalent of a rattlesnake’s rattle, or the bright warning coloration of the distasteful ladybug).  This doesn’t seem likely because tiger moths seem to be palatable to bats. Second, the clicks could startle a naive bat and cause it to miss.  Finally, the click could be a “jamming” call, messing up the bat’s sonar so that it can’t locate the moth.  These three hypotheses (which of course are not mutually exclusive) make different predictions about how a bat will behave upon initial and subsequent encounters with a moth. Under the “startle” hypothesis, for example, bats should initially miss the moths but then start catching them as they grow accustomed to the clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors  evaluated these hypotheses by presenting tiger moths to naive big brown bats (&lt;em&gt;Eptesicus fuscus&lt;/em&gt;). They found that the bat’s behavior best conforms to #3: bats can’t seem to find the moths from the very outset. And the sonic profile of the moth calls is also that expected if they have a “jamming” function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bats evolved sonar; tiger moths evolved a jamming call. This is an example of an “arms race”: the perpetual evolution and co-evolution of predators and prey.  According to Richard Dawkins and others, such arms races were a major evolutionary cause of increased biological complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5938/314"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lizard swims through sand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/science/21obsand.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;reported in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The desert-dwelling sandfish lizard (&lt;em&gt;Scincus scincus&lt;/em&gt;, found in Africa and the Middle East) not only walks on the sand, but swims through it at speeds of up to 6 inches per second. The ability to dive into the sand and “swim” is useful for escaping the desert heat and evading predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using X-ray cinematography, scientists found that, when swimming undersand, the sandfish retracts its limbs, pressing them against its body, and undulates like an eel, “swimming” through the sand.  This is an efficient way of moving because sand has both liquid- and solid-like properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the “Supplementary material,” three movies of the sandfish:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol325/issue5938/images/data/314/DC1/1172490s2.mov"&gt;Swimming in the sand &lt;/a&gt;(an X-ray video, really cool)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol325/issue5938/images/data/314/DC1/1172490s3.mov"&gt;Swimming in the sand with opaque markers on the body&lt;/a&gt; (shows that its limbs are pressed against the body during the undulatory swimming). The “I-L distance” is the inter-limb distance measured between markers on the limbs; it’s an index of whether the legs are splayed or appressed to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay, time to fix that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've offered my opinion in the comments on various blogs, so I'll just resummarize it here -- this time with pictures!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the issue itself, I fall in the so-called "New Atheist" camp, in the sense that I do not think religion and science are compatible&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and I don't think there is some sort of social responsibility and/or critical pragmatic imperative that ought to prevent me from saying so.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/15/what-questions-can-science-answer/"&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt; have expounded on this position at great lengths, so I won't bother to rehash any of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the more unique take I have on it is that I think that, strategically, it is important that we have &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; "New Atheists" and accomodationists -- and maybe even desirable that the accomodationists distance themselves from us, though certainly not as loudly or as shrilly as Mooneybaum feel compelled to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Modern atheists often draw an analogy to the gay rights movement, and while we certainly do not face the level of discrimination that gay people did and still do (the state of NY has never barred Atheist Marriage, AFAIK...), I think there are a number of areas where the analogy is apt.  Certainly the &lt;a href="http://outcampaign.org/"&gt;Out Campaign&lt;/a&gt; is an idea I support, as you can see a few hundred pixels to your right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;This is Dawkins and PZ...&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lolsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gay-pride-float-men.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:230px" src="http://www.lolsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/gay-pride-float-men.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Another place where I think the analogy is apt is the answer to the question, What kind of people are necessary to enact social change?  Riddle me this: In the case of the gay rights movement, which archetype is more responsible for the progress over the past decades?  Is it the guy marching in the Pride parade wearing almost nothing except a few bits of leather, at all times being unashamedly himself?  Or is it the nice quiet lesbian couple that lives next door, where your mom didn't even realize they were gay until you pointed it out to her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table width="200" style="float:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:200px"&gt;...and this is Mooney and Kirshenbaum.  Dunno who the kid is...&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01385/lesbian_mothers_ba_1385794c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:110px" src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01385/lesbian_mothers_ba_1385794c.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Answer:  &lt;i&gt;Both&lt;/i&gt;.  Social change is not possible without "loud and proud" elements -- whether they be gay or atheist -- to push the boundaries of what is acceptable.  To coin a phrase, "We're here, we're godless, get used to it."  At the same time social change is not possible without people who are so moderate that the other side can't even really find anything about them to criticize.  The same way your conservative mother might say, "Patty and Selma are &lt;i&gt;gay&lt;/i&gt;?  But they act so normal!  Huh, I guess it's not true that all gay people are evil," we should hope that a young fundie might say, "Chris Mooney is an atheist?  But he is so holier-than-thou!"  Oh wait, that didn't come out right, but you get my point...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, even though I disagree with the NCSE's position on accomodationism, I am secretly glad that they do it.  It probably &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; strategically desirable, but &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; if at the same time you have us vocal atheists saying, "Uh, no that's not quite right."  If the accomodationist position were the only active one, it would be a strategic dud, because the other side would always be paddling harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the accomodationists and the "New Atheists" actually compliment each other quite well.  As entertaining as this little blogowar is (and now you can buy the book!  When is the movie coming out, Mooney?), I really hope it just kinda quietly goes away.  It doesn't do anybody any favors.  Well, except me, because I indirectly managed to get a lot of blog hits from it, but I don't think that was Mooney's or Coyne's original intention...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;That is, I think religion as most people understand it is logically contradictory to science -- not that a reasonable person couldn't believe both... I think I'm a reasonable person, and I believe a number of irrational things, e.g. that my wife and I were meant to be together, that my son is the smartest four-month-old on the planet, that anybody will still be interested in my blog after next week...  The differences are 1) I know these beliefs are irrational, 2) I don't try to convince anybody else of my own personal irrationalities, and 3) I don't pretend they are compatible with a scientific worldview, so that if it eventually becomes undesirable or dangerous to continue to hold these irrational beliefs I will have no trouble discarding them.  In fact, if theists would apply those three criteria to their beliefs, I don't think there'd be much of a role for the so-called "New Atheists", because what would we have to complain about?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-4686417444311703637?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247936907839"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13915">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/029f99d08658438c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">The Virgin Mary’s Full of Crap.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kwtx.com/offbeatnews/headlines/50946582.html"&gt;In bird shit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/VirginCrap.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/VirginCrap.jpg" alt="VirginCrap" title="VirginCrap" width="200" height="120"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy crap.  (Literally?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even a joke.  They’re taking it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cristal Pachuca said she took pictures and began making calls to invite others to see, what &lt;strong&gt;she describes as, a miracle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;We just all feel protected&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a blessing to our family and to everybody that comes to see it,” says Cristal Pachuca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Sunday, &lt;strong&gt;a steady stream of family, friends, neighbors and strangers has stopped by to pray&lt;/strong&gt; and take pictures of the image.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Christian people: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really?  REALLY?!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who among you is going to inform Cristal and her family that they’re all being crazy?  That they’re staring at shit?  That they should just wash their truck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*sigh*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gotta love this ironic comment on the KWTX site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s things like this that make Christians look stupid. &lt;strong&gt;Christianity is about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ which causes you to love and serve others. It’s not about superstitious nonsense.&lt;/strong&gt; When you are seeing images in bird poop, you’ve lost perspective a long time ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says the person who believes Jesus was born of a virgin…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this story (and others like it) ridiculous is not the wacky family that prays to a piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s ridiculous is that only a handful of Christians will ever come out and say this family is crazy.  Others may laugh at the story, but they won’t say the family is wrong.  They let them off the hook in the name of faith.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you wonder why people like me don’t take your beliefs seriously.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, for instance, I was treated to a hard-hitting &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2009484881_gwen17.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Gwen Stefani.  A discussion of &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2009490520_askcarley18.html"&gt;wedding insurance&lt;/a&gt;.  And a reminder that tonight is the 1388th anniversary of &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2009492255_junejo18m.html"&gt;Mohammed’s famous all-night roadtrip from Mecca to Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isra and Miraj is such a miraculous story. The trip was witnessed by no one and consequently required the faithful of the time to believe in the unseen. Believing the story of Isra and Miraj today still requires an act of faith — faith that is paramount in Islam because it recognizes God’s ability to make possible the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m sure that Jerusalem is an exciting place to visit.  There’s always a chance that you’ll get &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/06/2617502.htm?section=world"&gt;spit on&lt;/a&gt; by Orthodox Jews.  You might end up in the middle of a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8156239.stm"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; between child-abusers and CPS.  Even &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106748479"&gt;parking your car&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes a grand adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, if we’re going devote scarce newspaper space (and take time out of our busy schedules) to celebrate something “impossible” that also wasn’t observed by anyone, can’t we come up with something a little more imaginative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, how about celebrating the time that I almost stole Melrose Place’s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Andrews"&gt;Sydney Andrews&lt;/a&gt; away from the evil Dr. Michael Mancini?  Or the time that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_in_Charge"&gt;Charles and Buddy&lt;/a&gt; ruined my date with &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/anilduman/jamie/jamie.htm"&gt;Jamie Powell&lt;/a&gt;?  Or the time that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb5DkLd22Ic"&gt;Fergie sang me a Lionel Richie song while I was dressed as a clown&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you’re just the sort of faithless jerk who’d rather deny god’s ability to “make possible the impossible.”  Who doesn’t believe in “god’s infinite power.”  And who doesn’t find fairy tales “spiritually gratifying.”  &lt;/p&gt;

Their decision will have major implications in terms of which drugs are available through the German public healthcare system. However, they &lt;a href="http://www.iqwig.de/download/A05-20C_Executive_summary_Bupropion_mirtazapine_and_reboxetine_in_the_treatment_of_depression.pdf"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to suspend judgement on reboxetine because the manufacturers, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/span&gt;, did not provide them with the results of all available trials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ten relevant trials for reboxetine that could definitely be included were identified from the literature search in bibliographic databases, publicly accessible drug approval documents, and clinical trial registries. However, 3 of these trials could not be analysed with regard to the antidepressive effect of reboxetine because the publications only contained data on partial populations ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, 6 potentially relevant trials were identified that could not be &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;included because no full publication existed and the manufacturer of reboxetine (Pfizer) refused to provide full information on all trials with reboxetine...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[and] Due to insufficient cooperation from the manufacturer of reboxetine, it remained unclear whether additional unpublished trials exist. It may well be that the identified data represent an even smaller portion of available evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;IQWiG have pulled no punches. It's not every day that a healthcare agency puts out a &lt;a href="http://www.iqwig.de/index.868.en.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; headlined &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"Pfizer conceals study data: Drug manufacturer hinders the best possible treatment of patients with depression". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;nd to be fair to Pfizer, they are hardly behaving worse than their rivals. Essex pharmaceuticals, the manufacturers of mirtazapine, also failed to provide all the data on their drug. GlaxoSmithKline, who make buproprion, did in fact play ball in this case, but this is the very same company who have been &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/6291773.stm"&gt;widely accused of suppressing&lt;/a&gt; data on Seroxat-induced suicides in kids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the problem is not unique to Pfizer, or to reboxetine. The problem is with the system which allows drug manufacturers to conduct as many trials as they like and only publish the results they want. The resulting &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"&gt;publication bias&lt;/a&gt; is damaging to every field of medicine. One solution is for scientific journals to &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMe048225"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;only publish trials that were pre-registered before they started&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so that everyone knows about trials before they happen. But maybe this isn't enough. The IQWiG note that the US has &lt;a href="http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/fdaaa.html"&gt;a law&lt;/a&gt; mandating that clinical trial results must be registered and reported to the FDA, and call for the EU to adopt similar legislation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=BMJ&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1136%2Fbmj.b2521&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=German+agency+refuses+to+rule+on+drug%27s+benefits+until+Pfizer+discloses+all+trial+results&amp;amp;rft.issn=0959-8138&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=338&amp;amp;rft.issue=jun22+1&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmj.com%2Fcgi%2Fdoi%2F10.1136%2Fbmj.b2521&amp;amp;rft.au=Stafford%2C+N.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Clinical+Research%2CPsychology%2CResearch+%2F+Scholarship%2CNeuroscience"&gt;Stafford, N.

Combined with the earlier structure of rhodopsin, this provided a template for structure-based design for GPCRs. However, there was a lurking mystery in the structure, a mystery which was not always discussed but which has started to come to light recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Th mystery is exemplified by a recent paper in which authors from D E Shaw Research in New York use extremely long molecular dynamics simulations to uncover a peculiar conformational characteristic of the ß2 AR. The original structure was crystallized bound to an inverse agonist named carazolol. The receptor as crystallized was thought to be in an inactive state. In this state, two helices of the receptor were at some distance from each other. However, this observation did not square with biochemical experiments that indicated proximity of the two helices mediated by a crucial ionic lock, a salt bridge between a glutamate and arginine. This lock however was absent in the crystal structure, raising questions about the exact role of the lock in activating the receptor and the nature of the inactive state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the present study, the authors used extremely long, microsecond MD simulations on the crystal structure. They used the DESMOND program recently introduced by Schrodinger and D E Shaw to perform simulations of the GPCR in a lipid bilayer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All they really had to do was wait. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first 150 ns were not very interesting from the perspective of the salt bridge. However, the salt bridge spontaneously formed after 150 ns and then stayed put like a fly on fly paper. Notice the N-O distance (blue) and how it stabilizes after 150 ns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://img38.imageshack.us/i/picture2lpp.png/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4550/picture2lpp.png" border="0" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bridge also involved local movement of the helices and some important residues. The authors also did the simulation in the presence and absence of the ligand and found that this lock forms irrespective of the presence of the ligand. They follow up with some mutagenesis experiments that reconcile the conformational changes with experimental observations. Interestingly, they mutate an aspartate that is also proximal to the arginine in the salt bridge. Mutation of this aspartate would be expected to "free up" the arginine and further encourage its interaction with the glutamate. However, the opposite seemed to happen, indicating an interesting role for the aspartate as a something of lock itself in holding the aspartate fixed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The overall conclusion is that there are probably two inactive states, one in which the salt bridge is formed (the dominant one) and one in which it's broken (not high populated) and the receptor recycles between the two. This kind of observation is clearly important for further structure-based design since it implies that one could encourage GPCR activation if the "right" conformation of the receptor could be preferentially stabilized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing to note here is the time. Nothing interesting would have been observed had the simulation been run for less than 150 ns. Researchers who ran the simulation for less than 150 ns may not have had something worth reporting. 150 ns is a reasonably long amount of time for any MD program or simulation. The fact that such simulations can be run for microseconds attests to the rapid development of hardware and software exemplified by D E Shaw's program DESMOND and their processor named ANTON.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes simply waiting long enough can lead to productive results.

They put together a &lt;a href="http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=09-P13-00029&amp;amp;segmentID=7"&gt;really fun segment&lt;/a&gt; in which I not only explain the book’s arguments to host Jeff Young, but also provide running commentary on one of the best examples I’ve seen of using the new media to communicate positively and entertainingly about science–&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50ZssEojtM"&gt;CERN’s “Large Hadron Rap” video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can listen to the whole “Living on Earth” segment &lt;a href="http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=09-P13-00029&amp;amp;segmentID=7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;YOUNG: Well give me some examples of challenges we face where the average Joe needs to know something about science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOONEY: Well there are certainly many and I think by far the largest right now is the climate change issue. That’s the one where the most is at stake for the future, and it’s also the one where you see such a huge gap between the average American in terms of what they think the state of scientific understanding is and then the scientific community on the other hand. The scientists are something like 85 percent sure that it’s human caused. And the public is more like, you know, 50 percent sure. And if you break it out by party affiliation, and this has been done many times, the Republicans overwhelmingly don’t accept the science. So you got a politicized issue and you’ve got a huge gap between scientists and the public. You add that to unfortunately a lot of bad media coverage of the issue over time and you pretty much get the gridlock that we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOUNG: Something you point out here I found pretty interesting and that is among those Republicans who do not think that climate change is caused by humans, it doesn’t seem to matter how educated they are. Even well educated Republicans hold that belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOONEY: Yeah, it’s really amazing, isn’t it? This is a different Pew study. They studied global warming opinions and they looked at party affiliation and level of education. And what they found for Republicans is that the higher the level of education, the less likely they are to accept scientific reality. And for Democrats and Independents it’s precisely the opposite. I don’t find that actually surprising having been involved with debating the climate debate for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You look at someone who doesn’t accept the science of global warming, like George Will the Washington Post Columnist or Michael Criton the late novelist, someone like that, these people are not stupid, you know, they’re actually quite intelligent, and their intelligence itself is what lets them come up with arguments against the scientific position of the scientific community that are quite ingenious and very misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the full “Living on Earth” segment is &lt;a href="http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.htm?programID=09-P13-00029&amp;amp;segmentID=7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247929716182"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1635830665840234488">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25542ed96d1663b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Sometimes Violence Is Excusable</title><published>2009-07-18T14:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T14:54:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/sometimes-violence-is-excusable.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1635830665840234488/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1635830665840234488" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Here&amp;#39;s Buzz Aldrin reacting to being called a coward and a liar.

Pareidolia, for those not familiar with the term, is a phenomenon where humans see patterns in various things, you know, like seeing Elvis in a flame or the Virgin Mary on a &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/04/virgin-mary-appears.html"&gt;stain under a freeway overpass&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago or in a &lt;a href="http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/v05/rnd05_40.shtml"&gt;window blotch in Perth Amboy&lt;/a&gt;, or seeing Jesus on a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4172689.stm"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;, on the wall of a &lt;a href="http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:CnvGX-0G9rwJ:www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp%3FARTICLE_ID%3D44986+jesus+on+toast&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=9&amp;amp;client=safari"&gt;shower&lt;/a&gt;, on a &lt;a href="http://www.googlesightseeing.com/?p=399"&gt;sand dune&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_1423248.html"&gt;potato chip&lt;/a&gt;,  or (my personal favorite) a &lt;a href="http://www.wtol.com/Global/story.asp?S=3703786"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pierogi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, there have even been Jesus sightings on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/all_hail_the_jesus_cat.php"&gt;a cat&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/still_more_weekend_pareidolia_lookin_for.php"&gt;stain on a ceiling tile&lt;/a&gt;, and even on a rather &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/the_best_jesus_pareidolia_yet.php"&gt;odd location on a dog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I really, really have to question why any believer would advertise having seen the Virgin Mary in &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=8112209"&gt;this particular stain&lt;/a&gt;, much less make a pilgrimage to see it and marvel at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I liked seeing the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/best_pareidolia_ever.php"&gt;Virgin Mary apparition in a Lava Lamp better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/looking_for_the_virgin_mary_in_all_the_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/DIG9U-Y6x8A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247929270887"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/so_what_is_lunacy_compatible_w.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5ba8f188771c4b4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">So, what is lunacy compatible with?

You know the sort of thing I&amp;#39;m talking about: &amp;quot;Let there be light&amp;quot; is a perfect description of the big bang, by &amp;quot;grass&amp;quot; god really meant &amp;quot;cyanobacteria&amp;quot;, the appearance of lights in the sky refers to the evolution of animal vision, etc., etc., etc., yadda yadda yadda. It&amp;#39;s ridiculous, of course, mere &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; retrofitting of valid interpretations to a pile of bronze age bogosity. This is what happens when scientists try to combine old superstitions with real science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know of Parker from another connection, too: he's the author of the Light-Switch Hypothesis, described in his book, &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/on-the-first-day-god-said---"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Blink of an Eye&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That was the idea that the trigger for the Cambrian explosion was the evolution of vision, which I'd thought might have been an interesting component, but was burdened with far too heavy a load of speculation and a suspicious reliance on single causes. This does explain some of the pseudo-biblical rhapsodies in that book, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/so_what_is_lunacy_compatible_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tzAbHcmZZOI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247927657815"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8308">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81fa93c1a1bf8151</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">“You have such Prady eyes…”</title><published>2009-07-18T14:00:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T14:00:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8308" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an individual perennially engaged in thinking and analyzing the hows, whys, whats, etc. of gender issues and how they impact this skeptical movement that I find myself a part of, you can bet I have some things to say about The Amaz!ng Meeting 7 in this regard.  My experiences over the past few weeks, organizing and pulling off Skepchickcon, and then attending TAM7, have brought these issues to the front of my mind once again, and I’d like to share my thoughts and ask you for yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I’ll start with the big question that always seems to come up:  Why aren’t there more women involved in science and skepticism?  Typical answers tend to point to differences between women and men:  women don’t like/aren’t good at hard sciences, women eschew conflict, etc.  I couldn’t disagree more.  Over the past few months, I’ve come to believe strongly that the reasons are almost entirely related to subtle sexism (on the part of both men and women within the movement) and social networking (which I will address in a future post); both problems which I’d like to think are on their way to being solved, but we clearly still have work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about sexism.  I’ll start with an example from TAM7.  It seems to me that a lot of men in the skeptical movement, well intentioned as they may be, have a tendency to look at women as though we are some sort of separate species; monolithic and mysterious, and that there is some sort of code they need to learn but can never seem to work out which will magically get them laid and make all women love them.  This was evident in Bill Prady’s keynote address, both in the video clips from his show, The Big Bang Theory, and in his tragic dating advice for the guys in the room.  &lt;a href="http://icbseverywhere.com/blog/2009/07/17/my-perfect-conference-and-what-it/"&gt;Barbara Drescher&lt;/a&gt; does a good job dissecting the shows weaknesses in this regard, and also includes video of the most offensive bit of Prady’s speech.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think Drescher is spot on with this commentary, she also does something which, in my opinion, contributes to the unwelcoming atmosphere for women.  Well, at least certain types of women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I was taken aback by some of the women in the audience. I can hardly be called a prude, but some of the outfits in that room were far beyond what is appropriate attire for any kind of conference. What’s more, they were very poor, naive attempts at sexual expression that left me wonder just what kind of delusion-producing mirror they were looking into each morning and where I could get one. Just as an example, one woman (I would guess her age at about 20yo) wore a dressy black blouse with extremely tight cut-off denim short-shorts, thigh-high fishnet stockings, and 2-inch patent leather strappy spike heals which were at least 2 sizes too small. No kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly find it difficult to know where to begin here.  You want more women in skepticism, but when they show up without properly camouflaging their sexuality you call them out on your blog?  To me, this is all part and parcel of the same problem I touched on above of women (or at least attractive women) being seen as separate from (read: intellectually inferior to) men.  Why is it that no one is blogging about the wide range of attire among the men at TAM7?  I didn’t realize there was a dress code.  Maybe we should all wear uniforms next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that we belong to a diverse movement, made up of people who are by definition outsiders.  Most of us have left our received traditions behind and struck out on our own in search of a more rational path.  We are used to being seen as loud and obnoxious weirdos, and many of us revel in this fact.  So yes, some of us dress a bit outrageously compared to what you might be used to.  Part of the reason we come to events like TAM is to be with people who think like us; who accept us as we are, and this acceptance should include how we choose to express ourselves stylistically.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the larger societal problem at hand – the sexy/smart dichotomy – is not for all of us women to unsex ourselves.  As women, we need to move away from the idea that there is only one acceptable way to be taken seriously as a woman in a historically male dominated arena.  This may serve us in the short term, but in the long term it limits who we can allow ourselves and others to be, publicly, and it undermines any chance of ever being taken seriously as whole people.  The solution as I see it lies in all of us just being ourselves, fully, and allowing each other the space to do that as well, without judgement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchickcon was a beautiful example of this idea at work.  We had 9 panel discussions, running the gamut of skeptical topics, which were very well attended (by crowds approaching 50/50, I might add) and peopled mostly by women.  We had productive discussions and debates, and many of the same folks who engaged in great discussion with us at our panels partied with us at night.  I’m very proud of what we accomplished there, and hope to build on it for next year.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take time for some in the movement to catch on to this idea, but I think, ultimately, it’s the only way we will ever get to the equality we seek for our community.  &lt;/p&gt;

Myers has some thoughts on "&lt;a href="http://dgmyers.blogspot.com/2009/07/self-reference-and-narcissism.html"&gt;Self-reference and narcissicism&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Person reflects genre. Despite the fact that he is an eighteenth-century author like Sterne and Chesterfield, Franklin uses the first person more often because he is writing an autobiography, a literary kind that, except when it is an exercise in voluble self-concealment, like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The Education of Henry Adams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;, depends helplessly upon the first person. Similarly, to accuse David Copperfield of “ego-involvement”—he uses some form of the first person 6.3% of the time—does not seem quite right. David is as much a “camera” as Christopher in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The Berlin Stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;; he is at least as interested in the people in his life as in himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Myers quotes David Cooperfield's first encounter with Uriah Heep, and notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;David refers to himself eleven times in this passage—exactly five percent of the words are first-person forms—while referring to Heep just seven times (ten, if the references to Heep’s eyes almost as impersonal objects are included). Yet his entire attention is on Heep, not himself. The narrative strategy is to register Heep’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;, because that is how—at least for Dickens—a man is to be judged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another possibility as well. One of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1574#comment-36409"&gt;Jamie Pennebaker's generalizations&lt;/a&gt; about the social-psychology literature on pronoun usage is that in conversation, "Usually, the higher status speaker will use fewer 'I' words." This is not, I suppose, because the lower-status speaker is registering the other's effect out loud.  But perhaps in such situations, the higher-status person can afford to focus on the content of the discussion, while someone in a socially inferior role needs to worry more about the  relationship and how they should or can fit into it. And this might be true even even of their interior conversation with themselves, as in the Dickens passage that Myers analyzes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about these questions requires counting how pronouns are used, not just how many of which are where.  For a classic non-pronominal example  where looking at function leads to a different conclusion from simply looking at form, see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000873.html"&gt;Gender and tags&lt;/a&gt;", 5/9/2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myers continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Unless first-person genres and their self-referential purposes are taken into account, complaints like Fish’s and Noonan’s about “self-reverence” and the “imperial possession” are empty moralizing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, don't repeat this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, when I was a mere graduate student, a fellow student working in an unnamed country in Africa discovered a very very old stone artifact.  To this day, this bit of chipped stone debris, representing the activities of an ancient very pre-human hominid, is one of the oldest well dated, in situ objects of its kind known.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stone had some yeck on it, and for giggles, this stone got passed on to a physicist who had invented   a new way of looking at small things.  He was going to look at the tool to see what the yeck was.  I should point out that this physicist had no knowledge to speak of of either archaeology or geology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away results came back clearly indicating that the yeck was made of apatite.  Apatite is, of course, the primary mineral constituent of bone.  Was this a piece of ancient bone jammed into the micro-bumpy surface of an ancient stone tool?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_seductive_siren_of_soft_ti_2.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_seductive_siren_of_soft_ti_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/r00qBRxh4tA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247922082318"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/best_virgin_mary_sighting_yet.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/18a44a4888c236f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Best Virgin Mary sighting yet</title><published>2009-07-18T13:33:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T13:33:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jV9kduBwHY0/best_virgin_mary_sighting_yet.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/best_virgin_mary_sighting_yet.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh, I believe! &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=8112209"&gt;What else could this be?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Finally, the cat of a friend, Mr. Nesbitt.  Mr. Nesbitt, a 14-year-old moggy, has not been well, but may be on the mend. He looks pretty low in this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;As a rescue cat in the UK, he was given his name by the vet.  (”Mr. Nesbitt,” of course, sounds unusual because it’s a proper human name, and for some reason we usually don’t give usually give our pets human names like Fred, Sally, or Paul.)&lt;/p&gt;

Since February, I’ve been working harder at my day job than I ever have, I endured some personal tragedies and dealt with the attendant grief, I once again helped out at Houston’s Fourth of July festival, and just last week, I stood up as one of my best buds got married, while at the same time another one of my buds was getting married in Las Vegas. Lately, I’ve barely had time to stop and smell the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things seem to be settling down for me a bit, which means I have more time to do the things I’ve had to put on the back burner, like reading, sleeping, playing volleyball, catching a wave or two, and playing with you all on &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt;. Why, I even had a chance to catch a baseball game the other day, and I found something to share with you all. Read about it after the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not a huge baseball fan, and I’d rather have my lips removed than watch it on TV, but there’s something supremely enjoyable about sitting in the sunshine, cutting up with your friends, noshing on a hot dog, and sipping on a cold beer. That’s why I go to the games. I usually don’t even remember the score or which team won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the game the other day, I noticed some of the players wearing what appeared to be small hula hoops around their necks. I was curious, because I often wear a little earthy bling myself. But my bling usually comes in the form of a leather choker with a small pendant attached, or something else similarly understated. These ball players had freaking equipment from the carnival Ring Toss game around their necks.&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/baseball-necklace3-300x206.jpg" alt="baseball-necklace" width="300" height="206"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked the avid baseball fan in our group what was going on with the unusual necklaces, and he told me they were something called &lt;a href="http://www.phitenusa.com/default.aspx"&gt;Phiten&lt;/a&gt; necklaces. He said a lot of ball players wear them because they supposedly regulate the body’s energy flow, reducing fatigue and thereby maximizing performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as you can imagine, my bullshit detector started squawking like a penguin being murdered, and when I got home, I Googled like a sumbitch. Terms like “energy flow” are prominent in New Age vernacular, and I just knew I was going to discover the necklaces are made to align chakras and center ch’is, and that they smell like Chinese rain when you burn them. And I wasn’t too far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.phitenusa.com/t-technology.aspx"&gt;Phiten website&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phiten products work with your body’s energy system, helping to regulate and balance the flow of energy throughout your body. Proper energy balance helps to alleviate discomfort, speed recovery, and counteract fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all well and good, right? But how does it do all that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, according to the website, the manufacturers have applied something called the &lt;em&gt;Phild Process &lt;/em&gt;to create the Phiten technology that is present in the necklaces, wristbands, power sleeves, and bracelets they sell. Now, I could find no other mention of the Phild Process in relation to anything other than the Phiten product line, but apparently, the process involves dissolving titanium in water, which can then be added to the materials used to make the Phiten accessories. Says the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In nature, titanium is not a soluble material. However, by utilizing the high-intensity Phild Process, Phiten scientists are able to dissolve titanium in water. This creates Aqua-Titanium, which then can be absorbed into material just like a dye. The Aqua-Titanium becomes part of the fabric and can not be washed out or fade away. Aqua-Titanium most prominently used in our necklaces and apparel, where the entire fabric is permeated with Aqua-Titanium and emits energy that effectively controls your bio-electric current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Phiten scientists dissolve titanium in water, which is absorbed into material made into necklaces and other apparel that then &lt;em&gt;emit energy&lt;/em&gt;  and have the power to regulate the body’s bio-electric current ”by stabilizing ions”. This apparently permits a greater flow of energy with less waste. Fatigue sets in later and recovery time is shortened. And all of this magic happens by wearing some of their jewelry on the outside of the body in the neck, arm, or wrist areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t say why it works in the neck, arm, or wrist areas. Or if it will work if you wore the noose around your waist or if you stuffed it up your ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps, just perhaps, it doesn’t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um . . . Yeah, it’s a load of crap, and I’m going to go with “it doesn’t work at all”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I found out that this particular sports voodoo isn’t new. There are mentions on the Internet of Major League ball players wearing Phiten gear as early as the 2008 season and possibly even in 2007. And it looks as though some athletes elsewhere are on the bandwagon as well.&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/korean-baseball-necklaces-300x125.png" alt="korean-baseball-necklaces" width="300" height="125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ball game I attended recently was the first time I had seen it. And my curiosity led me to discover the nonsense Phiten is selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, professional athletes these days have no problem paying the $20-$80 for the accessories (if they are paying for them at all), but this bit of bunkum could cost the average Joe some hard-earned cash for an ugly horse collar that does absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, unless you’re just enamored of hideous jewelry, steer clear of the Phiten stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s flattering to read the accolades, and get an autographed copy of WEIT (I already have a non-autographed copy) but I think the honorable thing for me to do is to pass the honor to the person who should be (IMO) the rightful winner: “Your Name’s Not Bruce?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He listed 5 entries in his original post, with “Faiththeist” as his first, and then later went with his 4th and 5th entries when he discovered the rules limited you to two entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(subsequently others noted that the double “th” was redundant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I merely recognized (as did many others) that it was a very good choice and was fortunate to be able to claimed it when he apparently abandoned it.  But I didn’t “coyne” the word, and I’ll note that at least one other independently proposed it after “Your Name’s Not Bruce?” posted his (and so would arguably have a better claim if “Your Name’s Not Bruce?” has to be eliminated on this technicality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, “Your Name’s Not Bruce?” really deserves the win (IMO) because he did the creative act (not me).  But if he doesn’t show up to claim it and you still need to unload the signed copy of WEIT, I know of any number of good high schools in my state (including a few in Cobb Co, GA) that I would prefer to be the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The diversity of circadian properties is understood to be a higher-level property of interacting multicellular and multi-organ circadian systems: how the clocks receive environmental information, how the multiple pacemakers communicate and synchronize with each other, how they convey the temporal information to the peripheral clocks in all the other cells in the body, and how peripheral clocks generate observable rhythms in biochemistry, physiology and behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/quail_how_many_clocks_2.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/quail_how_many_clocks_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/fAYOGoAv88U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247916635603"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13929">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5bcdc750fe2d1dde</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist/Christian Cooperation"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Who’s More Effective at De-Converting Christians?</title><published>2009-07-18T11:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T11:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/18/whos-more-effective-at-de-converting-christians/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a fantastic interview with &lt;strong&gt;Zach Weiner&lt;/strong&gt;, the man behind &lt;a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/"&gt;Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href="http://freethinker.co.uk/2009/07/18/saturday-morning-breakfast-cereal-an-interview-with-zach-weiner/"&gt;The Freethinker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20070514.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the exchange that stood out to me the most:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;FT:&lt;/strong&gt; There has recently been a change of tone in the discourse surrounding religion, with the so-called New Atheists arriving on the scene and causing a stir. One of these is PZ Myers of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, who has featured your cartoons on a number of occasions. What do you think about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZW:&lt;/strong&gt; I enjoy watching debates featuring the so-called New Atheists, but I’m not convinced that they’re terribly productive. I prefer the work done by people like Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and E.O. Wilson. It’s probably just personal preference, but &lt;strong&gt;I feel like passive approaches are often more effective when trying to reach out to people and change their beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;. Bill Cosby once said (when critiqued for not dealing with race explicitly in his comedy) that he thought he could help fight racism by getting people to enjoy his comedy albums before they realized he was black. That is, a person who might be anti-black might hear his comedy, like it, later find out they were of different races, and then be moved to reconsider his viewpoint. I think a similar thing might be said about Carl Sagan. You read his books, see his shows, become convinced that he is smart and thoughtful, then find out he’s an Atheist; maybe then you start thinking, “well, these non-believers may have a point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Although I probably agree with a lot of the views held by the New Atheists, I find their approach too scathing, and often more about being personally right than about getting people involved in the use of science and logic as ways of viewing the universe. &lt;strong&gt;If you are a strong atheist and wish to shape the world to your view, your time would be much better spent teaching an after-school program about logic than going to atheist club meetings and posting about how stupid fundamentalists are.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Atheists tend to preach to the choir.  In the process, maybe several people on the fence falls over to our side.  It could also be argued that people like &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/strong&gt; have created stronger Christians than more atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, no doubt those atheists are invaluable in rallying the troops.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need more of, though, are people who can &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; with religious people and get them to listen to what we have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s more likely to convert atheists to Christianity: &lt;strong&gt;Rick Warren&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Warren may have a bigger reach — by a huge margin — but I don’t think he connects with atheists.  To me, Collins is the obvious answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s more likely to create new atheists: &lt;strong&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Tyson doesn’t even use the word to describe himself, I’d say he’s far more likely to do it, for exactly the reasons Zach mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean it’s bad to rally the troops, or poke fun at religion, or cease pointing out how ridiculous religious beliefs are.  It takes all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ones who have the ability to get the other side to listen are rare.  We’d be far more effective with more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, I think the type of response Zach gave is what &lt;strong&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum&lt;/strong&gt; intended to do with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/16/the-debate-over-unscientific-america/"&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;… but instead, they’ve just pissed off the atheists.  If the book is a success, it’ll only be because it has a &lt;em&gt;chance&lt;/em&gt; to reach a Christian audience.  But it’s too early to tell whether they’ll embrace it.)&lt;br&gt;

You have set my single day visitor record by a factor of thirty-five, which I expect I won’t be besting for quite some time. I hope some of you stick around, this is a very new blog and I’m still not entirely sure where it’s going but I will try to keep improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I want to reveal my complete ineptitude at marketing by telling you that I am at Disneyland this weekend and so probably won’t be posting (I’m doing this on my iPhone which isn’t terribly fun). If you check back in on Tuesday though I promise I’ll have something for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_charity_ch/1-04%2520Lochs%2520Of%2520Dread.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a great idea hit me.  You see, all over my town, small, local, community-based non-profit organizations (such as museums, libraries, hospitals, parks, etc.) are facing huge shortages, both financially and in terms of workers.  I give a little bit of money to charity, and I volunteer a couple of times a month &lt;a href="https://omsi.spotlightboxoffice.com/purchase/realtime?ticketID=2"&gt;at my local science museum&lt;/a&gt; on the weekends, but that's really all I can do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now.  You see, I believe that if a lot of people get involved with something positive, even if it's just a little bit, we can make a tremendous change.  So I have a challenge for everyone who reads this.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donate at least ten dollars&lt;/b&gt; (or ten euros, or ten pounds, or whatever's the closest equivalent in your currency) &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;volunteer at least four hours&lt;/b&gt; at whatever charitable organization you choose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When you do it, leave a comment at the bottom of this post, telling us:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;what you donated/volunteered to do,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what organization you donated to/volunteered for, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why you chose that organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
When I get 100 unique comments from people who have done this, &lt;b&gt;I will shave my head&lt;/b&gt;.  This is a big deal.  I have had long hair since I was 19 and in college:

&lt;p&gt;I only cut it short once (in 2005) to donate my hair to &lt;a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/"&gt;locks of love&lt;/a&gt;.  I have &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; shaved my head.  And I will do this -- and post pictures -- as soon as we reach our goal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm also curious to learn about what all of your favorite charities are!  Spread the word, because I would &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; to not just meet my goal of 100 donations of time or money, but to exceed it by as much as possible!

There's taking action in the big broad sense--campaigns to get &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/support_accessible_communications_and_video_hr_3101"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/urge_congress_to_pass_the_autism_treatment_acceleration_act_of_2009"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt;, calls for greater &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/support_awareness_understanding_of_uneven_skills_in_autistics"&gt;understanding&lt;/a&gt;---and then there's the small and daily works of advocacy that one attempts, just to make things a bit better, or so one hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was hot and humid and sticky here in the Garden State. Charlie and Jim went on a late morning bike ride (Charlie had slept in) after which eating ice cream (or rather, something like ice cream made without dairy products, which are not for Charlie) straight from the carton while watching YouTube was a highly preferred activity. The steaminess seemed only to worsen as the day progressed and we headed for the YMCA to do "swim and gym."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we walked in I glanced at the pool and saw that it was divided in half with a lane marker, and that five chartreuse shirted teenagers were sitting on a bench. Prior visits had taught me that the five were camp counselors and that the right side of the pool, where Charlie habitually gets in, would be "off limits" unless you were a camper. Also, the pool toys that Charlie loves--a floating airplane and a car---were on the campers-only side of the pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie, as expected, walked to the right side of the pool, stood and looked around, and got in. I paused and then went over to the counselors, mentioned Charlie and autism and how he's used to swimming on that side of the pool and that I would try to get him to swim on the other side. "It's fine for him to swim here," said the counselor, adding that there were only a few campers today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie had gotten into the water and was making his way towards the airplane, grinning from ear to ear (literally). He spent the next five minutes trying to pull himself up onto the back of the plane as a boy some years younger was trying to climb on its side. I stood watching as the airplane tipped over when both boys were trying to climb on it simultaneously from different angles. Charlie looked a little annoyed at one point but just kept trying to get on until the other boy who drifted off. Charlie then gave me a look and a "yes" when I asked him if he wanted me in the water. I helped him push the airplane to the deep end and he spent a half-hour kicking and floating while I did some laps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 5pm approached, everyone got our. A lifeguard told me that it would be adult lap swimming soon. I noted that Charlie might take a little longer to get out and she said, no problem. Still on the airplane, he kicked back to the deep end and turned around. One of the pool managers was pulling the other toys out of the pool. I remember when she was a lifeguard in the days when Charlie had to go down the pool slides at least two dozen times per visit; she always gave him a smile and laughed to see us at the top of the stairs, yet again. Since then, we've often seen her and noted that she's risen in the ranks (to everyone's advantage---I've noted that she's always attentive to both the staff and to swimmers and parents, and very polite).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pool manager asked me to unwind a rope that had gotten caught on the lane marker. I did so and then swam to the shallow end and got out of the pool. Charlie was still floating around on the airplane and kicked his way in slowly. He got off (deplaned?) and was wading towards the stairs, leaving the airplane in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Charlie, can you get the airplane for me?" the pool manager asked, squatting at the side of the pool and looking at him. And Charlie turned around, took hold of the tail of the airplane, and pushed it to the pool manager who thanked him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave Charlie a big smile and a towel. Lately, he doesn't seem to like excessive displays of praise as we used to do when he was younger and tossed him in the air, clapped and chortled. It was just a small instance of him following directions, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how the small things do add up.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247906651253"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_355.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee15144c7d19ac5f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-18T08:57:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T08:57:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/WKfmD6kHHS4/clock_quotes_355.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_355.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We live in oppressive times.

It wasn’t all Haight-Ashbury and pot and hippies with flowers in their hair.  I spent a couple of years in the military in the early 1960s down at the Cape launching early versions of Polaris missiles into the Atlantic missile range, or sometimes into the Banana River if the range safety officer saw fit to push the destruct button.  (As a side benefit I got to participate in the Cuban blockade in 1962 aboard a U.S. Navy ship.)  Those were the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury" rel="external "&gt;Project Mercury&lt;/a&gt; years of the manned space program, and one would occasionally see one or another of the original seven astronauts around the Cape or in Cocoa Beach (anyone remember the &lt;a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum41/HTML/000137.html" rel="external "&gt;Cape Colony Inn?&lt;/a&gt;), and we’d marvel at how they’d stuff themselves into a tiny Mercury capsule atop an Atlas rocket and blast away into near-earth space.  Watching those launches in 1962 and 1963 I never thought then that I’d work on their successor systems and watch the fruits of that work take men to the moon.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/369234main_lroc_apollo11labeled_256x256.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most readers of science blogs already know, the Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter has just returned photos of five of the six &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html" rel="external "&gt;Apollo landing sites&lt;/a&gt; on the moon, including one (Apollo 14) where the foot trails made by astronauts are visible!  And those are preliminary images.  The LRO team promises 2x or 3x better resolution when the orbiter is in its final orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those sites is special to me.  In the mid and late 1960s I was a member of a group in Honeywell’s Development and Evaluation Laboratory (later in the Systems &amp;amp; Research Center) that was charged with stress testing components of the Apollo Command Module control system.  We tortured reaction jet controllers, abused thrust vector servo assemblies, and kicked around translation and rotation hand controls for months.  We soaked them in vacuum chambers, cycling the temperature up and down on a 12-hours on, 12 hours off schedule, subjected them to over-voltages and under-voltages, shook them on vibration tables, and generally tried to see how bad we could treat them before they failed.  Out of all that testing came the final versions that were installed in Apollo Command Modules and flew in them, including the version that flew in Apollo 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day that the Eagle – the Lunar Excursion Module associated with the Apollo 11 flight – landed at Tranquility Base, my wife and I had gone to the Minneapolis Humane Society to adopt our first dog, Beau.  We got home in time to watch the television broadcast and see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7c-PbfnQuw" rel="external "&gt;the blurry video&lt;/a&gt; of Neil Armstrong stepping off the LEM ladder.  (R.I.P. Walter Cronkite, who broadcast the landing that day in 1969 and who died yesterday.)  It was an amazing feeling – a combination of elation and relief – to know that the landing had been successful.  All the people who worked on the manned space flight projects over the years after John F. Kennedy committed us to going to the moon within a decade were proud to have contributed to the mission.  I sure was that day, and I still am.  I left the Apollo program after our part of Apollo 11’s development was finished to work on other prototype spacecraft and aircraft systems, but knowing stuff I worked on took humans to the moon is something I’ll be proud of until I die.&lt;/p&gt;

I guess now is as good a time as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that has always bothered me is the passage in the Book of Mormon that is always presented to potential new members (the church refers to them as "investigators") as a litmus test they can use to determine whether the things they are being told are true or not.  The passage reads as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.&lt;br&gt;---&lt;a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/10/4#4"&gt;Moroni 10:4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okaaaaay.... so let me get this straight:  I should ask the voice in my head whether these things are true or not, and if I approach the question &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; having faith in the teachings, with a real intent to have the voice in my head tell me it's true, and with a sincere heart hoping for it to be true.... then the voice in my head might tell me it's true?  Shocking!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm pretty sure that if you try hard enough to believe in anything, you can make yourself believe it.  This is not exactly an earth-shattering observation.  And yet, it's supposed to be one of the most convincing "proofs" of the validity of the Book of Mormon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the BoM had been written a century later, this verse probably would have recommended &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve"&gt;clapping your hands&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2053043505364609961?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247895816311"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-9031516391098107721">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64b11d298f164650</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="accomodationism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Oh noes!

There aren&amp;#39;t many left of the old structuralist tradition in biology, the kind of non-genetic purists who tried to analyze development in terms of the fundamental physical and chemical properties of the organism—they&amp;#39;ve been swallowed up and lost in a triumphal molecular biology research program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edge has a nice &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/goodwin/goodwin_index.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with and &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/ThirdCulture/k-Ch.4.html"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; by Goodwin — they&amp;#39;re good places to start. If that whets your appetite, you should also read his book, &lt;i&gt;How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1247885571/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=1247885571&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=1247885571&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=1247885571" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is aimed at general audiences and is a good overview of why we should look at more than just genes to explain form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was an advocate for one view of nature, and I think he missed the mark by neglecting genes as much as he did; we know now that a lot of details of morphology are directly affected in subtle and not-so-subtle ways by the genetics of the organism. But I think we can also make a case that the modern molecular biological approach is also missing a significant element. Every biologist ought to read a little Goodwin, just to leaven their picture of how biology works with his special perspective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/brian_goodwin_1931-2009.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/QuDOiyfHpiI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247889650998"><id gr:original-id="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=350">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a85c7f21f0039666</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Human Rights"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">No “Sympathy” For Jenny McCarthy</title><published>2009-07-18T03:45:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T03:45:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=350" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation’s&lt;/a&gt; TAM7 meeting took place in Las Vegas last week. This year’s meeting included a panel discussion entitled, “Anti Anti-Vaccination”. As scienceblogger, and panelist &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt; notes in a recent post about “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/enablers_of_the_anti-vaccine_movement.php"&gt;Enablers of the vaccine-autism manufactroversy&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the issues that came up over which there was somewhat of a disagreement is exactly how to deal with prominent antivaccine activists, people such as Jenny McCarthy. The majority opinion seemed to be that being too blunt or hurling insults is ineffectual if we want to change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another point to consider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While hurling insults probably&lt;em&gt; is &lt;/em&gt;ineffectual, there is an important point underlying something that was brought up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the anti anti-vax panel discussion at TAM7, it was pondered aloud by the emcee/moderator that perhaps Jenny McCarthy’s apparent position merits “sympathy”. This seemed to be supported (albeit, in the form of a question), with the notion that having a child with autism [and possibly likely associated challenges] results in parents “looking for something to blame”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy’s position has been to “blame” childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most rational thinkers are well aware of the state of the science, for which no reliable data of high quality supports the notion in general that childhood vaccines contribute to the etiology of autism. However, it’s possible that not everyone has taken the opportunity to examine some of the detailed implications of suggesting that Jenny McCarthy’s situation warrants some sort of “sympathetic” consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s my hope that readers will consider this position carefully, and that perhaps it will impact how autism is seen and discussed among skeptics in the future. My point is not to criticize what was said/asked, rather it is to point out that what was said/asked can remain empathetic and skeptical, without perpetuating desructive sterotypes of autistic people. It’s got to be considered thoughtfully in advance, and consist of clear and well-communicated perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sympathy or fallacious logic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy’s very public statements about vaccines contribute to undermining the public confidence in the vaccination program in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To suggest that her situation is “able to be comprehended” is one thing. There is little disagreement that there are many parents of children with autism out there who don’t (or didn’t) do well with the uncertainty such a diagnosis brings (pervasive scientific uncertainty about causation, as well as general uncertainty about future that many parents inevitably face). In the context of a behavioral disorder which is sometimes &lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=107"&gt;ill-defined at best&lt;/a&gt;, and one that mostly lacks pervasive and clear etiological explanations (so far), it is not difficult to see that many parents probably find it hard to resist easy, yet completely unsupported answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the mere suggestion of “sympathy” for this particular situation, and in the context of anti-vaccination advocates, is dangerously close to very fallacious logic. At best, it can be a simple emotional appeal. While the suggestion may not have been meant in this way, for some who heard the question at TAM7, it may be easy to think there’s a good underlying reason to really “feel sorry” for Jenny McCarthy, or any parents of autistic children for that matter. Besides the fact that this is absolutely irrelevant to the incorrectness of Jenny McCarthy’s many statements about vaccines, it’s a potentially destructive position with respect to autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jenny McCarthy merits any “sympathy”, it is for a very important set of reasons - Jenny McCarthy may not do well with uncertainty, she very likely lacks a sufficient education in basic science, and she demonstrates a prominent absence of critical thinking skills (see her Indigo Child nonsense as well). In a nutshell, she appears to have willingly and easily jumped aboard the anti-vaccination bandwagon. We should feel “sympathetic” that she has been failed by society to acquire the appropriate tools to deal with her situation in a way that is more consistent with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the potential applicability of “sympathy” for someone like Jenny McCarthy is to be discussed, skeptics should consider making those reasons very clear. To leave them unclear, even if inadvertently, opens the door for the devaluation of autistic kids and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The destructive potential of “sympathy”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than her own lack of critical thinking, understanding Jenny McCarthy’s situation does not require use of the word “sympathy”, which in terms of families of people with disabilities, conjures images worthy of fear and pity all too often in the eyes of the public. Yes, an autistic child, or a child with any disability, can present a set of challenges that many people find difficult. Those challenges may not be familiar to the public at large. Such is life. If anyone begins to suggest “sympathy” &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; someone has an autistic or disabled child, the message this communicates to and about that child, and other people who happen to be similar, is quite clear. The autistic child is often seen as the direct source of difficulty and the origin of emotional distress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parental difficulty and emotional distress are not things that are intrinsic to any disability (autism or otherwise) or to any one person. They are a product of challenging circumstances, and a person’s (in those circumstances) ability to function within the situation. This is not to say that it is, or should be, “easy”. But it is to say that adaptation to challenging circumstances is not required simply because an offspring is autistic is disabled - adaptation is required because preconceived expectations were not met and because there are differences that benefit from perspectives and approaches that may seem atypical, or may need to be learned and practiced in order to master. In other words, having an autistic child is not inherently problematic, rather delay or impairment in adaptation as parent can have profound consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s not really played, to bring out the unqualified “sympathy” card for Jenny McCarthy because words like “autism”, “disability”, and “looking to place blame” arise in a conversation does a potential disservice to autistic people. It can lead to them being portrayed as a problem, something to be pitied, and even something to be feared. One potential consequence of such fear and pity if it’s placed, is to chip away at the value of those persons in society. How often are terms like “disruptive” and “meltdown” used to describe autistic children in a classroom? Any school-age child has great potential “to be disruptive”. But such a stereotype, especially when tagged to an autistic child, is only perpetuated by the public’s uncritical acceptance of any notion that parents of autistic children merit or need “sympathy”. It would seem equally concerning that the consequences of this potential stereotype can carry to employment and the workplace later in life too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Having an autistic child may be so difficult, that it really may warrant consideration of some sort of sympathy for the parents when they look for something to blame”&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure the TAM7 emcee/moderator didn’t intend to convey this, but unclear statements about “sympathy” leave this possiblity out there for those who consider the matter further. If one were to publish such a statement, the anti-vaccination (and anti-autism) advocates would sing their praises. Autistic people would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t intend to conclude that the TAM7 moderator had any specific intentions other than to stimulate discussion (perhaps even play “devil’s advocate”). And other than the autism vaccine nonsense, I imagine that in-depth discussion of the implications of discussing autism doesn’t come up too frequently for most skeptics. But, for the thoughtful and scientifically-minded out there, put this in your head for future thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the opportunity to discuss Jenny McCarthy’s anti-vaccine advocacy arises, consider adding clarity for why Jenny McCarthy (or parents in similar situations) really deserve understanding. Perhaps ask questions, distinguishing the connotative meanings of “comprehending Jenny McCarthy’s seeking to place blame”, and “sympathizing with her position of lacking the critical thinking skills necessary to stick with scientific reality”. If you really want to help autistic and other disabled people, explain why “sympathy” for parents is potentially devaluing in the context of having, or *because of* an autistic/disabled child. A parent who is looking to explain or place blame for causation, certainly deserves our understanding of the mechanics of this desire, but “sympathy” is NOT the answer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Do'C</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism Street</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="text/html"/></source></entry></feed>
