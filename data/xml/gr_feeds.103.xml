The disagreement revolves around an article by Kathleen McAuliffe in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/mar/09-they-dont-make-homo-sapiens-like-they-used-to"&gt;Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  The article describes Hawks and colleagues' &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/52/20753"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; report of substantially accelerated selection in humans following the agricultural revolution and related explosion of population size.  It's important to draw a distinction between the data and the reporting thereof, as I have tried to do previously when I &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2007/12/evolution-with-bullet.html"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; about Hawks et al.'s descriptions of their work in popular articles.

What best explains why the Amish children stay in the Amish fold if they never leave their particular small culture? What best explains the fact that many young people lose their faith when they get out of such a church environment by attending a University? And isn’t it obvious that if a child is told s/he should not doubt but have faith or else s/he will be eternally punished that this provides a very strong firewall against honest doubt? Child molesters tell their victims not to tell anyone or else they might be killed. Is that much different? And isn’t it obvious that this whole process is best described as &lt;a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology/Social/Persuasion_and_Social_Influence/Brainwashing//"&gt;brainwashing&lt;/a&gt; or mind control? What is it, if that doesn’t explain it? And isn’t it obvious that most of us could be &lt;a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology/Social/Persuasion_and_Social_Influence/"&gt;persuaded or manipulated&lt;/a&gt; into thinking and doing what we normally would consider false or wrong? Doesn’t the malleability of human thinking alone call upon us all to be skeptics? I think so. If you disagree, why not?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The characteristics of a brainwashed person are 1) xenophobia, or the fear of outsiders, an us/them mentality (which includes the fear of reading what those who disagree write); 2) A high degree of emotionally attachment to a belief; 3) That a person highly prefers his/her beliefs are true. And, 4) wishful thinking, which clouds a person’s judgment. There are other factors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Believers are blinded by their passions because they have been brainwashed by their culture. Our culturally inherited beliefs are what we use to “see” with. These inherited beliefs are much like our very eyes themselves, so it’s extremely difficult to examine that which we use to see with. We cannot easily pluck out our eyes to look at them since we use our eyes to see. But we must do this if we truly want to examine that which we were taught to believe. &lt;strong&gt;Again, it’s a simple fact that brainwashed people do not know they have been brainwashed!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-7349275700365587430?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moths need just the essence of a flower's scent to identify it, according to new research from The University of Arizona in Tucson. Although a flower's odor can be composed of hundreds of chemicals, a moth uses just a handful to recognize the flower.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Naked mole rats resemble pink, wrinkly, saber-toothed sausages and would never win a beauty contest, even among other rodents. But these natives of East Africa are the champs for longevity among rodents, living nine times longer than similar-sized mice. Not only do they have an extraordinarily long lifespan, but they maintain good health for most of it and show remarkable resistance to cancer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;University of Montana researcher Scott Mills and his students have noticed an exceptional number of white snowshoe hares on brown earth. He contends that climate change and the color mismatch are causing much more hare mortality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An international team of scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Berlin, Germany, and the University of Sheffield, UK, now answered the question how social status is inherited in one of the most social of all mammals, the spotted hyena.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It’s written by Michael Haber, but a search hasn’t turned up much about him. It’s pretty funny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emboldened by their success in declaring Pluto not a planet, the International Astronomical Union determined this week by a close vote that February is too short to be considered a true month. It has, however, been granted the newly created status of “dwarf month.” It shares this dubious distinction with several other calendar time spans, including Labor Day Weekend, Christmas Vacation, and the Time Between When You Were Supposed to Get Your Oil Changed and When You Actually Did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It only seems fair,” said IAU President Ron Eckers. “February reaches a peak size of 29 days, averaging only 28 days for 75 percent of the time. Recent research has shown that other periods, such as the Time Between When You Were Supposed to Get Your Oil Changed and When You Actually Did, often exceed this meager time frame. In fact, this erratic behavior only strengthens our case that February does not belong in the same classification as the eleven ‘true’ months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eckers also warned that the crop of 30-day “so-called” months should be careful to maintain their number of days. “They’re already cutting it pretty close in my book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that pretty much nails it on the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hey, if you know of (or are) Michael Haber, pipe up in the comments. This was pretty good! &lt;/p&gt;

In fact, doing so is far more justified, given that last week she was quoted in an &lt;a href="http://omg.yahoo.com/news/jenny-mccarthy-on-playboy-botox-husband-jim-carrey/19433?nc"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; as singing paeans of praise to one of the most deadly poisons known to humankind: Botulinum toxin. &lt;a href="http://www.michiganavemag.com/MA_MA09_084_NEW.html"&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think plastic surgery is fun if it makes you feel good. I'm all for looking better, so I plan on doing whatever I want when the time comes. I love Botox, I absolutely love it. I get it minimally, so I can still move my face. But I really do think it's a savior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irony is delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, antivaccine &lt;em&gt;macher&lt;/em&gt; J.B. Handley has willingly allowed Jenny McCarthy to supplant his position in his own organization, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, which has recently been rebranded as "Jenny McCarthy's Autism Organization." Given that Jenny McCarthy has repeatedly characterized vaccines as full of "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/postholiday_the_stupid_it_burns_part_1_j.php"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;," so much so that that has become a standard antivaccinationist trope, I have to wonder: Does Generation Rescue now support injecting poisons into skin and muscle? If not, why not? And before anyone points out that Botox doesn't get into the bloodstream, I point out that vaccines are not "injected into the bloodstream" either, but that doesn't stop the antivaccine movement from characterizing intramuscular injections that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it's pretty hard for the most famouse spokeswoman for the antivaccine movement on the one hand to claim that vaccines are full ot "toxins" (an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we.php"&gt;antivaccinationist lie&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but it is the Official Antivaccine Propaganda line) and decry injecting them into children, while at the same time singing the praises of injecting a toxin far worse than even mercury into her skin. To her, injecting babies and children with vaccines that prevent many horrific dieseases and have saved more lives in the history of medicine than any other medical intervention ever devised by physicians is scary and horrible because of her irrational fear that it somehow causes autism, but injecting an incredibly lethal toxin into her face to keep her from looking old is not only hunky dory but a "savior," as is having plastic surgery. Apparently McCarthy actually does implicitly understand the dictum that the "dose makes the poison" for Botox. Why can't she understand that the dictum applies to formaldehyde, mercury, and all the other horrific "toxins" she fears in vaccines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the intellectual face of the antivaccine movement? This is the best they could come up with? After all, earlier in the same interview, she says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the increase in the number of vaccinations, there has been an increase in autism. I can understand why the other side won't admit to it, because they're afraid of all of these deadly diseases coming back and people not vaccinating [their children]. But right now, you've got a 1 in 84 chance of a boy having autism. Those numbers, to me, are a lot scarier than my kid getting the chicken pox. And that's where I get so upset with people thinking that I am part of an antivaccine group. Everyone is missing the point here. It is: Slow down the vaccines, pick the ones that are the most important to you, and clean out the horrible ingredients that are still in there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jenny, you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; part of an antivaccine group. Period. In fact, you are its public face. You are also too dumb to understand that correlation does not equal causation. We've had an enormous increase in the use of the Internet since the early 1990s. Hey, maybe Internet use causes autism! So be as "upset" as you like; I don't care. The truth hurts, and I keep hoping against hope that through pain comes wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that I probably hope in vain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/jenny_mccarthy_absolutely_loves_injectin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/ZT1kS3LE3qU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236440116104"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1547239442227961048">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25dbca3eee042d92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Streetcar We Desire</title><published>2009-03-07T15:19:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-07T15:34:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/streetcar-we-desire.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1547239442227961048/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1547239442227961048" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Last night we rode the atheist streetcar for about an hour and a half through downtown Toronto.

Narisetti proposes that the choice of religious belief or non-belief should be deferred till adulthood. Just as most societies recognise that marriage and civic responsibilities such as voting are adult prerogatives that children should not be allowed to exercise, so should the choice of a belief system wait till an individual is competent to exercise mature judgement."&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In this controversial critique of the UN convention, humanist Narisetti cites numerous examples of the ways in which early religious indoctrination leads to later negative attitudes such as intolerance, suspicion, and outright hostility directed toward those who believe differently. He also notes that religion provides a cloak for such obvious evils as sexual abuse, genital mutilation, and corporal punishment of children. While most societies are quick to condemn such abuses, Narisetti suggests that they should be willing to take the next logical step and look to the role of religion in such problems." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes ideas take a long time to germinate and become accepted. This proposal may be many decades away from being accepted, but the case has now been made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-263500686509247602.gif?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It turns out that that was a &lt;i&gt;moderate compromise&lt;/i&gt; — the original version of the resolution &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/03/the_first_draft_of_ok_legislat.php"&gt;attacked the University of Oklahoma department of zoology&lt;/a&gt;. Look closely at the language in this motion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, the University of Oklahoma is a publicly funded institution which should be open to all ideas and should train students in all disciplines of study and research and to use independent thinking and free inquiry, not indoctrinate students in one-sided study and thinking; and
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WHEREAS, the Department of Zoology at the University of Oklahoma has, as evidenced on the departmental homepage, been framing the Darwinian theory of evolution as doctrinal dogmatism rather than a hypothetical construction within the disciplines of the sciences; and
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WHEREAS, not only has the Department of Zoology at the University of Oklahoma been engaged in one-sided indoctrination of an unproven and unpopular theory but has made an effort to brand all thinking in dissent of this theory as anti-intellectual and backward rather than nurturing such free thinking and allowing a free discussion of all ideas which is the primary purpose of a university; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realize that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/02/john_west.php"&gt;John West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/02/casey_luskin.php"&gt;Casey Luskin&lt;/a&gt; toddled into Oklahoma a few weeks ago, and put 2 + 2 together.

&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="http://blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2009.06617"&gt;Musical experience and neural efficiency – effects of training on subcortical processing of vocal expressions of emotion&lt;/a&gt;, is published in the &lt;a href="http://blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2009.06617.x"&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. 30 right-handed men and women with and without music training (aged 19-35) were asked to watch a subtitled nature film while simultaneously hearing a 250-millisecond fragment of a distressed baby’s cry; the participants wore scalp electrodes. The results were not quite what was expected. The researchers "........found that musicians’ brainstems lock onto the complex part of the sound known to carry more emotional elements but de-emphasize the simpler (less emotion conveying) part of the sound"---and that this was not the case for those who were not musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguing that it's the part of a sound that is "known to carry more emotional elements" that the musicians' brains focus on. The study's authors have some further observations about emotion and sound in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303161427.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists already know that emotion is carried less by the linguistic meaning of a word than by the way in which the sound is communicated,” says [Dana] Strait [the study's lead author]. A child’s cry of “Mommy!” -- or even his or her wordless utterance -- can mean very different things depending on the acoustic properties of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northwestern researchers measured brainstem processing of three acoustic correlates (pitch, timing and timbre) in musicians and non-musicians to a scientifically validated emotion sound. The &lt;em&gt;musicians, who learn to use all their senses to practice and perform a musical piece [my emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;, were found to have “finely tuned” auditory systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fine-tuning appears to lend broad perceptual advantages to musicians. “Previous research has indicated that musicians demonstrate greater sensitivity to the nuances of emotion in speech,” says [Richard] Ashley [an associate professor of music cognition], who explores the link between emotion perception and musical experience. One of his recent studies indicated that musicians might even be able to sense emotion in sounds after hearing them for only 50 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pardon the pun, but the study's results struck me (happily) as a no-brainer. Music and the music of the human voice are how emotion is conveyed in our household. It's not just what Jim, Charlie and I say to each other that says how we're feeling, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we use our voices. Often it seems more the tone and pitch and melody of our voices gets the message across the Charlie, the words somewhat secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this study resonates with my own experience, the study's authors themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.... also note that the acoustic elements that musicians process more efficiently are the very same ones that children with language disorders, such as dyslexia and autism, have problems encoding. “It would not be a leap to suggest that children with language processing disorders may benefit from musical experience,” says [Nina] Kraus [the Hugh Knowles Professor of Communication Sciences and Neurobiology].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strait, a pianist and oboe player who formerly worked as a therapist with autistic children, goes a step further. Noting that impaired emotional perception is a hallmark of autism and Asberger’s syndromes, she suggests that musical training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I concur with Kraus: "Musical experience" and, in particular, &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/innovative-piano-a-tale-of-two-music-books/"&gt;piano lessons&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/teaching-strategy-16-first-lessons-in-piano-and-cello/"&gt;cello lessons&lt;/a&gt; have been of multifaceted benefit, from listening skills to fine motor coordination to even reading. Recently Charlie's been entranced listening to his iPod, after his teacher taught him to wear headphones and then started playing ocean sounds and Coldplay for him (the whole class apparently likes Coldplay). He's been going to sleep with his puffy noise-canceling headphones over his ears or beside him on the bed, the little silver machine tucked in beside him. He used to sing "Frère Jacques" when he was upset; maybe listening to the Beatles and the Byrds he'll be singing a new song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And yes, that is the cello Charlie uses in the photo.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236414528060"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2433">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/997da044e3fc6fce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="Watchmen"/><title type="html">Watchmen humor</title><published>2009-03-07T08:27:22Z</published><updated>2009-03-07T08:27:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/watchmen-humor/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, this isn’t very science or skeptical-related but I couldn’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saw the film and really liked it. I even like the different ending in the film better than the one in the novel. In the film version, I think it’s even clearer that the final question the audience is left with at the end concerns a common religious argument.   But I came across these amusing videos and thought they were funny as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’ve seen the film, feel free to comment your thoughts, particularly if you have something interesting to say about the philosophical aspects of the story. I would love to hear people’s opinions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To me it is obvious that Morality fits in a category of phenomena that derive from self-organization.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_organization#Self-organization_in_human_society"&gt;Self-organization&lt;/a&gt; is commonly spoken about, even by scientists whether they mean to or not, as having some kind of intent or intelligence behind it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONFUSING INTANGIBLES WITH TANGIBLES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we do this because we are used to talking and thinking about objects.  So we use those common patterns of speech as pre-made patterns of phrases to express ourselves because it is convenient for the speaker and the listener.  It's so embedded in the English language and culture, in the heuristics we use day to day, even skilled thinkers such as scientists speak as though processes have intent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a way Morality is like math. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is a representation of concepts that have natural relationships that exist and must be discovered to appreciate.  In fact, in the days of Pythagoras, math was considered mystical, even divine, being objective and having "forms", and "essence".  Its legacy in philosophy can be traced to the concept of the "essence" of humans, or "the soul".  But that's a topic for another article half-done in my Googledocs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Math is the process of applying values to representations of objects and intangibles to manipulate the relationships between them to assess different outcomes.  The rules of Math are not so much "invented" as discovered.  The rules of math are observations recorded for re-use.  In the same way that mathematical rules are recorded observations of the interactions of their properties, the interactions between self-interested agents that have common properties can be recorded and given the name "Morality".  Does this mean that "moral" acts can be predicted or assessed mathematically?  I think the fact that people are comfortable predicting what someone would do in a given circumstance demonstrates that it is done informally on a day to day basis, and should someone take the time to capture that process mathematically, then I think it could be done probabilistically, similar to Game Theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A MECHANISM FOR MORALITY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Mirror neurons,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;"A mirror neuron is a neuron which fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another (especially conspecific) animal.[1] Thus, the neuron "mirrors" the behavior of another animal, as though the observer were itself acting." Mirror neurons have been shown to have a relationship to intentions, empathy and language.&lt;br&gt;Wikipedia. Wikipedia, 2008. Answers.com 04 Mar. 2009. http://www.answers.com/topic/mirror-neuron&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;An observed event.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;One agent observes another agent experiencing some event.&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;A Change of State of the feelings of the observer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;The Feeling causes an Emotion&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;such as "compassion" or "empathy". Additionally, emotion can be stimulated by input from our senses or by artificial stimulation using probes and electricity, or in some cases mirror neurons.&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Desire&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The emotion causes a desire&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Thinking&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The desire causes thinking processes.&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;How do we think about this stuff?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We use mental images, we use language, we use the processes in our brains, and we can only use what we've stored up to the moment.  How we think about things is completely dependent on our inventory of thoughts and experiences up to the point.  Additionally there is evidence that shows across cultures that people have some parameters for behavior hardwired into the brain.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem"&gt;The Trolly Problem&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that people across cultures and categories seem to have a biological algorithm for dealing with situations that distinguishes intentional and unintentional harm during a rescue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Theory of Moral Grammar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harvard University's Cognitive Evolution Laboratory was established to study moral decision making and has a &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/"&gt;"moral sense test"&lt;/a&gt; set up for visitors to test their "moral sense".  Marc D. Hauser, a biologist at Harvard, is testing a theory that people are born with a moral grammar wired into their minds by evolution. In his book, “Moral Minds”, he shows that instant moral judgments seem to be generated by the "moral grammar" which are inaccessible to the conscious mind partly because of the quick decisions that must be made in life-or-death situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;THINKING ABOUT "MORAL" BEHAVIOR AS AN OBJECT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;How do we capture it for mental storage and transmittal?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;We have to have a way to think about all the facets of the event, and how to describe it to some other mind. &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;The "Moral" Act&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;The desire and the self-talk may lead to an action and if it does then the event plus the action could be observed by a third mind and then once its all over, some value ranking goes on, judgments are made, conclusions are drawn, and now there is something to describe, to judge, and store in an inventory of experiences, to share with another mind, and either endorse, reject or ignore.&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Organizing "Moral" Acts&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Once there are more than one of these events in an inventory,  a way to think about them that reflects their similarities is needed, so we classify them, and we call it "Morality".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORALITY IS ANALOGOUS TO ECONOMICS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From what I can see, "morality" is a category of behaviors that result from the self-interest of many agents.  It is a form of self-organization of these agents according to their mental capabilities into groups behaving according to implicit rules that will become explicit in humans and has an analogy in economics.  Its like circumstances are being guided by an "Invisible Hand". "The Invisible hand" is "an economic principle, first postulated by Adam Smith, holding that the greatest benefit to a society is brought about by individuals acting freely in a competitive marketplace in the pursuit of their own self-interest."&lt;br&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Answers.com 04 Mar. 2009. http://www.answers.com/topic/invisible-hand)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The difference between Self-interest and Selfishness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see a lot of people make the claim that Adam Smith was endorsing "selfishness".  Selfish is to Self-interest as Revenge is to Justice.  While similar in concept, one is harmful and the other is not.  Selfish and Revenge are about gaining an advantage, Self-interest and Justice are about maintaining an equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Morality is really just a category of behaviors.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;If we say that a behavior that fits in the category of morality is an action by an agent that requires an investment or risk to the benefit of another, then these behaviors can be observed to cross species boundaries and get more sophisticated with the sophistication of the species.  All types of animals ranging from Apes, Whales, Dolphins, Birds, Elephants, have been documented exhibiting behavior that could be categorized as a rudimentary form of morality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real question is where does the behavior come from?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Lets trace it from its origins in an example taken from one of my experiences.  I saw a person walking their dog on a leash.  A stray dog attacked the dog on the leash and the person was struggling with separating them and not getting bit.  It made me uncomfortable. I felt like I wanted to do something about it.  From that feeling rose an emotion that caused me to start a process of thinking.  My self-talk was something like "that's not right".  I could relate to the person, and I knew how I would feel.  I could relate to the dog, it was in danger from an aggressor and at a disadvantage.  Through my emotion,  self-talk, and  narration creation process, I derived a strategy of dealing with the world.  So it seems like the feeling came from the stimulus of a situation that was "unjust" or "out of place".  The person was doing the right thing, the dog wasn't harming anyone and the stray was loose and aggressive.  I made the choice to stop my car, get out and kick the stray dog to make it leave.  But it had everything to do with visual and audible stimulus that came in through my biological receptors (eyes and ears) to set some biological process in motion that gave me the feeling, that caused the emotion, that caused me to derive a strategy for engagement with the world that I decided to take action on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;If God, then which God and how much is he involved in "Moral" behavior in non-humans? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone wants to inject God into that scenario then one has a lot of explaining to do.  Since morality emerges in other species, other cultures and religions, then if God is injected into the situation above then he has to be injected into all the other situations including those of animals and Atheists.  Why is God needed to explain it? Where does God Fit? Which god are we talking about? How does one  know which god? How can someone else verify that it is being attributed to the proper God? If God has more to do with some situations than others, where are the boundaries for understanding when and how much God is involved and when he's not?  Where is the tipping point or turning point when we can say that God is responsible for such and such moral event?  And if the claim is "the bible says" then why should anyone trust the bible when the time of origin, the place of origin, the authors, the credentials of the authors are unknown, and there are is a lot of wrong data, even inconsistent data in the bible?  The information in the Bible is of &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/search/label/IDQ"&gt;demonstrably poor quality&lt;/a&gt; when assessed using sound principles for information quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider these examples of moral behaviors derived from self interest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- I don't hit you because I don't want to get hit back.&lt;br&gt;- I grow vegetables well, Jill farms animals well, Harry is a good hunter, John makes good pants, and we all trade amongst ourselves for the things we need creating and equilibrium.  It is not in our self-interest to allow one of the other participants to feel they are at a disadvantage by becoming selfish.&lt;br&gt;- I love Jill and when she is sad it bothers me so i try to cheer her up. Cheering her up makes me feel better. &lt;br&gt;- I trade with harry and he feels bad so he's not hunting, so I try to make harry feel better so I can get more meat&lt;br&gt;- Momma ain't happy so nobody's happy, so we try to make her happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Self-Interest Related to Relations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- We have biological emotional attachments to our children, and families, these are documented in research.  Our desires to benefit them are derived in part from our emotions. The initiation of an emotion is not controllable for the most part, but we can do things to reduce the likelihood of their occurrence, or calm down, or work ourselves up, or decide to behave under the influence of the desires brought on by emotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Just Ain't Right!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't need the police to do anything with my son when he takes a twenty out of my wallet, and I don't need the church to teach my son that his behavior is unacceptable on many levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;It Just Feels Like The Right Thing To Do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what is the origin of the desire to help an "enemy"? An uncomfortable feeling.  Helping the enemy helps to resolve that uncomfortable feeling.  It just "feels like the right thing to do".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples of Aiding the Enemy &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce"&gt;Christmas Truce and Informal Armistice &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Americal Civil War had many reports of aiding the enemy&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad"&gt;The American Underground Railroad&lt;/a&gt; for rescuing slaves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language: Naming, organizing, classifying and categorizing. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Once the agents observe a phenomena and identify what it is they want to talk about, they must give the phenomena names in order to communicate what is going on in their mind.  For example they have to give "sharing" a name, give "empathy" a name then they have to define what it is that is going on.  The have to capture the phenomena in language so it can be discussed, then they can take steps to refine it and make it better, to set some parameters and boundaries, make some rules.  They have to create a mental object from an intangible in order to work with it in a discussion to manipulate it according to parameters to make predictions about it.  It's like verbal math working out the details of a moral equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Aggregate Sum Of The Values Of THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Over time, the Value of  "Pride" has changed in the moral equation.  Pride used to be a virtue during the time of the Illiad, then Pope Gregory listed it as a  deadly sin, then it re-emerged relatively recently as a behavior with positive and negative characteristics.  The process of classification of morality continues to this day.  You can see it in the news stories about legislative debates, most notably of late, legislation about the rights of homosexuals.  Its a kind of an "Evolution of Morality" similar to the idea  of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation"&gt;Evolution of Coorperation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justification For Morality Without God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Justification for how "morality" came about is its inherent utility.  The explanation starts with the feeling that causes the emotion, that creates the desire to act, which causes the action, and the result is beneficial whether it is realized or not by the agent.  If it is realized, by humans for example, then we can further organize and  classify it as a moral act and manipulate it to create a rule that can be used as a  "tool".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study of "Morality" seems to me to similar to a few other fields of study that I've listed below.  I endorse the reader to take some time to become familiar with them.

An assistant professor submits a reasonable application to NCCAM to investigate the potential metabolic and pharmacodynamic interactions of St. Johns wort with conventional chemotherapy. This was the year or year-and-a-half before SJW was known to have significant CYP3A4 inductive activity due primarily to its component, hyperforin. Said investigator used this preliminary data, not explicitly required for theNIH funding mechanism (called an R21), to question whether St. John’s wort used by depressed cancer patients might interfere with chemotherapy. The original proposal earned a priority score of 228 (as with golf, the lower the better: the best is 100, the worst is 500.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major reviewer critique was that the assistant professor, Your Humble Pharmacologist, lacked, at the time, significant natural products chemistry expertise. YHP was then doing his sabbatical in the NC Research Triangle area and wisely sought the support and expertise of the now-late Dr. Monroe Wall and surviving Dr. Manuskh Wani. These gentlemen discovered and solved the structures of taxol from &lt;em&gt;Taxus brevifolia&lt;/em&gt; and camptothecin from &lt;em&gt;Camptotheca acuminata&lt;/em&gt;. Taxol itself became a blockbuster drug for Bristol-Myers Squibb while camptothecin required water-soluble modifications to foster topotecan (Hycamptin) and irinotecan (Camptosar) that collectively saved or prolonged the lives of thousands of men and women subjected to breast, ovarian, lung, and gastrointestinal tumors. In 2003, they received the designation of an American Chemical Society &lt;a href="http://acswebcontent.acs.org/landmarks/landmarks/taxol/tax.html"&gt;National Historic Chemical Landmark&lt;/a&gt; for their three decades of work in this area. (Sadly, they received none of the profits from these drugs as their discoveries pre-dated the Bayh-Dole Act that allowed NIH funded researchers to share in the revenues of intellectual property emerging from their work.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a savvy young investigator, I sought and enlisted the assistance and support of Dr. Wall and colleagues to provide my team with world-class, natural products expertise. Stunningly, the subsequent application was awared a score of 345 (*much worse than the original) with the criticism from reviewers that all Dr. Wall did was to lend a drug development aspect to an otherwise “herbal” applicaton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, I cannot fathom who better I could have sought for natural products expertise on this grant application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, three of my colleagues and I have submitted 13 applications to NCCAM, including an application for a comprehensive Botanical Research Center grant. All 13 received unfundable scores. Among these was a 279-page application for a NCCAM Botanical Research Center - reviewed but not discussed by the evaluation panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I have taken the approach that if NCCAM were to continue its existence, I would try to be part of the solution.  I have accepted several invitations to review research and training grants for NCCAM and I am pleased to say that one or two projects that I ranked highly ended up being very productive, specifically in the area of natural products and traditional herbal medicines.  I also have some friends and valued colleagues who contribute to the scientific integrity of NCCAM. However, my collective experiences lead me to believe that they are voices quenched by the vast wilderness of the promotion and advocacy of “integrative medicine” and CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Mooney recently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/03/cam_and_the_war_on_science.php"&gt;asked the question&lt;/a&gt; as to why sci/med bloggers are up in arms about Sen Tom Harkin’s recent complaints about the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), the arm of NIH charged with funding studies to investigate the mechanisms and efficacy of modalities not currently considered mainstream medicine. I left a comment for Chris that ended up being a blog post so I’ll share it with readers here and expound a bit for good measure.The problem is that Harkin has stated that the establishment is discriminating against alternative medicine and that it seems to him that NCCAM has been doing too much to disprove the efficacy of alternative therapies. [see &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;excellent post&lt;/a&gt; by Dr David Gorski and others here at Science-Based Medicine].The story of Harkin’s amazing statements were first popularized last week by Majikthise journalist, &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2009/02/sen-harkin-national-center-for-alternative-medicine-disproves-too-much-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;Lindsay Beyerstein&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the famous Simon Fraser Univ Prof Barry L Beyerstein whose article, &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altbelief.html"&gt;Why Bogus Therapies Often Seem to Work&lt;/a&gt;, I have used often in my lectures&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lindsay &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2009/02/sen-harkin-national-center-for-alternative-medicine-disproves-too-much-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harkin used his clout on the Appropriations Committee in 1992 to create the National Office of Alternative Medicine. In 1998 he co-sponsored legislation with Republican Bill Frist to upgrade the national office to a national center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a decade later, Harkin’s disappointed that the NCCAM’s research is failing to confirm his biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin doesn’t seem to realize that by publicly pressuring an ostensibly independent research center to produce positive results, he’s undermining the credibility of the center he worked so hard to create. If even if NCCAM does come up with positive results, Harkin’s giving the scientific community an excuse to discount that research as tainted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, many things have been tested, especially &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2007/07/another_botanical_clinical_tri.php"&gt;herbal remedies&lt;/a&gt; in my field, but the majority of the results have been negative. To the contrary of Harkin’s view of NCCAM and the researchers they supported, I would submit that the PIs of these grants were primarily advocates of alternative therapies who were sorely disappointed their ideas didn’t flesh out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin seems to be espousing an advocacy role rather than a scientific role. Moreover, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;foursome&lt;/a&gt; that he brought to testify to the Senate primarily spoke of preventive medicine approaches that are not considered “alternative” but are rather being co-opted by so-called “integrative medicine” as their own since the more unscientific modalities have not proven effective. Saying that nutrition and cardiovascular preventive approaches are CAM or integrative medicine is utterly ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I submit that integrative medicine is not “transformational.” Instead, it is the thinly veiled adoption of real medicine that works to provide an air of legitimacy around the highly-questionable approaches often offered, packaging it into a new-agey vibe where “patients” can go to spa-like clinics on academic medical center campuses, and have the luxury of paying out-of-pocket for “services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the key to the integrative business model is avoiding that nasty insurance business and capturing those willing and able to pay. I am waiting for a medical economics study to confirm my informal observations but integrative medicine, IMHO, is medicine for the rich and famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe me, as a natural products pharmacologist I would love to see some of these remedies have therapeutic efficacy. They may ultimately do so if proper basic science is done first that informs the dosing schedules used for clinical trials. However, NCCAM was under political pressure to show some benefit of anything and therefore supported expensive clinical trials in premature, Hail Mary attempts to get quick and early payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, NCCAM is left with a trash heap of negative data (&lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/gems/"&gt;ginkgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/gait/"&gt;glucosamine/chondroitin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/echinacea_rr.htm"&gt;echinacea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2002/stjohnswort/pressrelease.htm"&gt;St. John’s wort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/061507.htm"&gt;shark cartilage&lt;/a&gt;) - not because the approaches are being discriminated again &lt;strong&gt;but rather because the science did not support their efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I argue that NCCAM is a victim of itself and its own establishment as an advocacy arm, not a scientific arm, of NIH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt; reader Austin wrote to ask what I thought about psiballs. Psiballs are balls of energy that you create between your hands with the power of your mind. With practice, it's reported that you can program these balls to do "complex tasks," but let's not get ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Psi-Ball"&gt;WikiHow&lt;/a&gt;, here's one way to make one of your very own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Gather your energy. This could be from your own body or from another source. You could visualize the energy entering and filling every part of your body from the Earth through your feet, or from the sky and the sun through your crown chakra.

We skeptics can even show from psychological studies that &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/01/revealing-reasoning-of-believer-review.html"&gt;people of faith don’t reason too well&lt;/a&gt;; none of us do.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many believers are willing to test what they believe by taking the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/11/take-debunking-christianity-challenge.html"&gt;Debunking Christianity Challenge&lt;/a&gt;? If Christians were really interested in the truth then those books would fly off the shelves. What I have learned is that many apologists have not even read many of the best books critical to their faith. Which of those ten books have YOU read Christian? What other books besides those ten have you read? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, there are individual scholars who can stay believers in one or more fields of study antithetical to faith, like anthropology, Biblical scholarship, psychology, archaeology and many of the branches of science, but the overwhelming trend among scholars in those fields is toward doubt. Those are the facts. This means that it's a person's personality and sociological makeup that causes an individual to continue to believe in the midst of the evidence against what s/he believes. If the trend was towards belief then you might have a point. But it isn't, not by a long shot. Want to take a stab at explaining why this is so? My explanation is brainwashing, ignorance, fear of hell, and even the fear of the loss of social relationships. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who have become atheists after embracing faith describe it as a terrible ordeal, much like pulling teeth out. They fear hell, and they fear what their families will think and do to them. It's best not to question the status quo and simply ignore doubt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians don't realize you've been given a culturally adopted set of eyes through which you see everything. You just cannot see any differently. You don't even want to try to see things differently, do you, because you're scared? Does that describe you? Yes or no? If yes,&lt;strong&gt; that is a mark of a brainwashed person&lt;/strong&gt;. If no, then take the debunking Christianity challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-5849356007583337718.gif?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One thing is certain:  a monolingual speaker of Cantonese cannot understand a monolingual speaker of Mandarin and vice versa.  There is zero intelligibility between the two languages.  In fact, even within the huge collection of speech forms that fall under the umbrella of &amp;quot;Mandarin,&amp;quot; there are many varieties that are more or less mutually unintelligible.  On July 4, 1987, I was climbing up Emei Mountain in Sichuan.  It was a hot, muggy day, and our small party (my wife, son, sister, and I) were struggling up the steep slopes.  We were astonished to see large groups of short, older ladies speeding upward.  As we listened to their chatter, we couldn&amp;#39;t understand a word of what they were saying.  My wife, who grew up in Chengdu, and so speaks Chengdu Sichuanese (Szechwanese) –  generally considered to be a variety of Mandarin — suspected that the older ladies were speaking a non-Sinitic language.  When we inquired at the little shops along the way, we were informed that the groups of pilgrims were speaking one or another type of Sichuanese from nearby districts.  Mind you, Mount Emei is only 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Chengdu City.  And even in Chengdu there are expressions that don&amp;#39;t sound like Modern Standard Mandarin, such as MO DEI LO (&amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t have any&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;there isn&amp;#39;t any&amp;quot;), LANGGE GAO DI (&amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot;), ZAGO (&amp;quot;how is it?&amp;quot;), and CHUIZI (&amp;quot;penis&amp;quot;; I&amp;#39;m not sure, but perhaps this originally meant &amp;quot;hammer&amp;quot;).  (Forgive me for not recording the tones and sounds exactly right; these are just expressions I have picked up casually — I may not even have the meanings down perfectly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is commonly claimed that there is only one "Chinese" language, and that all of the variants of that language are dialects of it.  This conception of there being only one "Chinese" language plays havoc with efforts to classify the countless varieties of Sinitic speech forms into meaningful groups, branches, languages, and dialects, as is normal for other large families or groups of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old canard that "when the dialects are written down they are the same" is simply untrue, since what gets written down are not the regional variants but standard Mandarin (and in earlier times Classical Chinese, a dead language for at least two thousand years).  If one, as a tour de force, does contrive to write unadulterated Cantonese or Taiwanese, for example, they will be as hard for a reader of Mandarin to understand as spoken Cantonese or Taiwanese is for a speaker of Mandarin to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is this:  how do we break through the taxonomic impasse presented by the claim that there is only one "Chinese" language for a billion or so speakers?  I'm hoping to establish a rational system of  classification whereby Sinitic is viewed either as a family or group of languages.  The jury is still very much out on whether Sinitic is part of a Sino-Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman, Austronesian, etc. family.  I believe that one of the main reasons for the failure to gain acceptance for any of the dozen or so external relationships that have been proposed for Sinitic is that the internal relationships of the family / group remain remain murky.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236384493558"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1210">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4124234eb1ac90be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lost in Translation"/><title type="html">Only a couple letters off</title><published>2009-03-07T00:06:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-07T00:06:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1210" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, the US Secretary of State could not locate anyone on her staff capable of finding out the Russian word that appears on reset buttons. Mrs Clinton offered Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, a gift-wrapped red button bearing the legend "Reset" in English and "Peregruzka" in Russian. &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/03/06/clinton-goofs-russian-translation-tells-diplomat-wants-overcharge-ties/"&gt;Fox News reports it here&lt;/a&gt; under a "Clinton Goofs" headline, because &lt;i&gt;peregruzka&lt;/i&gt; doesn't mean "reset": it means "overcharged" or "overloaded".  The word they were supposed to have printed on the device was "perezagruzka".  (Slavicists in Language Log's East European and Eurasian department are checking this out now; I offer this hasty note from my hotel room in the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1205"&gt;SCTTPKMCT&lt;/a&gt;, where I have no Russian reference materials.) Mr Lavrov did not let the slip lie; he pointed it out in public. Even more amazingly, the Clinton adviser Philippe Reines is reported to have protested that the word they printed "is only a couple letters off." Not much of a linguistic story, really, but Mr Lavrov did make one linguistic point out of it, commenting (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/world/europe/07diplo.html?hp"&gt;according to &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that it illustrated the need to teach Russian in the United States and English in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

It includes psychology and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/creativity_daydreaming_and_imaginative_play"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_met_gene_autism_gi_problems"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/exercise_in_adulthood_who_will_support_it"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/autism-kids-one-2295344-social-children"&gt;educational theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_EarlyOral-Manual.pdf"&gt;language and communication&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/what_is_normal_in_medicine_and_society"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/disparities_in_access_to_health_care"&gt;service delivery&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/looking_to_light_dark_age_beliefs_about_workers_with_disabilities"&gt;attitudes and belifs&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/keepon_the_robot_interacts_without_the_overload"&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt; and the engineering of assistive technology, all forms of multidisciplinary studies, and many, many other fields.  The results of research is then published in scientific journals, which have varying degrees of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Science reporting," the popular translation of scientific research by the press to the public, can frequently misrepresent the actual content of scientific studies or academic papers.  See my favorite example of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/creativity_daydreaming_and_imaginative_play"&gt;"the daydreaming study"&lt;/a&gt; which was not about daydreaming and never mentioned the term.  Problems with science reporting are so endemic that dealing with the press shows up (along with tips for scientists to cope with it) in places like &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=b_qRxkAgYQYC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=winning+the+games+scientists+play&amp;amp;ei=n_OuSe62MZj4MIeSoJIF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winning the Games Scientists Play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Carl J. Sindermann,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always keep in mind that the principal job of a reporter is to develop a story that will sell newspapers or attract and retain television viewers or radio listeners.  To this end, the reporter will not usually deliberately misrepresent what you have said, but may emphasize what to you are minor points, may weave your comments in with those of others, may use part of your statement out of context, or may eliminate many or all of the qualifications that you have placed on your conclusions.  Then the headline writer may create an erroneous impression about the already distorted content, leading you to complete frustration and a pledge never again to give even the correct time to a reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While few (any?) may be able to read and understand all of the primary sources that science reporting on autism comes from, including being able to access the articles in the first place as many journals are subscription only, I do think there is value in skimming primary sources when possible.  Even when the highly technical subject matter is incomprehensible, it's usually at least possible to make a comparison between what the press says versus what the study says to know how much &lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/grain+of+salt.html"&gt;"salt"&lt;/a&gt; to take the popular account with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my most favorite "cheat sheets" to quickly evaluating a scientific research study without reading it in depth is &lt;a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~walpole/class/cs533/papers/dylan.pdf"&gt;Efficient Reading of Papers in Science and Technology (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; (Michael J. Hason / Dylan J. McNamee).  The pamphlet was written with more engineering-type-science in mind, but the tips and advice it gives, including how to assess the relative validity and quality of the study, applies well to evaluating the quality of a research article in any field.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236381391532"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/178ec1ab3d6ffb1e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Randi Speaks: Questioning the Bible</title><published>2009-03-06T22:36:35Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T22:36:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/469-randi-speaks-questioning-the-bible.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many claims in the Bible, and James Randi casts a critical eye on the "facts" therein. It seems that the archeological record and the Biblical record are somewhat at odds, and despite protests from religious "scholars," the evidence points to the idea that Nazareth, for example, did not exist as portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One snowy weekend in January 2008, I was lucky enough to attend the Science Blogging Conference (co-organized by Bora Zivkovic our Online Discussion Expert) in NC where I networked with the great and the good of the scientific communication world. PLoS distributed free T-shirts at the event and, not surprisingly, I was warmly greeted wherever I went.

&lt;p&gt;In one session, I listened to a young health care worker based in a remote location expressing her frustration about how difficult it was for her to access any content because of her unreliable internet connection and I thought about how, even for those with a computer (which is not a given for many), web content can be a hard to reach luxury. During the ensuing discussion, some well-informed folks (Bill Hooker From Open Reading Frame, Kevin Zelnio of The Other 95% and others) asked me if PLoS "could do more to get its content into the developing world"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the rest to see what PLoS is doing about it....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it is heart-warming for me to see that our conferences are having an impact, not just being fun. Just to note that the session Liz mentioned was led by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/02/openness_is_essential_freedom.php" title=""&gt;Vedran Vucic&lt;/a&gt; and the young health care worker she mentions is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/03/think_of_a_dustfree_keypad_int.php" title=""&gt;Rose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://jove-blog.blogspot.com/2008/02/video-and-info-project.html" title=""&gt;Reis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/expanding_the_outreach_of_plos.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/BIPpNXYemQI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236380135412"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8285737581949527996.post-2818634911123961641">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c9c1721e7a99a118</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Someone else on anti-depressants and placebo</title><published>2009-03-06T17:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T17:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pyjamasinbananas.blogspot.com/2009/03/someone-else-on-anti-depressants-and.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>pj</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236380135411"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/bbc_allows_quack_janet_thompso.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/97780671dfc8a764</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">BBC allows quack Janet Thompson to promote herself on air</title><published>2009-03-06T13:00:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T13:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/bbc_allows_quack_janet_thompso.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="meridian.png" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/meridian.png" width="75" height="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The BBC has a bit of a patchy track record when it comes to promoting pseudoscience.

&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of his first moves in office 8 years ago, Bush made it illegal to spend federal money on stem cell research, and then proceeded to spin — some might say lie — about it over the rest of his Administration, vetoing attempts to overturn the ban not once but twice. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/07/the_bush_veto_the_republican_w.php"&gt;Chris Mooney has had plenty to say about that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those days, it seems, are over. With the EO, Obama will make it possible for medical researchers to have access to far more &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_line"&gt;lines of stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them the freedom to see just how valuable these cells can be. Stem cell research is very promising in opening up our understanding of — and finding potential cures for — such diseases as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, diabetes, and even cancer. We’re a long way from there, of course, but now researchers will get their chance to find these and other medical breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_research"&gt;You can read about the stem cell controversy if you’d like&lt;/a&gt; — I’m sure it will come up on the talking head shows, and I’m sure many of them will be spinning like pulsars trying to make this seem bad. But while I suspect a lot of the heads will talk about the destruction of human embryos for stem cell research, they won’t mention that these embryos — really just a tiny blob of cells numbering less than 150 in total — would have been destroyed anyway, since they were created for &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; fertilization but wound up not being needed. Yet they never seem to protest the fertilization technique &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt;. It’s baffling. I’ll be very curious to see what will be said about all this on the blogs and in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, this is a victory for science, and one that makes me hopeful for this new Administration’s view toward science. We have a long, long way to go to fix the wrongs over the past decade, but this is an excellent step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236376892926"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/violence_among_autistic_rare_expert_says">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a1f892599f360395</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Violence Among Autistic Rare, Expert Says</title><published>2009-03-06T22:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T22:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/violence_among_autistic_rare_expert_says" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="ht_steuernagel_walker_090210_mn" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/ht_steuernagel_walker_090210_mn-300x225.jpg" height="165" alt="Trudy Steuernagel and her son, Sky Walker" width="250"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Walker is charged with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;killing his mother&lt;/a&gt;, Trudy Steuernagel. Says Barbara Yavorcik, executive director of the Autism Society of America, Ohio Chapter, and the mother of a teenager on the spectrum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;''This type of violence is no more prevalent in the autistic population than in any other population.......And people should not be afraid.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They just made it worse. The &lt;a href="http://www.feministing.com/archives/014073.html"&gt;Roman Catholic Church of Brazil has excommunicated everyone involved in the abortion&lt;/a&gt;, except the child, who was excused on grounds of her age. Old enough to be raped and bear children, but not old enough to be responsible for decisions about her reproductive tract, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this when anyone tries to tell you about their god of love, their religion of mercy, their source of all moral virtue.&lt;/p&gt;

The younger Free-Ride offspring would like to report on a recent field trip to the &lt;a href="http://msnucleus.org/"&gt;Math/Science Nucleus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/b&gt; What's a nucleus anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/b&gt; It's what's at the center of things.  The cells in your body have nuclei, and so do the atoms that those cells are made of.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't read it in detail yet, but it is refreshing to see someone discussing the possibility that not everything that happens in the cell is optimized, given that we know various processes that generate nonfunctional parts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Any engineered device should certainly not contain nonfunctional components, for this would be a waste of energy and money. In contrast, evolutionary theory tells us that biological systems need not be optimized and may very well accumulate nonfunctional elements. Mutational and demographic processes contribute to the cluttering of eukaryotic genomes and transcriptional networks with "junk" DNA and spurious DNA binding sites. Here, we question whether such a notion should be applied to protein interactomes—that is, whether these protein interactomes are expected to contain a fraction of nonselected, nonfunctional protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which we term "noisy." We propose a simple relationship between the fraction of noisy interactions expected in a given organism and three parameters: (i) the number of mutations needed to create and destroy interactions, (ii) the size of the proteome, and (iii) the fitness cost of noisy interactions. All three parameters suggest that noisy PPIs are expected to exist. Their existence could help to explain why PPIs determined from large-scale studies often lack functional relationships between interacting proteins, why PPIs are poorly conserved across organisms, and why the PPI space appears to be immensely large. Finally, we propose experimental strategies to estimate the fraction of evolutionary noise in PPI networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E. D. Levy, C. R. Landry, S. W.

And the mechanism is cool -- an &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Alu&lt;/span&gt; insertion knocked it out and an ERV insertion restored its function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Author summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;IRG&lt;/i&gt; gene family plays an important role in defense against intracellular bacteria, and genome-wide association studies have implicated structural variants of the single-copy human &lt;i&gt;IRGM&lt;/i&gt; locus as a risk factor for Crohn's disease. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of this region among primates and show that the ancestral tandem gene family contracted to a single pseudogene within the ancestral lineage of apes and monkeys. Phylogenetic analyses support a model where the gene has been “dead” for at least 25 million years of human primate evolution but whose ORF became restored in all human and great ape lineages. We suggest that the rebirth or restoration of the gene coincided with the insertion of an endogenous retrovirus, which now serves as the functional promoter driving human gene expression.

I did what conventional wisdom recommended at the time: stuck all the money into a mutual fund. I chose an "ethical" one, that doesn't invest in the arms trade etc., but I don't think that's the reason that the whole move proved to be a financial mistake. (The fund in question has a good &lt;a href="http://morningstar.se/"&gt;Morningstar rating&lt;/a&gt;.) My share in that fund has never to my knowledge even been worth what I originally paid for it, and the simple reason is that apparently I bought near the top of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I got an investment suggestion that seems exceedingly silly to me. When I bought that share in the mutual fund, I in effect paid a trained person to perform a task for me that I lack necessary skills for: to act as a middleman and invest my money wisely in stocks. Though this guy did an industry-standard job, I still lost money. Today, a Swedbank representative suggested that I move the money into his bank's meta-fund. I don't know the correct word for this in any language, but the idea was that I would pay trained middleman #1 to invest my money wisely in various &lt;i&gt;mutual funds&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that he would select a trained middleman #2 and pay him to invest my money wisely in stocks. And somehow the combined skill of these two groups of people would give me a better result than if only one middleman separated me from my investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, Mr Swedbank didn't say that it would give a better result, only that he hoped so. And when I explained that I couldn't see how introducing an extra middleman would improve my chances, he had no reply to give. So my money, what little is left of it after the credit crunch, still languishes in that old mutual fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should just have bought gold and buried it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/gonzo_investment_suggestion.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/V39zzICNyoY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236366131441"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4153">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c95e781acf05b770</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="Iceland"/><category term="Michael Lewis"/><title type="html">What Do Fishermen and Investment Bankers Have in Common?</title><published>2009-03-06T22:44:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T22:44:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/1RO1FM1xSBo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/what-do-fishermen-and-investment-bankers-have-in-common/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Icelanders love taking insane risks.

&lt;p&gt;On March 8th, I'll go to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecafes.org/event_pages/Boston1.html" title=""&gt;Science Cafe&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;THE TOPIC:

&lt;p&gt;It may seem Hollywood, but there are many accomplished scientists currently scanning the skies for signs of alien intelligence. What are they looking for? Flying saucers and little green men?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, think talk radio and TV soap operas. We've been broadcasting signals like these for around 80 years, and some are powerful enough to reach other star systems. So there is a chance that aliens are out there broadcasting similar signals--signals we may be able to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how will we know a signal is from intelligent life? What will we do when we find one? Will we be able to translate it? Why is the idea of aliens so compelling? Is this worth spending money on? Are aliens possessed by reality TV too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard physicist Paul Horowitz has been a part of the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence since before ET ever phoned home. Join Paul and Cafe Sci this Sunday for great conversation, food, and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starts at 6:30pm, Sunday, March 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middlesex Lounge (www.middlesexlounge.us  )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;315 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's going to be fun for sure: science+pizza+beer, who can ask for more? So, if you come to that, try to spot me in the crowd and say Hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, on Monday, March 9, 2009 at 6:00pm, we'll meet at &lt;a href="http://www.casablanca-restaurant.com/" title=""&gt;Casablanca Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; which is at 40 Brattle Street, Cambridge, MA.

&lt;p&gt;Science Cafe, Durham: Re-Kindling Wood Energy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duke professor Dan Richter does his bit at "Periodic Tables," talking about Europe's new alternative fuel -- firewood. He says Advanced Wood Combustion, AWC, might provide North America with a clean, affordable, abundant, and decentralized stream of renewable energy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Climate change is already having a detectable impact on birds across Europe, says a Durham University and RSPB-led scientific team publishing their findings to create the world's first indicator of the climate change impacts on wildlife at a continental scale.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;North American scientists studying West Nile virus have shown that more diverse bird populations can help to buffer people against infection. Since the virus first spread to North America it has reached epidemic proportions and claimed over 1,100 human lives. "This is an important example of the links between biodiversity and human health", commented Dr Stuart Butchart, BirdLife's Global Research and Indicators Coordinator.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An international team of archaeologists has uncovered the earliest known evidence of horses being domesticated by humans. The discovery suggests that horses were both ridden and milked. The findings could point to the very beginnings of horse domestication and the origins of the horse breeds we know today. Led by the Universities of Exeter and Bristol (UK), the research is published on Friday 6 March 2009 in journal Science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientists identified seven new species of bamboo coral discovered on a NOAA-funded mission in the deep waters of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Six of these species may represent entirely new genera, a remarkable feat given the broad classification a genus represents.*&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The quick decline of a tiny shrimp-like species, known scientifically as Diporeia, is related to the aggressive population growth of non-native quagga mussels in the Great Lakes, say NOAA scientists. As invasive mussel numbers increase, food sources for Diporeia and many aquatic species have steadily and unilaterally declined.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CALL FOR PAPERS
International Conference for Digital Libraries and the Semantic Web (ICSD2009) 
September 8-11, 2009  -  University of Trento, Trento (ITALY)
*****************************************************************************

&lt;p&gt;Digital libraries, in the central view of the term, focus on storing and organizing digital objects and providing access to  these objects through professional or user-generated metadata or content-based search (full text, image content, full musical  score). In an expanded view, DLs also support annotation, generation or editing of digital objects and provide tools for processing digital objects. The semantic Web focuses on the formal representation of data for more precise retrieval and, more importantly, for reasoning so that many often disparate items of data can be combined to directly answer a user's question or to devise a plan of action. ICDLSW addresses two main questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) How can digital libraries support Semantic Web functionality?&lt;br&gt;
(2) How can Semantic Web technology improve digital libraries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the goal is an environment in which all functionality is available to the user without the perception of different systems or system boundaries. Contributions are sought that address one or both of the main questions or steps towards the ultimate system.  Some example topics are listed below, but the purpose of this list is just to stimulate thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPECIFIC TOPICS that address one or both of the main questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Digital objects that provide formal representation of data ready for reasoning, possibly in addition to text, images, or  sound.&lt;br&gt;
* Knowledge acquisition: Editing tools that assist subject experts in the creation of formal representations of data.&lt;br&gt;
* Digital objects that interact with the user or software agents.&lt;br&gt;
* Standards and specifications for digital objects.&lt;br&gt;
* Organization and retrieval of software agents and Semantic Web services.&lt;br&gt;
* Semantic search. Use of ontologies and knowledge bases (such as topic maps) to improve search for digital objects.&lt;br&gt;
* Question answering from text, from data/knowledge bases, or a combination.&lt;br&gt;
* Next generation OPACs.&lt;br&gt;
* The structure and creation of ontologies to support these functions.&lt;br&gt;
* Using the intellectual capital available in traditional KOS such as Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), UDC, or MeSH in the construction of ontologies that support truly semantic search and reasoning.&lt;br&gt;
* Vocabulary and taxonomy development.&lt;br&gt;
* Multilingual issues in Digital Libraries.&lt;br&gt;
* Semantics of bibliographical databases.&lt;br&gt;
* Metadata standards, Interoperability and Crosswalks.&lt;br&gt;
* Digital Library and Semantic Web Projects and Case Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We invite original papers in English on all relevant topics as mentioned above. Papers will be reviewed based on  originality  of work, quality and relevance to the main theme of the conference. Peer reviewed and accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. The papers should follow the SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS provided on the conference website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference will explore the area of digital libraries and the semantic web through tutorials, workshops, demonstrations, invited talks and presentations. The conference will also serve as a working platform for communities to discuss and agree on joint work. We also encourage the submission of workshop proposals for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Paolo Bouquet, University of Trento (Italy)&lt;br&gt;
*Johannes Keizer, FAO of the United Nations (Italy)&lt;br&gt;
*Wolfgan Nejdl, University of Hannover (Germany)&lt;br&gt;
*ARD Prasad, Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore (India)&lt;br&gt;
*Heiko Stoermer, University of Trento (Italy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT DATES:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 16, 2009: Submission (Papers, Posters &amp;amp; Workshops)&lt;br&gt;
June 24, 2009: Camera-ready copy&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That question has an answer: they crouched like birds. A 198 million year old fossil trackway from Utah has preserved a print of a theropod dinosaur taking a break, resting with hands curled inward and knuckle down, and legs bent. Except for the forelimbs, of course, it's very birdlike.&lt;/p&gt;

Restoration of Early Jurassic environment preserved at the SGDS, with the theropod &lt;i&gt;Dilophosaurus wetherilli&lt;/i&gt; in bird-like resting pose, demonstrating the manufacture of SGDS.18.T1 resting trace.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the section of the trace fossil they used to reconstruct the animal's posture.&lt;/p&gt;

B, Schematic of SGDS.18.T1 to scale with A: first resting traces (manus, pes, and ischial callosity) in red, second (shuffling, pes only) traces in gold, final resting traces (pes and ischial callosity) in green, and tail drag marks made as track maker moved off in blue. Note long metatarsal ("heel") impressions on pes prints. C, Direct overhead photograph and D, computerized photogrammetry with 5 mm contour lines of Eubrontes trace SGDS.18.T1. Color banding reflects topography (blue-green = lowest, purple-white = highest); a portion of the berm on which the track maker crouched is discernible.

Just kill it by using this health machine to flood your cells with "Chi" Energy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should read the long, rambling testimonial on that web page — it says absolutely &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; about how this gadget is supposed to "zap disease germs", but it does go through a laundry list of quack therapies, and heaps scorn on other quacks who sell gadgets that cure cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm rather dazzled by the quantity of nonsense all on display there: it's got the New Age + Traditional Chinese Medicine combo of "chi", it's tying it all in to God magic, and of course, it's got the high-tech pseudoscientific dependence on a box with bits of a Radio Shack voltmeter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_woo_it_burns.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yMHbnXCUYbU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236362302612"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5363071536326783542">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8111977d2fd53eb8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Note to Reppert, Plantinga and Craig: The Claimed Proper Basicality of the Christian Set of Beliefs is Utter and Complete Nonsense!</title><published>2009-03-06T20:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T22:31:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/Vc06CQ1Rms0/note-to-reppert-plantinga-and-craig.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5363071536326783542/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5363071536326783542" title="20 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/note-to-reppert-plantinga-and-craig.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">The more I hear about this extremely queer argument the more I'm inclined to think with &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1578849209?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1578849209&amp;amp;adid=1EDBF1FY064GTW2ABJZ2&amp;amp;"&gt;Dr. David Eller&lt;/a&gt; that believing and knowing are two separate things. He argues for a change in our nomenclature even though I'm not yet convinced he's right. It's just that there is no comparison of the Christian set of beliefs with our knowledge that the past happened. By my lights I see the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/icelanders-and-their-culturally.html"&gt;belief in Elves&lt;/a&gt; and the belief in the Christian God as resting on the same foundations--culturally adopted ignorant and delusional beliefs which have no place among intelligent and highly educated scientifically minded people.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that I have been treating Christian beliefs respectfully in the past does not mean I ever thought differently about them or of the people who hold to them. &lt;strong&gt;Christian, you are ignorant.&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry, but that’s what I honestly think. Maybe by my saying this it will make you pause. Just become either an anthropologist, a psychologist, a scientist, a real Biblical scholar, or an archaeologist and it’ll help you appreciate what I’m saying. Yes, there are conservative believers in those fields, I know, but the ratio of conservative believers to liberals and non-believers is much much less in these fields of learning than the general populace (and Biblical scholars started out being conservative). I know why this is so, so you'll have to guess why. Philosophers of religion like Reppert, Plantinga, and Craig are merely accepting the results of shoddy conservative biblical scholarship and then seeking ways to defend those results without being Biblical scholars or archaeologists themselves to know the difference, like Hector Avalos, William Dever, Bart Ehrman are, along with so many others. [Craig is probably best to be thought of as an apologist, not a Biblical scholar]. And anthropology is, well, the clincher, or is it psychology, or paleontology, or geology, or astronomy, or any one of a number of other disciplines of learning?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've learned a great deal while Blogging these few years. Just like flat earthers are ignorant so also are believers. But there's more to it since being ignorant doesn't exactly describe such a person. Believers are blinded by their passions because they have been brainwashed by their culture. Our culturally inherited beliefs are what we use to “see” with. These inherited beliefs are much like our very eyes themselves, so it’s extremely difficult to examine that which we use to see with. We cannot easily pluck out our eyes to look at them since we use our eyes to see. But we must do this if we truly want to examine that which we were taught to believe. It’s a simple fact that brainwashed people do not know they have been brainwashed!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there is no parity with an atheist here, so don't say "you too." For the real debate is NOT WITH ATHEISM AT ALL! The real debate is between the Christianities of the past and today along with the debates between a plethora of Christianities in today’s world. Then this debate kicks into high gear between the myriad of religions themselves. An atheist is someone who simply doesn't think that a particular set of religious claims is correct. I came by my atheism as the result of a process of elimination, as most atheists have done. Christians are on that same road too. They just fail to understand that the same kinds of requirements they demand of other Christianities and of other religions they reject also apply to their own beliefs.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I’ve said before, I think I have &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/fitting-pieces-together-christian.html"&gt;solved the Christian puzzle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-5363071536326783542.gif?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

What elements of the various gospels (canonical and non-canonical) would you select for your portrait, and why do you regard these particular traditions as more likely to be authentic than other traditions that you would choose to omit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Discuss the differences of the views of Jesus as they are presented in &lt;strong&gt;two &lt;/strong&gt;gospels of your choice, for example, the Synoptic Saying Gospel and Matthew, or the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Luke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) David Friedrich Strauss claimed that the gospels depict a mythological Jesus; that is, that they are not trying to represent Jesus “as he actually was”. Using relevant biblical texts, respond to this claim. What sort of evidence might either corroborate or refute this claim? Does such appear evidence in the gospels, and if so, what is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) Choose &lt;strong&gt;one &lt;/strong&gt;Gospel and discuss the redactional method(s) and literary concept of the author that have shaped his/her image of Jesus.

The only interesting argument is whether “not many” in that sentence should be replaced by “no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I stumbled across two invocations of quantum mechanics in very different contexts.  First, via &lt;a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2009/03/un-mauvais-quart-dheure.html"&gt;3quarksdaily&lt;/a&gt;, historian &lt;a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/putting-man-before-descartes/"&gt;John Lukacs&lt;/a&gt; muses on the centrality of our nature as human beings to our ability to apprehend and understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this happened during and after three-quarters of a century when physicists, inventing and dependent on more and more powerful machines, have found more and more smaller and smaller particles of matter, affixing them with all kinds of names. Until now, well into the 21st century, it is (or should be) more and more likely that not only A Basic Theory of Everything but also the smallest Basic Unit of Matter will and can never be found. Why? Because these particles are produced by scientists, human beings themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every piece of matter—just as every number—is endlessly, infinitely divisible because of the human mind. Some scientists will admit this. Others won’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes on like that at great length; it was hard to choose a representative excerpt.  Basically, Lukacs is making a mistake resembling that which I accused &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/11/25/turtles-much-of-the-way-down/"&gt;Paul Davies&lt;/a&gt; of some time back — demanding that properties of as-yet-known physical theories conform to some cherished metaphysical presuppositions.  In reality, the fact that scientists built the apparatuses that produce elementary particles doesn’t tell us anything at all about whether a Theory of Everything is an attainable goal.  It may or may not be, but our status as conscious human beings doesn’t have anything to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, via &lt;a href="http://www.cynical-c.com/?p=12940"&gt;Cynical-C&lt;/a&gt;, we find &lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/03/were_all_puppets_laurie_im_jus.html"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt; reviewing &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/twisted_physics/2009/02/he-watches-the-watchmen.html"&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s ask what we understand about quantum mechanics. We’ll start with me. I understand nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I’ve read a lot about it. Here is what I think I know: At a basic level, the universe is composed of infinitesimal bits, I think they’re called strings, which seem to transcend our ideas about space and time. One of these bits can be in two places at once, or, if two bits are at a distance, can somehow communicate with one another. Now I have just looked it all up in Wikipedia, and find that not only don’t I understand quantum mechanics, I don’t understand the article either. So never mind. Let’s just say my notions are close to the general popular delusions about the subject, and those are what Dr. Manhattan understands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see:  despite the name “quantum,” it’s not really right to think of quantum mechanics as based on individual “bits.”  But it’s true that fields resolve themselves into particles under careful observation, so that’s an excusable confusion.  “Strings” have nothing to do with it, a consequence of mixing up different topics in the pop-science domain.  “Somehow communicate with each other” refers to entanglement — widely-separated entangled particles don’t really communicate, but that’s certainly our fault as scientists and communicators, since we keep saying that they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major differences between Lukacs’s discourse on quantum mechanics and Ebert’s.  First, Lukacs is much more subtle, intricately weaving concepts from modern physics into a thesis concerning the role of history in human affairs.  (Still completely wrong, of course.)  But second and more importantly, Ebert &lt;em&gt;admits&lt;/em&gt; he has no idea what he’s talking about, and goes to look things up on Wikipedia; Lukacs, in contrast, flaunts his misunderstanding, waving it around as proof of his erudition.  Score one for the non-academics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And there’s no justification for scientists sneering at historians in general on this score; if I had a nickel for every time a physicist flung around concepts like “falsifiability” or “postmodernism” without knowing what was going on, I could rescue the American banking system all by myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really found interesting was that Ebert, after giving up on Wikipedia — and rightfully so, their physics articles are uniformly useless for someone approaching the ideas as an outsider — turned next to YouTube for edification!  He includes a few clips that try to say something helpful about quantum mechanics.  I wonder if that’s the wave of the future.  It gave me the idea of making a set of very short videos, each of which would succinctly explain one scientific idea.  Making a two-minute video would take less time than writing a decent blog post.  (Right?)&lt;/p&gt;

Keepon is a simplified robot specialized in nonverbal social behavior, developed for &lt;a href="http://beatbots.org/research/"&gt;interaction with (all) children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keepon takes in some ways the opposite approach of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/considering_visual_processing_in_reading_emotions"&gt;Transporters&lt;/a&gt; (also, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/can_a_dvd_teach_emotions"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)--it reduces and simplifies, removing the alarming complexity of a human face and distilling nonverbal social behaviors down to their most basic level.  Keepon's design deliberately avoids the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"&gt;uncanny valley&lt;/a&gt; problem that made me find Transporters so frightening, which Michalowski discusses specifically in the &lt;a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09061/952629-298.stm"&gt;Post-Gazette article&lt;/a&gt; with his comparison between the greater popularity of cartoony CG over photorealistic CG in movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More fascinating--and exciting--to me though was looking over some of the actual papers published by Kozima on Keepon's interactions with autistic toddlers as the toddlers began engaging in spontaneous social interactions with the robot.  From &lt;a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4415155"&gt;Social interaction facilitated by a minimally-designed robot: Findings from longitudinal therapeutic practices for autistic children&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our major claims are (1) simple robots with minimal and comprehensive expressiveness facilitate the spontaneous exchange of mental states in autistic children, (2) autistic children therefore possess the motivation for this mental exchange, and (3) the major social difficulties that autistic children generally suffer from would rather stem from the difficulty in sifting out socially meaningful information (e.g., attention and emotions) from vast incoming perceptual information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the results of the Keepon study suggest that autistic people aren't lacking the ability to comprehend other minds or without social capacity or motivation as some theories suggest, but are having difficulty making sense of the intensely complex wash of social information found in more human social partners.  This idea is actually completely consistent with my own experience of trying to manage social interactions--in my language, they are always "too bright."&lt;/p&gt;

Her website is www.skepdoc.info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimball Atwood, MD&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Atwood is a practicing anesthesiologist who is also board-certified in internal medicine. He has been interested in pseudoscience for years. He was a member of the Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners, and subsequently wrote its Minority Report opposing licensure for naturopaths. He is an associate editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and co-editor of Naturowatch. He is particularly concerned with implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise, by medical schools and government. He is also dubious about the ethics of human trials of such claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Crislip, MD&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Crislip has been a practicing Infectious Disease specialist in Portland, Oregon since 1990. He is Chief of Infectious Diseases for Legacy Health System.&lt;br&gt;

The article is Elizabeth Landau, "&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/03/06/words.language.pc/"&gt;On Twitter, is it 'he or she' or 'they' or 'ip'?&lt;/a&gt;", and Ms. Landau is worried that English will be unable to reach the epicene ideal, due to fundamental principles of linguistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Consider the sentence &amp;quot;Everyone loves his mother.&amp;quot; The word &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; may be seen as both sexist and inaccurate, but replacing it with &amp;quot;his or her&amp;quot; seems cumbersome, and &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; is grammatically incorrect. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It turns out that an English speaker's mind can't instantly adopt an imposed new gender-neutral system of pronouns, &lt;a href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/Language_and_Linguistics"&gt;linguists&lt;/a&gt; say. A sudden change in the system of pronouns or other auxiliary words in any language is very difficult to achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;She quotes both Steven Pinker and Mark Pagel in support of her concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"The function words form a closed club that resists new members," Harvard University linguist Steven Pinker writes in his book "The Language Instinct."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[…]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"We could time travel and have very limited conversation," said Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, who led the study. "We really believe that we can probably go back 20,000 years with those really, really old words."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact, neither of these eminent scientists has anything to say that should really lead Ms. Landau or her readers to fear that we might be stuck with "his or her mother" for tens of thousands of years into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Language Log is here to reassure Ms. Landau that the problem has already been solved. Singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; is supported not only by the usage of today's youth,  but also by &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002748.html"&gt;historical scholarship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=199"&gt;psychological experimentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=26"&gt;government regulation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003572.html"&gt;divine inspiration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For a more complete discussion of the historical issues (both descriptive and prescriptive), take a look at pp. 51-53, 414-416, 662-664, 666-667, 860, 901-903, of &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As we've often suggested, you should definitely buy either the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Dictionary-English-Usage-Merriam-Webster/dp/0877791325/"&gt;full&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Concise-Dictionary-English-Usage/dp/0877796335/"&gt;concise&lt;/a&gt; version of the just-cited book — the fact that a full scan is now available on Google Books makes it even more useful as a reference, since you can use the search function. And speaking of social media, just consider this review, the first one that MWDEU has gotten on the Google Books site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;My name is……………..&lt;br&gt;
well I can&amp;#39;t tell you cause my friend…(cant tell you her name)&amp;#39;s mom said not to give out personal info on the web. I did&amp;#39;nt read this book but I want&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline" dir="ltr"&gt; to some day. From what i have heard this book is very long, and has a lot of words, AWESOMEly, I want to eat a taco at tacobell so bye,&lt;br&gt;
love&lt;br&gt;
(cant say) i&amp;#39;ll give you a hint it starts with a………………………………………&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; … &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;more »&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more is there to say? ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For another perspective, see &lt;a href="http://benyagoda.com/"&gt;Ben Yagoda&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/19/opinion/oe-yagoda19"&gt;The inevitable epicene solution&lt;/a&gt;", LA Times, 2/19/2007:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;WHAT DOES A tipping point sound like? Possibly, what I heard recently when a leaf of paper fluttered out of a credit card mailing. It offered rewards points for ordering additional cards for family members and had the heading: &amp;quot;No one has to know you added them for the rewards.&amp;quot; The copywriter&amp;#39;s use of the word &amp;quot;them&amp;quot; — instead of the traditional &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; or the more recently favored &amp;quot;him or her&amp;quot; — was the semantic straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back. It was a signal that the genderless pronoun had arrived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; "Returned" might be a better way to put it. Before the mid-18th century, English writers and speakers universally referred back to an indefinite antecedent ("everyone," "anyone," "a person") with the pronouns "they," "their" or "them." This was understandable because all singular personal pronouns are gender specific. And so, Shakespeare: "God send everyone their heart's desire." The King James Bible: "In lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves." Henry Fielding: "Every Body fell a laughing, as how could they help it?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; From the late 1700s through the early 1900s, much grammatical rule making took place in England and the United States, and the rule makers were offended by the use of otherwise plural pronouns to stand in for singular nouns. Their collective wisdom determined that the appropriate pronoun in all such cases should be masculine generic — that is, &amp;quot;he,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;his.&amp;quot; The usage is grammatically unimpeachable but, in excluding females, is not only politically but factually incorrect, leading to the publication of sentences such as, &amp;quot;Man, being a mammal, breast-feeds his young.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what he means by &amp;quot;grammatically unimpeachable&amp;quot; — those of us in the grammatical division of the reality-based community have been impeaching as fast as we can for some time — but I&amp;#39;ll let it go, since according to Ben the tipping point was a little over two years ago in any event. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236356266247"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/06/rep-conyers-wants-science-to-be-secret-or-you-will-pay/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/848dc06bd706e5b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Rep. Conyers wants science to be secret… or you will pay</title><published>2009-03-06T16:09:06Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T16:09:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/06/rep-conyers-wants-science-to-be-secret-or-you-will-pay/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are some things science needs to survive, and to thrive: eager, hardworking scientists; a grasp of reality and a desire to understand it; and an open and clear atmosphere to communicate and discuss results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit there seems to be having a problem. Communication is key to science; without it you are some nerd tinkering in your basement. With it, the world can learn about your work and build on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, government-sponsored agencies like NIH have moved toward open access of scientific findings. That is, the results are published where anyone can see them, and in fact (for the NIH) after 12 months the papers must be publicly accessible. This is, in my opinion (and that of a lot of others, including a pile of Nobel laureates) a good thing. Astronomers, for example, almost always post their papers on &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph"&gt;Astro-ph&lt;/a&gt;, a place where journal-accepted papers can be accessed before they are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Conyers (D-MI) apparently has a problem with this. He is pushing a bill through Congress that will literally ban the open access of these papers, forcing scientists to only publish in journals. This may not sound like a big deal, but journals are very expensive. They can cost a fortune: The Astrophysical Journal costs over $2000/year, and they charge scientists to publish in them! So this bill would force scientists to spend money to publish, and force you to spend money to read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would Conyers do this? Interestingly, &lt;a href="http://www.maplight.org/HR801_2009_Analysis"&gt;if you look at the bill sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, you find that they received twice as much money on average in donations from journal publishers than Congresscritters who don’t sponsor the bill — though to be fair, the total amount is not large. Still, &lt;em&gt;Conyers got 4 times as much&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, this bill is called &lt;a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.801:"&gt;The Fair Copyright in Research Works Act&lt;/a&gt;, which is much like the &lt;del&gt;Clean Air&lt;/del&gt; Clear Skies Act or the Patriot Act, in that it does exactly the opposite of what its name says. This bill is not fair, it puts a burden on scientists and keeps research from being publicly accessible as it should be. I myself rely on things like Astro-ph to do my reporting here; it could become illegal to post papers there for federally-sponsored scientists if this bill is passed.&lt;/p&gt;

First off, it figures that, whenever I go away to a meeting, there's simply an embarrassment of blogging riches. People have been sending me stuff to which, even if I were at home and having a slow week, I could probably never get. Good stuff. Interesting stuff. Unfortunately, I'm now forced either to try to blog about them when I finally get home, which might as well be months later in blog-time, or let them go by uncommented upon, which hurts Orac's mighty ego. Oh, well. My next observation is that I feel a bit queasy taking on this next topic, but it's very important. The reason I feel a bit queasy is because the person writing the piece to which some insolence, both respectful and not-so-respectful, must be applied is almost certainly going to die of leukemia, and I hate to be perceived as kicking a person whose dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, she's an animal rights activist, and she's trying to justify her hypocrisy of having taken treatments for her cancer that had been tested by spreading the same misinformation about animal research that animal rights are known for spreading far and wide. Dying or not, she needs to be called out for spreading falsehoods. Her name is  &lt;a href="http://schaitowitz.blogspot.com/"&gt;Simon Chaitowitz&lt;/a&gt;, and she is the&lt;a href="http://www.activistcash.com/biography.cfm/bid/1496"&gt; former Communications director&lt;/a&gt; for the animal rights group masquerading as a legitimate physicians' group, the &lt;a href="http://www.pcrm.org"&gt;Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/animals_in_research_and_medical_training.php"&gt;crank organization dedicated to eliminating animal research&lt;/a&gt; that has had as one of its luminaries the apologist for animal rights terrorism, Jerry Vlasak. Her article is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-chaitowitz/an-animal-advocate-explai_b_171845.html"&gt;Why I Take Animal-Tested Drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and was posted both to--where else?--&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-chaitowitz/an-animal-advocate-explai_b_171845.html"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/03/05-11"&gt;Common Dreams&lt;/a&gt;. The article is incredibly odious because in essence it argues that she is dying because she took animal-tested drugs, not because she was unfortunate enough to develop breast cancer, then develop complications from the chemotherapy, and then develop leukemia. She is, in essence, arguing that she might not be dying if she hadn't done what she had done, that a cure might have been found for her condition already if scientists didn't use animal models so widely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_hypocrisy_of_animal_rights_activists.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_hypocrisy_of_animal_rights_activists.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/Sr3lyBLjhzQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236353220682"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=495">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ceaa92b6e6773137</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Myths and Misconceptions"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Add new tag"/><category term="Designer Babies"/><title type="html">Designer Baby Hubub</title><published>2009-03-06T15:17:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T15:17:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=495" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We knew it was coming right? It appears that designer babies are around the corner.&lt;br&gt;
In less than a year you will be able to order for your unborn baby insect legs, or antennae, or maybe an elephant’s trunk…wait…sorry…that was for my 2018 blog post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…What I mean is you may soon be able to customize your baby’s eye color, skin, even the curliness of the hair. As you may imagine, this has quickly re-ignited a ruckus with bloggers and commenters comparing this technology to Hitler’s eugenics or a recipe for Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://theness.com/images/blogimages/designerbabies3.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="396"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeff Steinberg is the owner of an LA Fertility Institute. He was one of the team of doctors that created the first process of In Vitro Fertilization, so-called test-tube babies in the 1970s. In this process, eggs are harvested from women, fertilized by sperm and implanted in the womb. I believe there was outrage about that back then wasn’t there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, he says that within 6 months he will offer these designer options to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hold the blogs…this just in….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started putting this post together a couple of day ago, it now &lt;a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/triage/2009/03/designed-baby-proposal-nixed-for-now.html"&gt;seems&lt;/a&gt; that Dr. Steinberg has dropped this whole idea, for now, due to the storm of controversy that arisen over this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Though well intended, we remain sensitive to public perception and feel that any benefit the diagnostic studies may offer are far outweighed by the apparent negative societal impacts involved”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting twist to this is the claim that the science isn’t even ready for prime-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Nobody can do this right now,” &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/03/02/2009-03-02_custommade_babies_delivered_fertility_cl.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sean Tipton of the American Society for Reproductive Technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A statement from the Center for Human Reproduction, a fertility clinic said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The truth is that we cannot (yet) reliably test embryos for eye color, hair color, skin tones and other ‘cosmetic’ features”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steinberg never proclaimed certainty for his blue-eyed deliverables. He always said that the best he could offer was an increased probability of having a child that matches the parent’s checklist. Apparently, he can’t even offer that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how will this process work once they get the kinks out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all possible because of a technique called PGD or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. This has actually been around for 17 years within the In Vitro Fertilization process to screen for genetic diseases. More recently, it’s been used to predict gender with 100% accuracy. It &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=488"&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; by harmlessly taking a redundant cell from a 3 day old fertilized human embryo and performing chromosomal and genetic analysis. Not only does this greatly increase the odds of successful implantation, it also screens the dna of the cell for diseases, like Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs, even for predispositions for certain types of cancer. All told, they search for 90 different mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jamie Grifo, director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at the NYU School of Medicine said the following (before Steinberg withdrew his offer):&lt;br&gt;
“I think this is more hype than reality, Patients don’t do it when they find out what’s involved…You have to go through IVF. It costs a lot of money. It doesn’t always work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IVF process can be quite an ordeal not to mention an expense of around $18,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman commenter described her ordeal like this:&lt;br&gt;
“This is why I question how much a woman would put herself thru to do this.  It is hard to get viable embryos.  It takes 4 weeks of oral medication followed by 3 weeks of daily injections (some of them multiple times per day) followed by 2 1/2 months of intra muscular injections (that are quite painful), to try for ONE baby. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grifo has also said:&lt;br&gt;
“I don’t think patients really want this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to disagree. I think if you had an easy, safe, and inexpensive method for making these selections, many parents would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the opposition I’ve come across seems out of proportion and largely unaware of the facts of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unscientific MSNBC &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29481134/"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; I came across has the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you choose your baby’s physical traits if you could?   * 51442 responses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. It would be great to be able to select hair and eye color!&lt;br&gt;
7.3%&lt;br&gt;
No. It’s not wise to tamper with Mother Nature!&lt;br&gt;
73%&lt;br&gt;
I’m not sure. Screening out physical and mental defects sounds good, but maybe it’s going too far.&lt;br&gt;
20%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through many many comments people left on the MSNBC website. I found a pattern in the responses that I’d like to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL THE SAME&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“all kids will end up being the super awesome and everybody will be the same”&lt;br&gt;
“I do not think it is a good idea, because in the end everyone will look the same, and no one will be unique”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that these people are overstating the impact that cultural fads have on hair and eye color. Wouldn’t there be lots of variations based on the subjective likes and dislikes of the parents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing hair and even eye color is pretty cheap and easy these days. Is this making too many people “the same”? Plus who denies that it won’t be long before we’ll be able to change almost any aspect of our appearance like we change wigs today. How we look when we’re born will become irrelevant to an amazing degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://theness.com/images/blogimages/designerbabies2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="281"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GATTACA SYNDROME&lt;br&gt;
“Once it starts, it will spiral to the point that non-designer babies, kids and finally adults, will be at a significant disadvantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah…the slippery slope argument. The premise here is that only babies can benefit from these genetics advancements.&lt;br&gt;
I think it’s clear that amazing adult enhancement technologies will be ubiquitous in a generation or two. I’m not talking Viagra tech. Like I mentioned above, Superficial changes like hair and eyes and skin will be even easier and cheaper than today. Things like intelligence augmentation through drugs and eventually genetic manipulation could be common-place as well. The same goes for athleticism and fitness. Adults will have methods at their disposal for dramatic improvements far beyond and far safer than steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONFUSION WITH GENETIC MANIPULATION&lt;br&gt;
“To introduce genetically altered human beings to the gene pool can’t be good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are we all so vain &amp;amp; stupid as to start messing with the genetic makeup of our species? Have’nt we created enough new and untreatable strains of viruses, mad cow, AIDS, etc?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people misunderstand this technology. This technique doesn’t manipulate the genome. Blue eyes aren’t being created de novo. It only allows the parents to select among embryos created normally. This technique just removes some of the randomness about reproduction. Is random selection inherently superior? Does it have to be forced on parents if they don’t want it to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…..OK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How our children come out, whether it’s their physical appearance, their gender, or any diseases or defects, is up to God. He is the only one that should have this power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has a purpose.  No one wants to have a child with mental or physical problems, but that child is being born for a specific reason.  It is NOT our job to question or understand what that reason is…only to accept it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel like responding to these. If you agree with these people, nothing I say will make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUST YOU WAIT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not even come close to stopping there. Soon we will hybrid(ize) ourselves with the machines we create…If you are hung up on hair &amp;amp; eye color, you are in for a complete shock in the next 50 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-commentor:Aldus Huxley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this commentor’s sentiment. If you think that this technology is repugnant, then wait until you see the options available to your kids or grandkids. People will be cloning themselves, fusing animal genes into their genomes, integrating themselves with machines plus stuff we’re not even thinking about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the deliciously ironic name this commentor chose…Aldous Huxley. He wrote the famous novel Brave New World many decades ago which anticipates bizarre developments in reproductive technology that change the world turning it into not a utopia but a dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll end with best comment I came across:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Babies are NOT accessories, they DON’T need to color coordinate them.  Geeze…please grow up people, before you create mutants bearing the first zombie disease or something.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236352900444"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4269">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea7dfe52adbd68d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">How My Blu-Ray Paid Off</title><published>2009-03-06T14:57:22Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T14:57:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/HaeOa1zDG3I/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/how-my-blu-ray-paid-off/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I took the plunge and bought a Blu-ray player Monday, on sale at $300 instead of the $600 list.

A lot of the stuff in the video is quite funny (purposely so) and I want to save most of our comedic stylings for the video itself, so this post will be an actual recounting of where we went and what we did. It's part Bigfoot report and part road-trip travelogue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I've said before that "hunting Bigfoot" was little more than an excuse to go on a road trip, see sights, and eat good food. As an excuse, it worked out quite well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We (we being myself and my friend Eib) took off on Friday, February 7th, around 5:30PM. Our first stop was Attica, Indiana, about 40 minutes southwest of Lafayette. By the time we got there, it was dark and we were hungry. We stopped at a little restaurant in Attica called Uncle B's. It's a small place, all one room. No smoking, thankfully. It was a mom-and-pop place (exactly what we were looking for) and it had really good food at really good prices. I got a country fried steak, a bunch of curly fries, a cup of chili, and a pop for something like seven bucks, and it filled me up. Eib wanted breakfast since it was a breakfast-all-day kind of restaurant, and for nine bucks he filled his entire half of the table with eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and pancakes. He got so much I had to help him finish it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The coolest thing that happened at Uncle B's was that our waitress was willing to let us interview her about Bigfoot. I explained our quest, and she said that a friend of hers claimed to have seen Bigfoot around some train tracks north of town, which was exactly where we were headed, which was pretty cool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We left Uncle B's and drove a couple of miles north of town. We pulled off to the side of the road and went across the street to where some train tracks ran parallel to it and climbed up the short embankment to the tracks. It was too dark to see much, and we had forgotten to bring flashlights, so we spent a few minutes staring into the woods across the tracks and listening carefully. We heard nothing, so we moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On our way back through Attica going south, we stopped to fill up on gas and bought a back of Jack Links Beef jerky. We figured that not having the jerky explained why we didn't see Bigfoot at the train tracks. Fully loaded, we continued on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our next stop was along the side of a narrow, winding forest road in the middle of nowhere. This time we went a short distance into the woods and tromped around a bit in the dark, but didn't stray too far from the car. At one point, another car passed and slowed down as if they were going to stop and see if we needed help. I'm glad they didn't. I wouldn't have wanted to have to say to them "Sorry, we don't need help. We're just looking for Bigfoot."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our next stop was very similar to the one before it: a fruitless short hike through pitch-black woods surrounding a winding country road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one after was also like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So was the one after that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A pattern was becoming evident. One thing I realized, though, that first night, is that the pattern was more than "lonely road through the woods." None of these roads were &lt;i&gt;uninhabited&lt;/i&gt;. They were just &lt;i&gt;sparsely&lt;/i&gt; inhabited; a trailer or two here, a bare shack there, even a few houses back in the woods at the end of long driveways. The only light came from passing cars and whatever external lights were on the odd inhabited structures. It was really quite creepy to go wandering through those woods. More to the point, it was kind of creepy just to &lt;i&gt;drive&lt;/i&gt; through them, often with no light but your headlights, most of your view obstructed by trees, never knowing what was going to be around the next curve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I very quickly voiced my understanding of how people could think they'd seen Bigfoot in places like these. In the right frame of mind driving through a place like this in the middle of the night, the wrong shadow moving in a way you wouldn't expect could really freak you out. Likewise, one of the residents of any of the sporadically-placed houses or trailers, were he walking through the woods at night (for whatever reason) could, with a fleeting glance from a creeped-out mind, easily be turned into a lmbering, hairy creature. After all, he'd already be shadowy and hominoid. With a fear or an assumption or two, one could easily think they saw a sasquatch out on those old roads at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really don't think it's a coincidence that most of those sightings &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; happen at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After our fifth stop, we were getting tired and decided it was time to find a place to sleep. We pulled into the outskirts of Terre Haute, Indiana (a place you never want to go; trust me) and pulled into the parking lot of a place called "The Statesman Inn."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you ever &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to go to Terre Haute, for some reason, &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;/i&gt; stay at The Statesman Inn. I was honestly afraid that we were going to be robbed, raped, and murdered, and not necessarily in that order. The place was cheap, but it was worth the price. The office was lined on one wall with fundamentalist evangelical Christian pamphlets, while the opposite wall was hung with pictures of Eastern gurus and shrines to Eastern gurus. The whole office smelled like patchouli oil, so we had a pretty good idea why it took the clerk a while to come out of the back after we rang the bell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The room itself &lt;i&gt;reeked&lt;/i&gt; of cigarettes. It was the kind of years-long, ingrained tobacco stench that you usually only find in the homes of old chainsmokers. The beds were all sorts of busted, the remote control looked like someone had hit it with a blowtorch, and half of the lights didn't work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We both checked under our mattresses for dead hookers. Luckily, none were present. We slept rather uneasily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we woke up, we noticed that their was an enormous bloodstain on the corner of Eib's mattress. Yummy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also discovered that they didn't even leave us little shampoo bottles, just impossible-to-open pouches of Indian herbal shampoo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We checked the hell out of there and almost went across the street to the giant cemetery to look for a ghost or two (why not?) but we didn't want to hop the fence, so instead we just drove down the street to Denny's. It ain't mom-and-pop, but we wanted to get out of The Haute as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did you know that Denny's has a new menu item called the "Grand Slamwich?" It is a fucking Grand Slam on two slices of toast. Seriously. Eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, and cheese piled onto grilled toast with a bit of maple syrup. Eating one was like being touched by God. It was a breakfast revelation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After our Slamwiches were happily in our bellies, we left for one of the longer legs of our journey to McCormick's Creek State Park. We found a really awesome little state park with all sorts of rivers, creeks, nature trails, and campsites. I'm most definitely going back there at some point to camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We stopped in at the nature center and asked the park naturalist on duty if she'd ever heard of Bigfoot inhabiting the park. She laughed and with a wry grin she said "No, I haven't...But if he was anywhere, he'd probably be hanging out at Wolf Cave." That, then, was our next destination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We took the mile-or-so-long trail to Wolf Cave. The park was covered in snow, but it was about 40F outside, so the snow had been melting throughout the morning, leaving most older prints lumpy and indistinct. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after we started on the trail, we saw a footprint that could have, given enough snowmelt, &lt;i&gt;totally&lt;/i&gt; be mistaken for a Bigfoot print. It was a human shoeprint with a dog's footprint serendipitously superimposed right over the toes; it looked at first glance like an extra long, barefoot hominid print. Of course, it wasn't, and we were following shortly behind a couple and their two dogs, but given some melting and blurring around the edges, someone could probably get the wrong impression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly thereafter, we stumbled across a print in the snow that &lt;i&gt;really did&lt;/i&gt; look like that of a large, barefoot hominid. We stopped and goggled for a moment or two. We scratched our heads. Then we realized that whatever the impression was, it couldn't have been an actual bare foot; the "toes" toward the front were far too lightly imposed on the snow, as was the "ball" behind them. Unless Bigfoot walks flat-footed, this wasn't our man. We also noticed that there were only five or six of them, starting at one point in the trail, and stopping at another, while other, regular prints led up to them, moved over and around them, and continued on after them. Bigfoot? Yeah, probably not. Probably some sort of days-old amalgam that had begun to melt and take on a different appearance. All of the impressions were blobby, shapeless, and melted, so we didn't know what they were (though I think a dog-human print is a good candidate), but they probably weren't Bigfoot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We continued to the cave, hung around it for a while, and then took the backside of the trail back to the trailhead (it was a two-mile loop). That section required us to cross a number of creeks only recently made deep with runoff and snowmelt, most of them without bridges. We had to navigate paths of stepping stones, and Eib fell into one of the creeks. It was pretty funny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We left the park and went to Wal-Mart in Spencer, IN (right by the park) so Eib could get new socks and boots and I could pick us up some flashlights. Then we found a little place called (if I remember correctly) Carter's Smorgasbord. It was an amazing all-you-can eat, country, Pennsylvania Dutch style buffet. Everything on it was delicious, from the fresh-baked bread to the two kinds of gravy to the fried chicken. It was only nine dollars. Tasty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there, we made a couple of more stops in the backwoods before getting hopelessly lost and cutting a few sightings out because we had no idea how to get to them and the Google map wasn't helping. While we driving about in rural south-central Indiana, I saw my first-ever barn-roof advertisement encouraging me to "Visit Beautiful Rock City." I've known about Rock City and its idiosyncratic rooftop advertising method for years, but I had never actually seen one of them until then. It was really cool. Made me feel like I was in American Gods for a minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was hoping to see a BurmaShave fence, but one never did turn up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We eventually cause IN-37 and went through Bloomington, IN, on the way down south. We stopped after a while in a little town comprised of a long, winding switchback that went up a rather steep hill. The houses were arrayed almost on terraces up the hill, and at the top were some woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We parked in a small lot in front of a shack with a vending machine in it. Lacking any evidence to the contrary, we decided that the shack with the vending machine in it with a parking lot in front of it was the town's grocery store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behind the grocery store was a steep, woody ravine, into which we descended and found nothing useful. We found an old, weathered basketball there, and decided that it was proof of Bigfoot recreation. After all, he's so tall one would expect him to play basketball.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought popped into my head as we were walking around the ravine, easily in sight of a few houses: we were probably the first outsiders to come through that little town and walk around in quite a while. I wondered what the locals would think: two twenty-somethings drive into town, park at their grocery store, and walk through the woods for twenty minutes before getting back in the car and leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily, nobody shot us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our next stop was, by far, the worst place we drove through all weekend. It was another narrow, winding forest road. This one, though, was heavily populated with all sorts of beaten, weathered, and dilapidated trailers. It was like the epicenter for Indiana's white trash hillbillies. More than one of these trailers had busted-ass cars parked &lt;i&gt;on their porches&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;More than one&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one point we drove through a sort of crazy redneck &lt;i&gt;complex&lt;/i&gt;, a large clearing in which had been built a dumpy trailer and half-a-dozen tumbledown shacks filled with assorted trash, junk, scrap metal, and old car parts. The dilapidated trailer had a wood-burning stove (we could smell the woodsmoke), a broken-down old truck on the porch, &lt;i&gt;and easily a dozen or more busted old trucks all over the ground on either side of the road&lt;/i&gt;. They were all in various states of disrepair, and none of them had their original coat of paint. A couple of them were up on a hill back in the woods and we still have &lt;i&gt;no fucking clue&lt;/i&gt; how they got them there. The whole thing felt like some kind of forest apocalypse compound for a schizophrenic white trash meth addict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, I dubbed that whole area of dumps, trailers, and failures of humanity "The Large Hadron Collider of meth labs;" it was all one humongous, interconnected lab for brewing methamphetamine. Fucking toothless rednecks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spent the next few hours driving south, deep into the Hoosier National Forest. On our way, we kept seeing signs for "Marengo Cave." "Marengo Cave 60 miles this way!" "Marengo cave, just another 40 miles!" We began to wonder if we were unknowingly but inevitably heading for Marengo Cave. At one point, the road came to a Y. In the middle where the road split was another sign for Marengo Cave. A left-pointing arrow said "Marengo Cave, 12 miles this way!" We were going right; we had finally escaped the inexorable pull of Marengo Cave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then we saw that there was also an arrow pointing right: "Marengo Cave 20 miles this way!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which, of course, translates as "You think you can escape Marengo Cave? Fuck you, you can't escape Marengo Cave. All roads lead to Marengo Cave! You will go to Marengo Cave whether you like it or not!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Down in the south of the Hoosier National Forest, after we had somehow successfully escaped the malevolent grasp of Marengo Cave (we eventually decided it wasn't so much a location as a metaphysical ideal; "Marengo Cave" was always "20 miles this way," no matter what way you were going), we pulled off into a field in front of some more woods. By this point it was dark again, so we didn't spend too much time in the woods. Again, we didn't see a damn thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was our last Saturday stop. We drove back up north for a few hours. Eib called his girlfriend and told her that we had caught Bigfoot and tied him to the hood of the car, but that he had escaped when we stopped for gas, so we were chasing him into Louisville, Kentucky. I think she believed him at least for a minute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We pulled of I-65 at one of those random exits with lots of restaurants and hotels and nothing else. Our next stop was a was east from this exit outside a little town called North Vernon, so we decided to head into North Vernon and see what they had to eat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eib, at this point, decided that I had a knack for picking good restaurants, so he let me take the lead. Our choices, as we saw them, were a pub or a cafe. I said pub. We pulled over and walked into a really nice, cozy little bar where the grill had been closed for two hours. The bartender was nice enough to direct us to the cafe we had passed before. It, however, had closed a half-hour before. The owners instead directed us to a place we had missed called "I'm Stuffed." It was a little Italian joint run by a guy who had opened it two years ago after dreaming his whole life to own a restaurant. They served deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was, again, fucking delicious. The pizza was piled with two inches of cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and bacon. It was some really tasty pizza. We completely gorged ourselves; between just the 2 of us, we ate a large deep-dish and an order of garlic breadsticks that were also delicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only cost us ten bucks apiece. I love small town dining!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After dinner, we hopped back on the road and went back to the motel-heavy exit. We had decided that roach motels were out, especially since Motel 6 was only a bit more expensive. We figured it would be better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least partially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was nicer and cleaner, for one thing, and there were no maharishis on the wall, though it was run by and Indian guy. But it was kind of hard to sleep with the constant loud sex going on in the room next to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even worse than that, though, were the drunken rednecks out in the hall in front of our door. Right as I was drifting off, they came out of whatever room they were in and began talking very loudly. One of them was cursing and getting all worked up over something. I got up and went to the peephole to try to gauge how dangerous it might be to ask them to quiet down, and saw three people: one of those skinny, scraggly rednecks in a wifebeater (the loud, cursing one), a hugely, grotesquely fat redneck who pronounced all of his S's with the "sh" sound, and a black guy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I decided that the one was already belligerent enough and it probably would cause more problems than it would solve to ask them to be quiet, so I ignored them. Shortly after I left the peephole, though, the black guy said something, to which the fat redneck replied "Oh, nigger, pleashe."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was very hard not to bust up laughing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it wasn't just that he had said "nigger, please." He had actually said "&lt;i&gt;nigger&lt;/i&gt;, please." Not "nigga, please." He was a huge, dumpy, worthless, white trash piece of shit, and he said, with his dumbass redneck drawl, "Oh, nigger, pleashe." It was completely ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So eventually I fell asleep. The next morning we awoke and ate breakfast/lunch (we woke up late) at a Waffle House (which was kind of complete shit, and the waitress sucked) and then went back through North Vernon to the little park where our next sighting was supposedly located.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hiked around the woods and hills of that park for quite a while, and spent a long time just standing on an old stone bridge over a creek looking out over the forest. It was a really nice day and the park was, well, &lt;i&gt;serene&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No Bigfoot, though. We did see a couple of more suspicious tracks in the snow, but these were even more melted and misshapen than the ones from the day before. They were just large, ovular impressions in the snow that were five to six feet apart from each other. Like the other "tracks," there were only a few of them before they just cut out on either end. My hypothesis was a jumping rabbit from days earlier when the snow wasn't melting. If the rabbit had started running very fast, or gone down the hill, the impression would have changed and that would explain why the tracks just stopped. Eib said he didn't really know what it was, but he was pretty sure it wasn't Bigfoot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From there we went back into North Vernon and parked at the termination of a dead-end road by some train tracks, and walked down the tracks into the woods a ways, as apparently someone had seen a Sasquatch there, too. But no dice for us. Go figure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our next couple of stops were equally uneventful, and for one of them we couldn't even find a place to pull of the road, so we just filmed ourselves driving and talking about how clear it was that Bigfoot, like, totally existed in those woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our final stop was in Blackford County, which, I am told, doubled its teeth count for the short period of time we were there. That sighting happened to a guy who was wandering through the woods shooting at trees. He heard a loud noise and ran.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was wandering through the woods &lt;i&gt;shooting at trees&lt;/i&gt;. Good lord, Indiana is full of worthless shitbuckets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few things we learned on our trip:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Bigfoot plays basketball.&lt;br&gt;- Mom-and-Pop restaurants are awesome.&lt;br&gt;- Terre Haute is worse than we ever thought possible.&lt;br&gt;- Bigfoot is probably a ghost or spirit being (you'll have to wait for the video to find out why).&lt;br&gt;- Southern Indiana is fucking scary.&lt;br&gt;- Someone really wants you to go to Marengo Cave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, it was quite the fun weekend. It made me want to camp at McCormick's Creek State Park, to drive to Attica just to eat at Uncle B's, and to, at some point, have another goofy road-trip paranormal hunting excursion. Anyone in?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-3822891757861513706?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236350327355"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6364">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bf756ff6f8ab9ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 3.6</title><published>2009-03-06T13:45:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T13:45:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6364" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a parent may have figured out what kind of teaching and therapies their child needs at home and in school, there's still the rest of the world to deal with. Grocery stores, shopping malls, libraries, houses of worship, movie theaters, restaurants: Overwhelmed by anything from sensory overload -- noise, smells, sights -- it may be all that an autistic child can do to keep his head down and get through the labyrinthine aisles of the modern American supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this for the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/about/primer?section=primer2"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; section on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/about/primer?section=primer2"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;, as an example of the day-to-day advocacy I've come to know in raising my son Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many a story of "grocery shopping catastrophe survived" exists in the annals of parenthood and certainly in parents raising a child on the spectrum whose need for order and sensory challenges can be seriously compromised amid the fulsomely stocked, fluorescent-light-lit environs of the local Safeway, Schnuck's, or Shop Rite. Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/dont-judge-a-mother-until-you-know-the-whole-story/?hp"&gt;MotherLode&lt;/a&gt; blog in the &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/dont-judge-a-mother-until-you-know-the-whole-story/?hp"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; featured a "tale of two mothers," an account by a blogger/mother/mother of a son on the spectrum in the supermarket line. Mary Jones (a pseudonym) blogs at &lt;a href="http://aroomofmamasown.com/"&gt;A Room of Mama's Own&lt;/a&gt;; in her post on the &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/dont-judge-a-mother-until-you-know-the-whole-story/?hp"&gt;MotherLode&lt;/a&gt; blog she presents two accounts of the same story. The first is a third-person account of Jones's son, Austen, struggling to wait in the checkout line. The second is a first-person account in which Jones discusses Austen's sensory issues and his strong need for routine, and how this supermarket visit was "all in all, it was a very successful trip," whatever bystanders might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a too-familiar scenario and Jones's twice-telling of the same experience, from the perspective of what others see and then of what she herself knew was going on, shows the disconnect between what people--"others," "strangers"---might be thinking when they see an individual on the spectrum seeking to self-calm, and what that individual and those who know her or him well are thinking. I'm reminded of the &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/"&gt;Think Differently&lt;/a&gt;" campaign: Autism's much more than common stereotypes of "Rain Man" and the "idiot savant." When you see a child "misbehaving" in public, it's not that the child is "being bad" and that her or his parent isn't "doing their job"----the child could well be on the spectrum and the parent is doing everything they can possibly think of, and just settling for a hasty retreat to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a child screaming "candy! candy!" and making the shopping cart shake in the grocery store where Charlie and I were last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We passed her, and her mother staunchly pushing the cart (which had a well-bundled baby boy in the front part). My first thought was not about "what" the child might have---she was barely more than a toddler and who knows but in the terrible two's---but the thought, what would I most have appreciated someone did when Charlie had been having a really hard time of it and it seemed that everyone was hurrying past, staring, talking very forcefully on their cell phone, shaking their heads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie unloaded our groceries onto the conveyor belt. "Someone's not happy," said another customer---the mother and her two children were in the next aisle---the clerk sort of smiled and nodded. I handed Charlie the bag of groceries and we walked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother with the two children was just in front of us, her daughter still crying loudly. Charlie was happily hurrying towards the black car and as we passed them, I said words to the effect "you're doing good, you're a good mom." I don't know if those words were heard or if they were appropriate or if I might have just put the proverbial foot in my mouth: So many memories were racing through my head of feeling &lt;em&gt;on the spot&lt;/em&gt; as I tried to calm a crying Charlie and tell the world, there's a reason for this! he's doing his best! he's trying so hard, so very very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocacy empowers and it also can bring us together when, out alone in the big supermarket of the world, we realize someone else isn't judging us. They're rooting for us, they're with us, and they know that we can do it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236322704682"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2430">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88c4b8088283cde6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Birds &amp; Monkeys (or apes)"/><category term="Jerusalem Zoo"/><category term="monkeys"/><title type="html">Monkey Walking Upright</title><published>2009-03-06T06:40:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T06:40:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/monkey-walking-upright/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/monkey-walking-upright/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/8L_SjngmnO8/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Oh yes, you were told, it&amp;#39;s natural to have contrary thoughts, but you must not be deceived by appearances; those things that look like squares are not. They are merely &lt;em&gt;apparent &lt;/em&gt;squares. And in reality, you are politely informed, they not only are circles, they must be, because an all encompassing Theory of Circumfusion requires them to be, and you must believe the Theory of Circumfusion. And what if you did? Despite all that was in you; despite what you instinctively and empirically &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;, what if you believed? &lt;em&gt;What if&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine that you really bought the lie. You began to see reality not as circles and squares, but as circles and the illusion of squares. And suppose over time you trained yourself, through constant reminder that what you see as squares are not squares, but circles; you actually saw only circles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, that would be pretty silly.  We have a very clear &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_%28geometry%29"&gt;definition of a square&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;regular polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with four equal sides and four equal angles (90 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28angle%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;degree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; angles, or right angles)”.&lt;/em&gt;  Anyone claiming a square was a circle could easily be shown to be wrong.  More importantly, a group of independent observers could all pick out the squares from a series of squares and circles, with 100% accuracy, using the standard square definition.  But rbullock doesn’t care about this.  You know where he’s going:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem for Darwinists lies with the term &amp;quot;design&amp;quot;. The term best describes everything we see in nature, but, insist Darwinists, it simply cannot be; The Theory will not allow it. Never mind what your eyes see, never mind what your hands touch, never mind what your ears hear, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, as atheist co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick insists biologist do, constantly remind yourself that what you see was not designed but evolved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is saying living organisms are the (designed) squares that Darwinists are insisting are circles (not designed).  Yes, it’s an &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2007/07/argument-by-ana.html"&gt;argument by analogy&lt;/a&gt;.  Except it doesn’t work because IDists have never been able to define how to tell if something is designed (the way a square is defined), other than “it looks designed”.  What they really mean is “it’s complex”.  But we know complex organisms can evolve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He does have a point though.  Well, almost.  I cringe when people (and I think I’ve heard even Dawkins do this) refer to “design” in nature.  “Design” in my view has to have an element of intent – some conceptualization of the thing before it is built.  Evolution is very clearly how something comes into being &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; pre-planning.  By an accidental mutation that is then (ie after it exists) selected for.  Apparently someone else agrees with me, although rbullock misses the point:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest gift of Darwinian absurdity came in the pages of the gloriously serious-sounding Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research where Columbia University&amp;#39;s W.J. Bock surrendered to an Orwellian coward&amp;#39;s solution: simply eliminate the troublesome &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; word altogether. Rather than have biologists distracted repeating the mantra, &amp;quot;it is not designed, it is not designed, it is not designed,&amp;quot; Bock&amp;#39;s solution is to remove even the &amp;quot;concept of design&amp;quot; from all &amp;quot;biological explanations&amp;quot;. Design is &amp;quot;inappropriate&amp;quot; in biology, according to Bock, and &amp;quot;should not be used in evolutionary theory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I agree with Bock’s suggestion because it is correct.  &amp;quot;Orwellian&amp;quot; is misinformation or the denial of truth – in fact, exactly what rbullock is doing.  Eliminating the “D word” actually makes the description more accurate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Biology can continue to operate (as it does, truth be told) in terms of design, and because there is no English word for &amp;quot;apparently-designed-yet-actually-unintelligently-caused&amp;quot; with respect to observed objects&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes there is.  The word is “evolved”.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adesignists, including Darwinists who believe in God and theistic evolutionists (there is no practical difference) risk embarrassing themselves talking about God for one reason: to keep the confusion alive regarding the Darwin-busting fact of design in nature. Confusion is the ally of a wrong worldview, and those who deny design in biology, particularly for fear of the &amp;quot;connotations&amp;quot; of a designer, must rely on silly thoughts about God and dice as they spin their worldview in a whirlwind of illogic and ever-growing deception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, evolutionists talk about god because they know the IDist’s true motivation is to teach their religious myths as though they were science.  And talking about design that is not there helps them in their dishonest endeavor.  We should stop talking about design in nature.  Evolution is how life got &lt;em&gt;built.&lt;/em&gt;  There is no evidence that there was any forward planning or conceptualization in advance (design) at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236322222177"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/the-life-that-chose-me.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b8abb5faba8abd8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">The Life That Chose Me</title><published>2009-03-06T06:46:06Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T06:46:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/the-life-that-chose-me.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="The Life That Chose Me" href="http://specialed.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Life That Chose Me&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is an eternal dilemma with regards to the law that is largely hidden from parents. The due process that is written into the law to protect parents and serve students often seem to work against each other. The law says we have to serve students but it also says we have to conduct annual reviews and develop IEPs that include the parents and all service providers. The problem is that itinerant service providers frequently have caseloads of 50 - 100 students each or even more. We only have two physical therapists and two adaptive PE teachers that serve all the schools in the county, so they simply can not be so many places at once and at no point are the service providers all in the same place at the same time. So for my students, the IEP might be the only time that the itinerant service providers have a chance to meet and collaborate on a specific student. But if they are there, they aren’t providing services.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236321693502"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2427">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ff9c2ac7f8ae698</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="athvertising"/><category term="Atheist Bus Campaign"/><category term="Seattle"/><category term="Seattle Atheists"/><category term="Thomas Jefferson"/><title type="html">The atheist buses come to Seattle</title><published>2009-03-06T06:30:21Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T06:30:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/05/the-atheist-buses-come-to-seattle/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://seattleatheists.org/"&gt;Seattle Atheists&lt;/a&gt; is preparing to launch an atheist bus ad campaign, which will kick off on April 1st, as in April Fool’s Day.

One was the Senate Panel titled &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;&lt;font color="#585d8b"&gt;Integrative Care: A Pathway to a Healthier Nation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, previously discussed by my fellow bloggers &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;David Gorski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=396"&gt;Peter Lipson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=397"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, and also by the indefatigable Orac (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/dr_dean_ornish_turn_away_from_the_dark_s.php#more"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;); the other was the “&lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/28312/52555.aspx"&gt;Summit on Integrative Medicine and the Health of the Public&lt;/a&gt;“ convened by the Institute of Medicine (&lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/"&gt;IOM&lt;/a&gt;) and paid for by the &lt;a href="http://www.bravewell.org/"&gt;Bravewell Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, previewed six weeks ago by fellow blogger &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=350"&gt;Wally Sampson&lt;/a&gt;. This post will make a few additional comments about those meetings.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 align="left"&gt;Senator Harkin and the Scientific Method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Dr. Lipson, I didn’t have to listen to the Senate Panel video to find out that Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) made this statement of disappointment regarding his own creation, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving. (from &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;last week’s hearings&lt;/a&gt;, time marker approx. 17:20)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are scientists at the NIH really &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2003-09/alternative-medicine.html"&gt;too afraid of Harkin&lt;/a&gt; to explain to him how science works? Apparently so. Otherwise Harkin might learn that his statement is more wrong-headed than it would be for one of us to complain that the Supreme Court ought to assume that a defendant is guilty until proven innocent, rather than the other way around. In scientific inquiry, for those who don’t know, good experimental design is always directed at disproving a hypothesis, even if the investigator is quite pleased with it. The rest of Harkin’s sentiment—”seeking out and approving”—is incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Selling of ‘Integrative Medicine’: Snyderman Trumps Weil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin doctors shilling for ‘integrative medicine,’ which the NCCAM &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/overview.htm#integ"&gt;defines &lt;/a&gt;as “combining treatments from conventional medicine and CAM,” appear to have now decided that subtler language is more likely to sell the product. We’ve previously seen an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=68"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; offered by ‘integrative’ Mad Man Andrew Weil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of proven CAM to conventional medicine would be an improvement, yet this combination alone is not what could be defined as integrative medicine….Integrative medicine is defined as healing-oriented medicine that reemphasizes the relationship between patient and physician, and integrates the best of complementary and alternative medicine with the best of conventional medicine. We believe that this synthesis of humanistic medicine, patient- and relationship-centered care, preventive health, allopathy, and CAM is the model for creating an improved system of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes someone who knows his way around a faculty meeting much better than does &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html"&gt;ex-hippy&lt;/a&gt; Weil, however, to know that the surest way to usher ‘integrative medicine’ into the curricula of medical schools is to press the delete button whenever the pesky ‘CAM’ term comes up, and to replace it with a few trendy slogans that everyone can agree on. Ralph Snyderman, MD, the former Chancellor for Health Affairs at Duke University, is just such a person. As far back as 2002, Snyderman &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12228074?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrative medicine is an approach to the practice of health care based on a sound scientific approach with an emphasis on the responsibility of the physician to engage the patient in his or her own unique plan for health. Essential aspects include the recognition of the importance of the mind-body relationship and a willingness to consider unconventional modalities with informed skepticism and scientific evaluation. Above all, integrative medicine encompasses the caring bond between the patient and the caregiver, and the responsibility of the latter to enable the patient to benefit from a full array of modalities that can be shown to benefit health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprise, then, that Snyderman was a key figure in last week’s “Summit.” Here is how he &lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/28312/52555/62260.aspx"&gt;introduced &lt;/a&gt;the topic prior to the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we currently have is not a health care system, but a disease care system,” said Ralph Snyderman, M.D., chair of the Summit Planning Committee and chancellor emeritus of Duke University. “The summit will explore how science and a patient-centered, prospective, integrated approach to care can make a positive difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that ‘integrative medicine’ now might have something to do with preventive medicine, ‘patient-centered care,’ and fixing the health care system. The Summit’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/File.aspx?ID=63183"&gt;Issue Background&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by professional writer &lt;a href="http://newassociatesllc.com/who_we_are.htm"&gt;Vicki Weisfeld&lt;/a&gt;, makes it official:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrative medicine orients the health care process to create a seamless engagement by patients and caregivers in the full range factors known to be effective and necessary for the achievement of optimal health over the course of one’s life. In integrative medicine, patients are active partners in their health and providers care for them as individuals in different life circumstances, rather than just treating their illnesses. Thus, integrative medicine takes into account biological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of individuals’ lives, draws the best evidence for their needs and circumstances, and engages both treatment and prevention, including diet, exercise, stress management, emotional wellbeing, and socio-environmental factors. Integrative medicine makes use of the best conventional care and the latest advances in predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine and uses all appropriate evidence-based prevention, treatment and supportive approaches. Finally, it asks physicians to serve as guides, role models, and mentors and to recall that “healing is always possible, even when &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=376"&gt;curing is not&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widespread implementation of an integrative medicine approach would fundamentally transform our nation’s current fragmented, inefficient, expensive, and reactive “sick care” system to one that is more proactive, personal, efficient, and appropriately focused on enhancing the health of each person and the population as a whole. Five chronic conditions—mood disorders, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and high blood pressure—now account for more than half of all U.S. health expenditures. The onset and serious consequences of these conditions may have been partly or wholly preventable. Current patterns of care do little to enhance health, prevent illness, or treat it efficiently and effectively when it occurs. The reimbursement system encourages this pattern, by financially rewarding units of service, rather than outcomes, prevention, and the integration of care processes that each patient should expect. Little encouragement, through incentives or care patterns, is offered to individuals to take active part in their own care to enhance wellness and minimize disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. No ‘CAM’ mentioned there. Nor will you find it at all until the bottom of page 3, where it is dressed up as “proven complementary approaches,” without further comment. You don’t see it again until p. 9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some elements of an integrated approach to health care also have their roots in practices that began under the rubric of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The effectiveness of such approaches has been strengthened as experience and evidence has [sic] been gained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aha, you’re thinking: we’re about to find out what those mysterious, “proven complementary approaches” are! Think again, because here is the rest of the paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003-2004, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine sponsored a series of grants to strengthen awareness and knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine practices among medical students. The goal was to broaden the array of evidence-based techniques that physicians have at their disposal. A common finding from these projects was that culture change, including faculty development, was a necessary accompaniment to curriculum changes, and the result is a growing presence of relevant courses in the nursing and medical curricula. Expansion of these trends will require additional research, resources, incentives, continuing education courses, licensure requirements, and, perhaps, ultimately, reimbursement incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that ‘experience and evidence’ have shown that the only way to foist implausible medical claims into medical and nursing school curricula is to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;dupe medical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080701113116.htm"&gt;nursing students&lt;/a&gt;, bribe faculty members, and twist some arms. Or, perhaps, to pretend that ‘integrative medicine’ does not involve prescribing non-existent drugs, manipulating non-existent ‘energy fields’ and non-existent ‘rhythms,’ balancing non-existent ‘qi’ in various non-existent organs through non-existent ‘meridians’ and non-existent ‘acupuncture points,’ correcting non-existent ’subluxations,’ diagnosing and treating diseases by examining non-existent homunculi on ears, eyes, and feet, hosing non-existent toxins out of colons, and all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much easier it must be, when faced with a profession that has become maddeningly wedded to science—that vexing “reductionist perspective”—to pretend that one’s pet project doesn’t include such anti-scientific drivel (well, maybe it includes a little of the socially acceptable sort: “from the use of mindfulness meditation, acupuncture, massage and biofeedback, to nutritional practices and dietary supplements” is all you get in this essay). Instead, why not claim that the program is about ‘patient-centered care,’ prevention, improving access to care, improving reimbursement for primary care physicians, making health care less expensive, considering psycho-social aspects of patient care, improving communication skills among health care professionals, and other uncontroversial topics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if these have long been recognized as worthy goals, both individually and in the aggregate, since well before ‘integrative medicine’ or ‘CAM’ began to contaminate rational discourse in medical schools and government? So what if ‘integrative medicine’ has nothing new to add to these topics? This is all of little concern to the savvy chairman, who knows that the most important determinant of smooth sailing at a meeting is to avoid saying anything that might wake up the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is ‘Integrative Medicine’ Preventive Medicine?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does ‘integrative medicine’ have anything to add to the topic of preventing diseases? You’d sure think so if you’d awakened from a 40-year coma last week to read the &lt;em&gt;Issue&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since integrative medicine begins from the perspective of maintaining and promoting individual health, it is necessarily closely attuned to the array of behavioral and environmental factors that put health at risk. Inevitably, the health system must look beyond the individual patient to broader social and environmental influences. As mentioned, many environmental factors require public health advocacy and intervention. However, even individual behavior, such as smoking and exercise, is susceptible to social and environmental approaches. Widespread anti-smoking advocacy and supportive public policies, like anti-smoking rules in workplaces and public spaces, increased tobacco taxes, and consumer education programs have changed the environment in the United States from a pro-smoking to largely anti-smoking culture. Similarly, public policies that promote exercise by building bike, jogging, and walking trails, corporations and city planners that encourage office and residential buildings to include gyms and showers, and an array of other public policies support a health-promotion culture. Health professionals have credibility in public discussions of such policies and can do a great deal for their own patients and the community by endorsing such pro-health initiatives. Medical researchers and health policy analysts can develop the clinical research and public policy assessments on which sound public policies can be based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, now. That such spin was apparently composed with a straight face can only be a measure of how few people will read it. Which, alas, is exactly what the Bravewell crowd has in mind, and why Snyderman is such a brilliant choice as Propaganda Chief. The prevention hype is everywhere; here’s Harkin again, this time from his &lt;a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c"&gt;written statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need a paradigm shift that places a much greater emphasis on preventing disease and keeping people healthy rather than merely treating people once they become sick. Integrative care can help us achieve this goal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But has ‘integrative medicine’ or any of its ‘CAM’ progenitors contributed anything to &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; preventive medicine, as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=400"&gt;introduced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; by Peter Lipson? Has any of the preventive measures that most physicians can think of right off the bat—oh, in no particular order, by no means comprehensive, and not without uncertainties about usefulness or best uses: immunizations, blood pressure measurement and treatment, cholesterol screening and treatment, mammography, occult blood in stool, colonoscopy, smoking, folate and iron in pregnancy, other prenatal care, bone density, weight, diet, exercise, pap smears, skin exams for melanoma, prostate-specific antigen, and many more—been introduced by ‘integrative medicine’? Let’s look. First, a list of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, 2008&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;The Guide to Clinical Preventive Services includes U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening, counseling, and preventive medication topics and includes clinical considerations for each topic. This new pocket guide provides general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, pediatricians, nurses, and nurse practitioners with an authoritative source for making decisions about preventive services.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rape victim was only 9 years old!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And typical evil bastards that they are, the Catholic Church had the audacity to object to allowing the abortion procedure when no one in their right minds would consider a 9-year-old capable of raising a child and this child didn’t even have a uterus big enough to hold 1 fetus, let alone 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She is very small. Her uterus doesn’t have the ability to hold one, let alone two children,” Maia told the Jornal do Brasil newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in Brazil where abortion is illegal, judges are given the right to make exceptions. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .if the mother’s life is in danger or the fetus has no chance of survival.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Has he considered the possibility that he’s surrounded himself by Yes Men and that his book, which I’m not surprisingly told is just a rehash of his earlier books, just isn’t very good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. His book explicitly defames atheists. Did he honestly think he had a shot at getting positive ratings from atheists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. He wrote a book that addresses controversial ideas, something that everyone can agree on regardless of whether they agree with him or not. Every other author who writes a controversial book manages to deal with bad reviews from those who disagree with their ideas. It’s not a conspiracy; it’s just the marketplace of ideas.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Vatican cardinal said Tuesday that the Catholic Church does not stand in the way of scientific realities like evolution, though he described as “absurd” the atheist notion that evolution proves there is no God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this in perspective, this was the statement made by Cardinal William Levada, a man whose title is head of the Vatican’s Congregation for the &lt;strong&gt;Doctrine of the Faith&lt;/strong&gt;. What does he think isn’t absurd?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that however creation has come about and evolved, ultimately God is the creator of all things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how he supposes God got here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 February 2009 three Polish scientists, led by professor ŁukaszA. Turski, initiated an open protest letter to the Polish Minister of Labour against the official list of jobs and professions recently published on the &lt;a href="http://www.praca.gov.pl/index.php?page=klasyfikacja_zawodow"&gt;web pages of Labour Offices&lt;/a&gt;. The protest concerns the fact that among professions such as engineer, scientist, teacher or physician in the list there are also "professions" such as: astrologer, dowser, fortune-teller, healer (here called "bioenergotherapist") or reflexologist. The list not only records the professions names but in a detailed way describes their nature and job tasks. For instance the record concerning a fortune-teller says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;*** Name: Fortune-teller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Code: 514903&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Synthesis: Consciously using inborn abilities for dealing in the field of supernatural phenomena the fortune-teller insights into the future and past events by way of different forms of traditional fortune-telling such as: cards (especially tarot), kaballah, I-ching (according to ancient Chinese "Book of transformations"), chiromancy (fortune-telling from hand), catoptromancy and crystalomancy (foretelling the future based on mirror or crystal) etc.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236314647229"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1455">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7e4c0c7e9ecb099</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor/ Fun Stuff"/><category term="Rants"/><category term="Teaching/Tutoring"/><title type="html">Don’t scream.</title><published>2009-03-06T04:43:39Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T04:43:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/03/06/dont-scream/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">It’s only Thursday.  Screaming isn’t allowed until Friday afternoon after all the students have left.  (Please don’t scare the custodians, without whom we would all be in dire straits.)

It was interesting but disturbing.  Let me elaborate a bit; when I start to listen to these lectures, I'm rarely aware if the speaker is normal, crazy, skeptical, or a fucking nutbag.  Once the talk is about twenty minutes in, the listener can usually judge, but with Scheuer, it was a bit more difficult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is very knowledgeable about the world and about international affairs.  His mindset is reminiscent of John Bolton, another well-versed yet rather over-the-top personality.  I found myself nodding along when listening about how the United States should stay out of foreign wars, but disagreeing adamantly with his hard-hearted, America-centered view of humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example: during the Q&amp;amp;A, Scheuer was asked about his &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t go anywhere to help/fight unless there are American interests.  He mentioned Afghanistan:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If it's in our interest to be involved, as it was in Afghanistan, we should have been, and we should have left the message in Afghanistan with whatever it took in terms of body count and smoldering buildings - 'don't screw with the Americans'."&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also said that the coalition was holding American back from "winning" there.  Here's the quote:&lt;blockquote&gt;What going to Afghanistan with an alliance did was to limit the amount of savagery we could apply&lt;/blockquote&gt;He's big on leaving giant holes in countries, in case you didn't pick up on that.  Also, in case the "stay out unless we can get something" attitude wasn't obvious, here's what he said about the humanitarian crisis in Darfur:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are places that really doesn't matter what happens.  Darfur is the perfect example of that.  If it bothers your conscience, then everyone's free to go be an NGO or join a convent or whatever you want to do...I don't think it's a commitment to cost American lives to sort out a civil war in the Sudan."&lt;/blockquote&gt;I remember when the Rwanda genocide happened in 1994 thinking, &lt;i&gt;"Why the fuck don't governments go there and stop that?  They're fighting with machetes and clubs, for chrissake, it's not like it would take a ton of troops/peacekeepers to achieve a cease-killing."&lt;/i&gt;  At the time, however, I was naive about our nature and about the political systems of the "first" world.  No one cared.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a great line in &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395169/"&gt;Hotel Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; where Paul Rusesabagina thanks Jack for shooting some horrible footage, and the reply is, &lt;i&gt;"I think if people see this footage, they'll say Oh, my God, that's horrible. And then they'll go on eating their dinners. "&lt;/i&gt;  Likely more to the point is another from that same movie where the UN colonel Oliver explains why no one is going to help them: &lt;i&gt;"You're black. You're not even a nigger. You're an African."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The truth in that hits pretty close to the bullseye - or the back of a Tutsi skull, depending on the metaphor you'd like to use.  It is what Scheuer seems to have in the back of his mind. There's nothing in Sudan for the United States, therefore why help?  By that logic, if he and his family are walking down a street and on the other side, in an alley, he sees a woman being raped and beaten, he would not intervene in any way because, hell, what's she got that he needs?  Fuck her (quite literally, in this case), and off we go to the movies!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, Mr. Scheuer, some of us like to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror in the morning and we would also like to think that our leaders would help when genocide is happening.  It is understandable to have the "let's clean up our yard first before helping someone else" mentality, but the yard in North American countries is fucking spotless compared to both Rwanda and the Sudan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea that other countries engaging in wars should be essentially spectator sports is understandable to a certain degree, but where diplomacy can be used, it should be and that extends to becoming a mediator for countries who either hate each other so much that they can't wrap their heads around negotiating, or who, if they had a war, would upset a regional peace that would effect trade and international relationships on a grand scale.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I have to comment on Scheuer's quote about the tentativeness in Afghanistan.  He was upset about Colin Powell's assertion that it was:&lt;blockquote&gt;...more important to keep the coalition together than to protect America by winning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I hear that phrase all the time, "winning", and he used it after the above quote about "limiting the savagery" as well.  What does it mean to "win" the War on Terror?  We're so used to thinking of war as nation against nation, coalition of nations against rival coalition of nations, but that's not what this is.  This is a coalition "of the willing" against a scattered group of religious joined-yet-separate factions.  Thinking in terms of "nation-war" in this case will only serve to drive so many previously uninvolved and on-our-side Afghanis and Iraqis into the waiting arms of &lt;i&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/i&gt;.  There is not too much that would make suicide-bomber recruiters happier than a ton of "smoldering buildings" in an Afghan or Iraqi suburban area.  I don't understand the fascination with destruction some of these guys have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm tired and going to bed now.  Apologies for the heaviness of this post.

Thanks for dropping by.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government of Illinois, an an obvious attempt to distract America from Blagojevich’s hair, &lt;a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/96/SR/PDF/09600SR0046lv.pdf"&gt;has declared that Pluto is a planet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESOLVED, BY THE SENATE OF THE NINETY-SIXTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that as Pluto passes overhead through Illinois’ night skies, that it be reestablished with full planetary status, and that March 13, 2009 be declared “Pluto Day” in the State of Illinois in honor of the date its discovery was announced in 1930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank heavens — so to speak — Pluto doesn’t pass over any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; states. That could propagate a Constitutional crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would drive the government of a state to go out of its way to do such a ridiculous thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of the planet Pluto, was born on a farm near the Illinois community of Streator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, right, misplaced local pride. They obviously didn’t planet that way. They should have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(moon)"&gt;nixed&lt;/a&gt; the whole idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But OK then, surely they wouldn’t say anything &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; that brazenly dumb in the resolution, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS, Dr. Tombaugh is so far the only Illinoisan and only American to ever discover a planet; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, Illinois legislators. Psssst! &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debra_Fischer"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Marcy"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; hundreds &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Paul_Butler"&gt;of planets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their confusion is obvious; they thought they were doling out justice, but they got confused because Pluto is just ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s OK though, Illinois congresscritters. I’m sure there’s nothing else for you to do with all your spare time. But y’know, I hear those pesky Hoosiers next door want to make π equal to 3! Hurry! You can still beat them to it!&lt;/p&gt;

Egnor objected that the Society is acting unethically because “&lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; Americans are creationists,” and for the Society to take a stand against creationism is a “demand for censorship.” Worse yet, their decision is a slap in the face of American taxpayers whose tax money funds so much scientific research. It’s hypocritical, he says, for scientists to take government funding while opposing the teaching of “creationism” (his word) in government schools. PZ Myers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/michael_egnor_pounds_his_shoe.php" rel="external "&gt;responded to this at his blog,&lt;/a&gt; and now Egnor has &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/03/pz_myers_americans_are_an_igno.html" rel="external "&gt;posted a reaction&lt;/a&gt; at the DI’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two points here that really must be made.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 52ND OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representative strongly opposes the invitation to speak on the campus of the University of Oklahoma to Richard Dawkins of Oxford University, whose published statements on the theory of evolution and opinion about those who do not believe in the theory are contrary and offensive to the views and opinions of most citizens of Oklahoma.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
THAT the Oklahoma House of Representatives encourages the University of Oklahoma to engage in an open, dignified, and fair discussion of the Darwinian theory of evolution and all other scientific theories which is the approach that a public institution should be engaged in and which represents the desire and interest of the citizens of Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow. This from the same crowd that gets all fluttery and happy at &amp;quot;academic freedom&amp;quot; bills — they want to kick Richard Dawkins out of the whole state.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BACHMANN: If you want to look at economic history over the last 100 years. I call it punctuated equilibrium. If you look at FDR, LBJ, and Barack Obama, this is really the final leap to socialism. ... But we all know that we could turn this around and we can turn this around fairly quickly. We're still a free country.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And as the Democrats are about to institutionalize cartels -- that's what they're very good at -- they're trying to consolidate power, so we need to do everything we can to thwart them at every turn to make sure that they aren't able to, for all time, secure a power base that for all time can never be defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She calls what punctuated equilibrium? I don't think she knows what it means, and I don't believe she knows anything about either biology or economic history. It's interesting to see the Republican version of bipartisanship so nakedly exposed, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, I have a bumper sticker on my car that says, "Honk if you understand punctuated equilibrium!" No one ever honks.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/michele_bachmann_minnesotas_gi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Hu-V88xzsfo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236297741259"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/exterminate.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/436a51f0159804d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">So that's what happened to that Dalek!</title><published>2009-03-05T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/JZIZOH19NQE/exterminate.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/exterminate.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Damn, wouldn't it have been cool to have been the guy who found this? A &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2289396.ece?OTC-RSS&amp;amp;ATTR=News"&gt;Dalek, lost from Doctor Who since the 1970s or 1980s&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Workers were baffled how the Dr Who relic ended up there, but it may have been in the murky water for more than 30 years after being dumped during location filming in the '70s.

&lt;p&gt;Marc Oakland, 42, who made the discovery, said: "I'd just shifted a tree branch with my foot when I noticed something dark and round slowly coming up to the surface. I got the shock of my life when a Dalek head bobbed up in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was covered in mould and weed, and had quite a bit of damage. One of the dome lights was smashed, but the eye-stalk was intact."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the Dalek -- famous for its Exterminate threat -- was made near Beaulieu, Hants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Doctor Jon Pertwee made a number of episodes on location in the county during the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC also took Daleks there for filming in the 1980s when Colin Baker was Timelord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, they're keeping the exact location secret, to prevent a horde of Who fans descending upon it to look for more Daleks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/exterminate.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/JZIZOH19NQE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236297656726"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_the_nihnimh_stimulus_funding_re_autism">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c20b6ecfc500764</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">More on the NIH/NIMH Stimulus Funding re.

So here are just the bits she didn't already touch on--please reference her post for more / other areas in which autism is mentioned or could be a topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Bioethics!  Yes, please!  These get at a number of topics that are very important--what are the ethical issues relating to discoveries about the nature of autism?  How can autistic research participants be better represented in research about them?  What are the issues involved in autism registries (a topic I'll return to soon)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique Ethical Issues Posed by Emerging Technologies. Advances in biotechnology and biomedical science raise novel ethical, legal, and social issues. Research in this area is needed to understand the unique ethical concerns related to emerging technologies (e.g., biotechnology, tissue engineering, nanomedicine, and synthetic biology). These include issues such as dual use research, privacy, safety, intellectual property, commercialization and conflict of interest, among others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical Issues in Health Disparities and Access to Participation in Research. Research is needed to assess the under-representation in biomedical and clinical research of U.S. minority populations, underserved populations, and populations who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, to identify barriers to participation in research and to develop approaches for overcoming them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethical Issues Associated with Electronic Sharing of Health Information. The development of an electronic health information infrastructure and the sharing of health information for patient care and research offer enormous promise to improve health care and promote scientific advances. However, the broad sharing of such data raises numerous ethical issues that may benefit from additional studies (e.g., those related to privacy and confidentiality).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;	Ethical Issues in the Translation of Genetic Knowledge to Clinical Practice. Genetics and genomics have great promise for the development of personalized medicine, yet the ethical, legal and social implications of both the research and application of genetic and genomic knowledge and technology are far reaching. Studies are needed to better understand the factors that influence the translation of genetic information to improved human health and the associated ethical issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Participation, mentoring, and inclusion--"individuals with disabilities" to hopefully include individuals on the spectrum.  Would this include how to teach researchers the value of working with those they currently consider merely "test subjects?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Models for national mentoring networks for individuals from diverse backgrounds. Develop and pilot innovative models for national mentoring networks for individuals from diverse backgrounds (individual from under-represented racial and ethnic groups, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and individuals with disabilities) with interest in mental health research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these areas, and those Kristina listed, compare to what you feel are research priorities?  Does this sound good or not so much?  Which areas of those listed do you feel are the most important?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236297154559"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-6752227687494268366">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b38c722dd25f4763</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DNA barcoding" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Scitable (and a weird piece on DNA barcoding).</title><published>2009-03-05T22:47:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-06T00:06:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/cfDcns5OEF8/scitable-and-weird-piece-on-dna.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=6752227687494268366" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/scitable-and-weird-piece-on-dna.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">I received an email about &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable"&gt;Scitable&lt;/a&gt;, a new online resource by Nature Education.  I notice that they have a link to my 2005 &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v6/n9/abs/nrg1674.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Nature Reviews Genetics&lt;/span&gt;.  Overall, I think the site looks interesting.  On a more curious note, I was checking out the material about comparative genomics, and came across this, um, bizarre discussion of DNA barcoding:&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Excerpt from &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Genomes-of-Other-Organisms-DNA-Barcoding-and-662"&gt;Genomes of Other Organisms: DNA Barcoding and Metagenomics&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Partial Gene Sequences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method of &lt;span&gt;comparative genomics&lt;/span&gt; can be applied not just to full &lt;span&gt;genome&lt;/span&gt; sequences, but also to single genes and &lt;span&gt;gene&lt;/span&gt; fragments to study their &lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; and help establish relationships among &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt;. Indeed, a &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt;' place on an evolutionary tree is a valuable predictor of the structure and &lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; of neighboring taxa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The current convention of describing (defining) organisms new to science and establishing their evolutionary relationships is based on total evidence; in other words, the organisms' genetic, morphological, and ecological characters are described and analyzed against other sets of data. Taken together, these techniques can be very informative, having thus far provided us with a detailed road map of Earth's biota. But for systematics - the study of biological diversity and common ancestry - rapid technological advances in the field of &lt;span&gt;comparative genomics&lt;/span&gt; are both a blessing and a curse. Consider, for example, the technique called &lt;span&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; bar coding, which is based on using short fragments of mitochondrial &lt;span&gt;gene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;CO1&lt;/em&gt; to uniquely identify and document animal &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; (Savolainen, 2005). This technique has applications across all living organisms, but the precise genetic methodology is still being developed. In addition, the debate among scientists regarding the use and the utility of &lt;span&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; bar coding has been quite vociferous. On one hand, this technique brings the promise of instant &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; identification to a much wider community with minimal biological training. Indeed, it is hypothetically possible to carry a hand-held device out in the field and input &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; sequences into a rapidly expanding database; all for a fraction of the price, knowledge, and effort associated with the conventional manual method or with human-curated taxonomic identification. So what's the catch?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One major problem with &lt;span&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; bar coding is that it operates on the assumption that &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; have evolved in perfect percentile distances of genetic diversion. Thus, with this technique, in order for any two organisms to be deemed the same &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt;, they must share 88-98% of &lt;span&gt;genetic code&lt;/span&gt; at the chosen &lt;em&gt;CO1&lt;/em&gt; mitochondrial &lt;span&gt;gene&lt;/span&gt; fragment (Savolainen, 2005). The exact suggested threshold has to be characterized for each group, and neither the threshold nor the groups have been clearly defined for most taxa. Thus, &lt;span&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; bar coding has been called a "quick fix" and an oversimplification of systematics. Indeed, wide variation in the &lt;em&gt;CO1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;gene&lt;/span&gt; is found not only among &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt;, but also within them, and even between the cells of an individual &lt;span&gt;organism&lt;/span&gt; - a phenomenon known as mitochondrial &lt;span&gt;heteroplasmy&lt;/span&gt; (Kmiec &amp;amp; Woloszynska, 2006). Furthermore, there is a broad overlap of inter- and intraspecific genetic distances among closely related &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; (Goldstein &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2000). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These issues come into focus when you consider the devastating malaria epidemic that kills one to three million people worldwide every year. The pathogens that cause malaria are protozoan parasites from the genus &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; that are transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes of the genus &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt;. Both of these animal genera contain hundreds of &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt;, although only a few are involved in transmitting malaria in humans. Recent genetic studies of the symbiotic &lt;span&gt;bacteria&lt;/span&gt; in the midgut of the &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes have yielded promising results: &lt;em&gt;Enterobacter agglomerans&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;bacteria&lt;/span&gt; were genetically engineered to display two anti-&lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; effector molecules that kill the parasite before it is transmitted to humans (Riehle &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;, 2007). Now consider the genetic and physiological differences between the &lt;span&gt;wild-type&lt;/span&gt; and genetically modified &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes: they are still the same &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; by all major standards of &lt;span&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; definition, yet what a difference it would make for humankind if the &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium-&lt;/em&gt;resistant genetically modified &lt;span&gt;strain&lt;/span&gt; were &lt;span&gt;dominant&lt;/span&gt;. This example highlights the importance of studying genomes and biological associations of the narrowest niches of life. It also underlines the vital potential for the unpredictable outcomes of &lt;span&gt;genome&lt;/span&gt; sequencing-major advances are often made using information generated for completely unrelated reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok.  The last paragraph has nothing to do with DNA barcoding.  As to the critique of DNA barcodes, I find it odd that the author a) does not cite any papers by people who do DNA barcoding, and b) cites a paper from 2000 (i.e., 3 years before DNA barcoding began) as showing that sequences overlap.  Nevermind that the paper a) does not discuss COI data, and b) is co-authored by Rob DeSalle and Alfried Vogler (my two postdoc advisors), neither of whom is against the use of DNA in species identifications (though both would prefer cladistic methodology).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bias is obvious, but at least they could have included some proper references (goodness knows there are enough vocal opponents).&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-6752227687494268366?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/cfDcns5OEF8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236294438913"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7381530169147230204">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d65a83039af2e2f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="University" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science Education" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Depth vs Breadth</title><published>2009-03-05T22:38:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T23:06:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/depth-vs-breadth.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7381530169147230204/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7381530169147230204" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> A University of Virginia press release announces ...A recent study reports that high school students who study fewer science topics, but study them in greater depth, have an advantage in college science classes over their peers who study more topics and spend less time on each.I have no idea if the results are reliable but it does highlight an issue that needs to be addressed.

At least $200 million going to the &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; is to be spent on a "new initiative,"  the "NIH Challenge Grants in Health and Science Research."   Descriptions of these challenge grants under &lt;a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov"&gt;NIMH&lt;/a&gt; can be seen &lt;a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/recovery/recovery-act-nih-challenge-grants-nimh-areas.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 15 priority research areas are listed that "focus on specific knowledge gaps, scientific opportunities, new technologies, data generation, or research methods that would benefit from an influx of funds to quickly advance the area in significant ways." Several either mention autism directly, or autism-related research. Notably, some grants specifically mention services and the delivery of services (also noted on &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1938"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An asterisk (*) indicates the "highest priority topics."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04-MH-101*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Autism: Addressing the challenge&lt;/em&gt;. Target research gap areas identified by the &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IACC) Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Disorder Research, including biomarkers, novel interventions, and new tools for screening, among other topics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04-MH-104&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Access to services by individuals with autism and their families&lt;/em&gt;. Engage well-characterized subjects and families in existing autism research activities in preliminary studies exploring variations in access to and use of services, identification of targets for services interventions, and exploration of how variations in service use affect family functioning in diverse populations. Contact: Denise M. Juliano-Bult, M.S.W. 301-443-3364, djuliano@mail.nih.gov&lt;em&gt;[About time there's been focused mention of research on the delivery of services.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05-MH-101*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Leveraging Existing Healthcare Networks for Comparative Effectiveness Research on Mental Disorders and Autism&lt;/em&gt;. Existing large integrated healthcare networks are needed to more efficiently conduct large-scale effectiveness trials in “real-world” patient settings. The NIMH solicits individual or collaborative, linked grant applications from researchers with experience conducting studies within large integrated healthcare delivery systems to develop and test infrastructure to efficiently conduct trials on the effectiveness of treatment, preventive and services interventions to improve care for people with mental disorders and autism. Applicants can propose studies to 1) demonstrate the ability to identify, recruit and enroll large patient populations into clinical trials, 2) harmonize electronic medical record data across multiple integrated systems for research use, 3) pool data for common analyses, and 4) build capacity for the collection and storage of biologic material.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05-MH-103*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Collaboration with AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Research Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In FY09 and FY10 the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) plans to support research grants (PA-09-070) on comparative effectiveness of clinical treatments and services as authorized in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) Section 1013. MMA section 1013 mandates two mental health categories: Depression and other mental health disorders; and Developmental delays, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. NIMH is interested in funding ancillary studies including but not limited to: 1) studies on the comparative effectiveness of important new or existing technologies; and 2) assessment of the comparative effectiveness of treatments that are commonly administered to children but have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness in adult populations. Two year studies will contribute to successfully implement the mental disorders components of MMA Section 1013 by utilizing AHRQ networks ( e.g. EPCs, DEcIDE, CERTs, PBRN, ACTION, etc) to generate information for health care decision-making.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05-MH-104*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Building ASD Registries for Use in Comparative Effectiveness Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Given the low base-rate and high variability of phenotypes among people with autism, comparative effectiveness trials of treatments for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) provide significant recruitment challenges to include well-phenotyped samples. Autism registries are needed to more efficiently conduct large-scale effectiveness trials in “real-world” service systems. The NIMH solicits grant applications from researchers with experience in diagnosis of ASD and database registry creation to develop and test infrastructure to efficiently identify populations to include within registries for use in future ASD comparative effectiveness trials. Grants applications to optimize current registries and leverage existing databases are encouraged. Applicants can propose studies to 1) demonstrate the ability to identify and collect relevant clinical, environmental, and genetic data from large populations with autism within multiple service settings, 2) Improve consensus on “caseness” within samples, given variability in phenotypes 3) harmonize data systems across multiple integrated systems serving populations with autism (e.g. health care, special education, Medicaid) for research use, 4) pool data for common analyses, and 5) build capacity for the collection and storage of biologic material.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-MH-101&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Effect of psychotropic medications on neurodevelopment and behavior in animal models&lt;/em&gt;. Examine the effects of commonly prescribed psychotropic medications on neurodevelopment and behavior in juvenile and adolescent animals across significant developmental transitions.  Studies would collect information about the safety of these medications and how they may alter developmental trajectories in fundamental affective, cognitive, and behavioral systems.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;05-MH-102*&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cost Effectiveness of Mental Health Interventions&lt;/em&gt; Information on the cost effectiveness of promising mental health interventions is needed to ensure widespread uptake by payers and health systems. NIMH is interested in adding/extending cost-effectiveness components to randomized controlled trials of treatment, preventive and services interventions through two-year grants. Investigators should prioritize the calculation of the cost/QALY ratio by the most advanced available methodologies to ensure that findings from these projects can contribute to improving the efficiency of mental health care financing. In addition, researchers can conduct analyses of existing databases for systematic cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, benefit/harm analyses or to compare interventions on “real life outcomes” such as level of functioning or acceptability, using meta-analytic methods.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;04-MH-105 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing interventions and service delivery models for the transition to adulthood&lt;/em&gt; Conduct pilot studies to develop and test developmentally appropriate, evidence-based prevention interventions and service delivery models for youth with who are at high risk for, or experiencing severe mental illnesses who are transitioning to adulthood. Studies would propose strategies to address discontinuities in service systems and health care financing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention is usually divided into three types: primary, secondary, and tertiary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.enotes.com/public-health-encyclopedia/primary-prevention"&gt;Primary prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  refers to the prevention of diseases and conditions before their biological onset.  Examples of our most successful primary prevention interventions are clean water/sewerage and, ironically, vaccination.  I say “ironically” of course because so many of the altmed folks who talk about prevention are anti-vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary prevention&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the search for diseases that have not yet progressed to the point of causing overt disease, and intervening to prevent overt disease.  This  includes things like Pap smears, which look for early cervical cancers (which could have been primarily prevented by vaccination), mammography, which looks for early breast tumors,  and colonoscopy, which looks for early colonic neoplasms.  Secondary prevention is sometimes used synonymously with “screening”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tertiary prevention&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the prevention of progression of and complications from existing disease.  For example, retinal and foot exams in diabetics prevent blindness and amputation very effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know quite a bit about prevention.  As I mentioned, vaccination is a very powerful tool of primary prevention.  Let’s take another example, coronary heart disease (CHD).  &lt;a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4704"&gt;We know quite a bit about primary and secondary prevention of this disease&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top two killers of Americans.  For example, quitting smoking drastically reduces a person’s chances of developing CHD.  Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol also drastically reduces the risk of developing CHD.  Physical activity and a lower calorie and lower sodium diet lower the risk of developing CHD, although using it as a sole intervention is not always adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary prevention is another area where science has taught us a lot.  We have excellent data on the benefit of certain drugs and certain blood pressure and cholesterol parameters in preventing progression of CHD.  Statin drugs used to lower cholesterol have &lt;a href="http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/cardiac/statcalc.html"&gt;been shown consistently&lt;/a&gt; to significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular events. We are getting quite good at this type of secondary prevention.  So-called lifestyle changes also play a role, but the size of their effect is likely much less than that of medical intervention.  Still, the two used together can be very effective.   Much of the data on lifestyle modification alone are from very small studies, and the data are not nearly as strong as that for quitting smoking, controlling cholesterol, or controlling blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tertiary prevention has been very successful.  For example, diabetics have a very high rate of lower extremity amputations.  &lt;a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/1/24"&gt;Simple foot care programs can prevent most of these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonsense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative medicine community &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php#more"&gt;gives a lot of lip service&lt;/a&gt; to “lifestyle changes” and prevention, but data from them is very hard to come by.  For example, the &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspstopics.htm"&gt;U.S. Preventative Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; has dozens of evidence-based recommendations on prevention. The National Center for Preventative and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/cancer/"&gt;has a page on cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;, but most of it is about studies that have not yet been done, or interventions that have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of prevention is a science—we can’t just make it up as we go along.  When we give people recommendations on preventing disease, we better know what we’re talking about.  For example, beta-carotenes where thought to have anti-oxidant–and therefore positive–health properties.  It turns out that beta-carotene supplementation may actually increase the risk of some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone talks about prevention, making pretty-sounding promises isn’t enough.  They better make sure they have the data to back it up, or they may end up killing people.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, I am addicted to lip balm; Chapstick to be precise. I carry a tube of SPF 30 Chapstick with me everywhere, and have several back-ups placed strategically in my house, office, car, and gym locker. I re-apply liberally throughout the day, whether I need it or not. I have an irrational fear that I’ll end up with lips so chapped it looks like I have two pieces of blood sausage on my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just can’t quit my Chapstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m not certain yet, but I’ve come to realize lately that I might be addicted to sodas as well. Further research pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After thinking about "laifor" for a brief moment, I had a vague recollection that she had used the same expression many years ago, so she was at least being consistent.  But I still couldn't figure out what she meant by "laifor."  His "wife"?  His "life(r)"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you turn the page and I tell you what &amp;quot;laifor&amp;quot; means, please try to guess.  Mind you, you actually have a bit of context — &amp;quot;the hunter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally (I didn't want to spend more than 15 seconds pondering the semantics of "laifor"), I had to break down and ask her, "Li-ching, what is a 'laifor'?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"'Laifor,' you silly egg!  The thing he shoots with!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was abashed.  Considering that Chinese systematically exchange syllable initial l- for English r- and that rhotacized -fo is a decent Mandarinesque approximation of the impossible (to most Chinese speakers) -fle, "laifor" is a fully understandable Mandarinish representation of "rifle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story's not over yet.  Li-ching went on to say, "In Chinese, we write LAI2FU2 來福 for 'rifle'."  Sensing that I would wonder about the odd choice of characters, which literally mean "come blessings / fortune," she tried to deflect my next question by declaring that LAI2FU2 來福 is a common name for dogs in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately inquired, "But don't Chinese despise dogs?  Why would they call their dogs by such a felicitous name?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes," replied Li-ching, "Chinese people traditionally have treated dogs badly, but they still recognized that dogs could bring them fortune.  It was the same thing with servants; wealthy Chinese treated their servants poorly, but realized they couldn't do without them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereupon, as often happens in such discussions with Li-ching, I went into a linguistic reverie, the gist of which I reproduce in the following paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ah!" I thought.  "Perhaps there's some Freudian (or maybe Jungian) connection between a hunter and his rifle on the one hand and a hunter and his dog on the other hand.  But, no, generally I see LAI2FU2QIANG1 來福槍 ('rifle-spear') in Chinese texts where English 'rifle' is intended.  Odd, isn't it, to call a 'rifle' a 'spear'?  Not really, since the Chinese long ago morphed 槍 ('spear,' with wood radical) into QIANG1 鎗 ('spear,' with metal radical) when they wanted to specify that this was a spear with a substantial component of metal.  Yet they also continued to use 槍 for firearms because, after all, guns have wooden stocks, don't they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm….  What about the alternative sinographic representation of &amp;#39;rifle&amp;#39; as LAI2FU4 來復 (literally, &amp;#39;come-turn [over / around]&amp;#39;)?  Isn&amp;#39;t that clever?!  The English word &amp;#39;rifle&amp;#39; derives from the spiral grooves inside the barrel that send the bullet on a true trajectory, so LAI2FU4 來復 (&amp;#39;come-turn&amp;#39;) is indeed a neat way to express the idea of rifling.  To be more specific when they want to refer to rifling, the Chinese write LAI2FU4XIAN4 來復綫 (&amp;#39;come-turn-thread&amp;#39;).  Yet they still much prefer to write LAI2FU2XIAN4 來福綫 (&amp;#39;come-blessing-thread&amp;#39;).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I awoke from my linguistic daydream and decided it was time to go for a walk with my laifor ("rifle / dog / life[r] / wife / whatever").&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236286054384"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4401710753542440750">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/089470f48f84ac7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Ray Comfort Teaches Us about Evolution and Atheism</title><published>2009-03-05T20:12:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T20:45:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/ray-comfort-teaches-us-about-evolution.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4401710753542440750/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4401710753542440750" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Ray Comfort wrote a book.

&lt;p&gt;A quick reminder: NASA’s &lt;a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/"&gt;Kepler&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft is due to launch Friday night at 10:50 p.m. Eastern time (3:50 UTC). I’ll post again tomorrow as another reminder, and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;I plan on live-tweeting the launch&lt;/a&gt; as well. The launch will be covered on &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kepler will stare at 100,000 stars over a long period of time to look for tiny, periodic dips in their brightnesses, indicating the presence of planets orbiting those stars. With Kepler, we could be on the verge of discovering hundreds of Earth-like planets in the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236279561388"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7773876693025604526">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e54d3afb8f8b303f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">What if God Disappeared?</title><published>2009-10-15T14:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-10-16T12:49:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/clDUjlv5xYg/what-if-god-disappeared.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/7773876693025604526/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=7773876693025604526" title="42 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-if-god-disappeared.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Redated post from 3/5/09.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/pkCuc34hvD4%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7773876693025604526?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

[Check out the blurbs for this book on Amazon!] Believe me when I tell you that this is a masterpiece written to explain to the non-technical reader why scientists accept evolution. It presents many charts that explain the text too. If you as a Christian think the book of &lt;em&gt;Genesis&lt;/em&gt; tells us about creation then you cannot be ignorant any longer, and ignorance is what it is. Get this book and come up to the educated world. After reading it you will then need to reconcile the fact of evolution with what you find in &lt;em&gt;Genesis&lt;/em&gt;, and that prospect is not promising at all.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another newer book deserving of high praise is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Inner-Fish-Journey-3-5-Billion-Year/dp/0307277453/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1236262763&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body&lt;/a&gt;.

AEI, Cato, where are you when we need you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes something like this: A group of companies that chose to put lead in children's toys, or to offshore their operations to countries with poor manufacturing controls in order to save money, are now upset that their schemes are going to cost them money.  The government has the audacity to do something about this crisis, and guess what, it costs the industry money!  Maybe they should have incorporated the costs of lead when they decided to offshore!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Pereira of the Journal &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123621357629835121.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Makers of children's products and charities that run second-hand shops are stuck with more than $1 billion of inventory they can't sell because of a new federal product-safety law, according to surveys by trade groups and the charities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're stuck with this inventory because of a new federal product safety law?  What a way to shift the blame!  If the industry as a whole maintained quality controls, we wouldn't be in a toxic toy crisis, and then the federal safety law would not have been passed.  Consumer protection laws do not just pass out of the blue; they are motivated by serious, overwhelmingly problematic situations.  Trust me on this, there are 100 lobbyists against any consumer protection matter for each advocate in favor of it.  They only pass when agencies and Congress have no option but to side with the single advocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Toy Industry Association estimates that more than $600 million in toys made illegal by the law are sitting in manufacturers' warehouses or have already been shipped to retailers. A trade group for small apparel makers in New York called the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Childrenswear says its members have a $500 million problem. And the California Fashion Association, which represents many Western clothes makers, puts their troubled inventories at $200 million.

&lt;p&gt;The trade groups were reluctant to disclose the names of the companies affected or provide documentation in support of their estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep.  Sounds like they'll be next in line for a bailout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/will_the_lead_toy_industry_get.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/AIva82P5eiQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236278088896"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=490">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/36c4e9d73d65dfa1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><title type="html">Depth or Breadth in Science Education</title><published>2009-03-05T18:26:17Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T18:26:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=490" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=7912"&gt;A new study by Robert Tai&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia compares students who studied broad science topics to those who studied fewer subjects but to greater depth. He found that those who studies few topics to depth performed better in college science classes. This raises some interesting questions for science education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing there seems to be broad agreement on is that we need better science education. Not everyone agrees how to accomplish that goal - whether through better textbooks, better teachers, more multimedia approaches, or more hands-on learning. There is a surfeit of opinions but a scarcity of outcome data. There is some but not enough to squelch the diversity of opinions based largely on ideology and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a personal and professional interest in this question. I am a science teacher at the post-graduate (i.e. medical school) and professional level. I also popularize science through my podcasts, blogs, and lectures. And I am also the father of two daughters (currently aged 9 and 6) and am actively involved in their science education, as well as monitoring their public school science education.  What this means is that I have strong opinions about science education, but also wish them to be better informed by actual evidence. So I always take an interest when these types of studies come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular variable - depth vs breadth - is one I have thought about before. I have always been of two minds on the topic. On the one hand I feel that breadth of scientific knowledge is important. Science as a discipline should all hang together, a property known as consilience. This is because science is exploring the same natural world, so discoveries in one area should at least be compatible with discoveries in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there is insight to be gained by looking across multiple disciplines within science. It enables one to see patterns of knowledge, information, systems, and the ways in which nature works. Taking an interdisciplinary approach to problems is very popular (if rarely practiced) because of the recognition that knowledge from one area may solve a problem from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there are also deep insights to be gained from studying one area to great depth. Depth of knowledge reveals patterns and insights not accessible to the dabbler. There are also general lessons that can be learned from deeply studying almost any topic. These lessons can then be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example many children have a fondness for dinosaurs (as do my daughters, but I have also fostered an equal fondness for birds). By studying dinosaurs or birds in detail they have learned about categorization, attention to detail, and evolutionary principles of nestled hierarchies, diversity and disparity.  They also have learned about how to learn, how to find and access desired information, and the joy of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each approach, therefore, has its strengths and weaknesses. Breadth without depth leads to a superficial understanding of how science works, and such knowledge may not stick. Depth in only a narrow field without breadth gives a parochial view of science, and may also give one a false sense of expertise in all areas of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore my position has been that the best approach is to strike a balance  - learn about all areas of science to a basic level but also delve as deeply as you can go in one or a few areas. It is probably not a coincidence that this is the approach taken in medical education. Medical students learn a little bit of everything, but then specialize in one area, and may in fact subspecialize in a very narrow area. Academics often reduce their focus to a single topic and try to learn everything there is to know about that one very narrow field. In the applied science of medicine, at least, the balance approach has prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find that most career scientists have a keen interest in all of science outside their specialty, and become well-informed lay persons in their spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new study does not really change my opinion on this topic, although it may give me more of an appreciation for the value of in-depth science study at the high school level (as opposed to waiting until college). It makes sense for the reasons I stated above. Learning a little bit of chemistry, biology, and physics in high school may not give sufficient knowledge for it to really stick. And without sufficient depth, real scientific principles may not come across. For example, at the basic level of knowledge you don’t really get an appreciation for the controversies in science and how they are resolved. Only when a topic in given in depth do you get to the limits of knowledge where science really happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that the reason students who took advanced courses in one science did better later on is because teachers capable of teaching the more advanced courses were better science teachers overall. Also, this study is retrospective so there can obviously be self-selection in those students who took advanced courses (although the study tried to control for this). So while this study is provocative, and I do think it reflects a real effect, it is far from being the final word on this question. There are still many variables to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will need to be done is for school systems to implement changes to their curriculum and then measure the outcome of those changes.  Again, this will introduce many variables, but it would be a good real-world test to guide future science curricula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best approach at this time would be to require students to take basic-level courses in the major sciences and then an advanced course in the topic of their choice. Further, the advanced course can require a thesis or other project that would require each student to study a specific topic to even greater depth. This balanced approach is most likely to get the best of both worlds, and also reflects what happens in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach would be to have basic level courses include in-depth study in one subject area - just as an example of the field. So the combined approach can be taken within one course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will point out that I do not think the answer to our science education problems lies solely in any such tweaking of the curriculum. There is no substitute for quality science teachers, and so far that seems to be the dominant variable in the equation. While I think we should continue to monitor and tweak the curriculum, it is not going to be a quick fix. Investing in and demanding higher standards for science teachers is probably going to be the most important measure for improving science education.&lt;/p&gt;

But the day has finally arrived - the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/openlab08/" title=""&gt;third science blogging anthology&lt;/a&gt;, The Open Lab 2008, is now &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823" title=""&gt;up for sale&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year's guest editor, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/UE19877E8/blog" title=""&gt;Jennifer Rohn&lt;/a&gt;, did a fantastic job of putting together the best anthology ever! Thank you, thank you, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer is a pro, so she assembled a team: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog" title=""&gt;Richard Grant&lt;/a&gt; was the assistant editor (yes, the posts were really, professionally edited this year, and thus much improved in the process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/greengabbro/" title=""&gt;Maria Brumm&lt;/a&gt; did the technical part, the typesetting, starting out with the template designed last year by &lt;a href="http://dererumnatura.us/" title=""&gt;Reed Cartwright&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new cover (not depicted here as well as it looks in Real Life) was designed by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/" title=""&gt;Dave Ng&lt;/a&gt;, using the artwork by &lt;a href="http://glendonmellow.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Glendon Mellow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received around &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/the_open_laboaratory_2008_all.php" title=""&gt;830 submissions&lt;/a&gt; (give and take, some doubles, some spam, etc. - we gave up counting in the end) and that amazing pool of blog posts was narrowed down to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/the_open_laboratory_2008_and_t.php" title=""&gt;50 essays, one poem and one cartoon&lt;/a&gt; by a team of judges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/eva/blog" title=""&gt;Eva&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://science.easternblot.net/" title=""&gt;Amsen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://taniaglyde.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Tania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tania_Glyde" title=""&gt;Glyde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog" title=""&gt;Richard Grant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/scurry/blog" title=""&gt;Stephen Curry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://minorrevisions.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/" title=""&gt;Mo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://quernstone.com/" title=""&gt;Jonathan Sanderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/greengabbro/" title=""&gt;Maria Brumm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" title=""&gt;Martin Rundkvist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/" title=""&gt;Cameron Neylon&lt;/a&gt; and, well, Jennifer and me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your post is included in the anthology, or if you were a judge, you may way want to display one of the badges on your website/blog - the codes are under the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have missed them the first time around, you can still buy the &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/631016" title=""&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; anthology and the &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1869828" title=""&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; anthology. Both of those, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823" title=""&gt;the new one&lt;/a&gt;, are available in paperback or as a PDF download at Lulu.com. In a few weeks, the book will also be available at other online retailers, e.g., Amazon.com, but we prefer that you buy from Lulu.com as the proceeds will go towards organizing ScienceOnline'10 next January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we will appreciate if you spread the word about the book - the link to the page where you can buy it is, again, &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to everyone for spreading the word:&lt;/p&gt;

However, there may be other paths to meet those same needs that work too, perhaps even better in some cases, like community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of community in the U.S. these post-modern days is strange--highways dice up neighborhoods, information technology redefines the meaning of location, and "leaving the family" at majority never to cohabitate with the rest of the family again even in old age is the social norm.  But community does yet exist, and community can be the path to survival for many of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film &lt;a href="http://www.lateralfilms.com/keyofg/"&gt;The Key of G&lt;/a&gt; documents one way that community support can look, particularly when the community is defined by shared interests--in this case the arts.  This documentary is one I've always longed to see, because support from an arts-based outsider community is largely how I managed to survive my early adulthood.  From the film's site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE KEY OF G is an award-winning feature documentary about disability, caregiving and interdependence. The film follows Gannet, a charismatic 22-year-old with physical and developmental disabilities, as he leaves his mother's home to share an apartment with a close-knit group of artists and musicians who support him, not only as paid caregivers, but also as friends. Together they create a uniquely successful model of supported living, and a compelling alternative to institutionalized care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different sort of intentional community is the international community &lt;a href="http://www.larche.org/home.en-gb.1.0.index.htm"&gt;L'Arche&lt;/a&gt;, which has been functioning since the early 1960's.  L'Arche's sense of community comes more from shared spirituality.  From the page &lt;a href="http://www.larche.org/a-l-arche-community-is-who-we-are.en-gb.21.0.news.htm"&gt;A L'Arche community is...&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...mutual relationships: At the heart of L'Arche communities are relationships between people with and without intellectual disabilities. A respectful relationship between people who treat each other as of equal value provides security, allowing for growth, personal development and freedom to become more fully the people we want to be. Most importantly, mutual relationships foster the acceptance of each person as a unique and valuable individual, whatever his or her abilities or disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potential criticizm to community support is that without externally imposed standards of quality or state-mandated watch-dog systems, abuse or poor quality of services might be more likely to occur.  But then again, state funded or large institutionally run programs can also be &lt;a href="http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=97"&gt;horrific beyond measure&lt;/a&gt;, so simply having state watch-dogs doesn't necessarily negate the problem.  A community that has true caring for the welfare of its constituents, as well as true inclusion of all constituents in decision making, may be ultimately less prone to those sorts of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Community" may be evolving into new formats in this 21st century world, but it has not vanished all together.  &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/community"&gt;Community by definition&lt;/a&gt; includes the notion of &lt;em&gt;interdependence&lt;/em&gt; in an ecological sense.

It's free to access at the moment.  Turns out megas have even more constrained genomes than microbats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has long been recognized that bats and birds contain less DNA in their genomes than their non-flying relatives. It has been suggested that this relates to the high metabolic demands of powered flight, a notion that is supported by the fact that pterosaurs also appear to have exhibited small genomes. Given the long-standing interest in this question, it is surprising that almost no data have been presented regarding genome size diversity among megabats (family Pteropodidae). The present study provides genome size estimates for 43 species of megabats in an effort to fill this gap and to test the hypothesis that all bats, and not just microbats, possess small genomes. Intriguingly, megabats appear to be even more constrained in terms of genome size than the members of other bat families.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-9167984242632753894?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/BV1UPwyX2fg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236275055472"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-1791187585042016408">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d3a19a32262b4366</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Genome size" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">With genomes, bigger may really be better...</title><published>2009-03-05T12:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T12:42:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/oEZm30wNJ2E/with-genomes-bigger-may-really-be.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=1791187585042016408" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/with-genomes-bigger-may-really-be.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">...as targets for genome sequencing in order to avoid bias in what we discover about gene regulation from sequenced genomes, because so far only small genomes have been sequenced.

I have been meaning to write a paper on why we need large-scale genome size surveys and why sequencing people should be enthusiastic about it (maybe even help fund it).  Here is another great reason that I will cite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It so happens that a student in my lab will soon be initiating a project on dipteran genome sizes -- this gives it even broader significance.  I might point out that tephritids do not have "big genomes" for insects by my reckoning (for that, you would need to get beyond holometabolous orders).

The conference is July 9–12, and is sure to be a good time since so many fun people will be mashed all in together, including James Randi, Phil Plait, Adam Savage, Harriet Hall, and Jennifer Ouellette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, we’ll be throwing a Skepchick party. Previously, we’ve booked larger and larger suites in an attempt to meet demand. This year, we’ve taken it to the next logical step – we’ve rented a villa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, a &lt;em&gt;villa&lt;/em&gt;. There is a pool, a hot tub, a theater, and enough room for people to spread out and enjoy themselves without annoying the neighbors. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in a residential neighborhood, so we’re going to be stricter about who is invited and who gets to hang around (for instance, if you’re annoying us and/or causing trouble, we will kick you out like the cold, cold bitches we are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, this year there is a guest list. To get on it, all you have to do is &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/skepchickvilla"&gt;read this evite&lt;/a&gt; and RSVP with your full name and that of any guests. Your name won’t be visible to anyone but us, and we’ll need it to make sure you’re not a crazy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party will be Saturday night. The day before, we’ll email the exact location of the villa to everyone on the evite list and include info on how you can maybe catch a ride on our courtesy shuttle van. The villa is a few miles from the hotel, which is only a couple of bucks for a cab if you miss the van. We ask that those of you who do receive the address not share it with anyone but the guest(s) you bring. It’s important to us that we keep the crowd manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said he's sure his book sales have been affected because of the negative reviews, "because people purchase upon other people's opinions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has he considered that the book might just be awful? No, apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he said, the book can't be too bad.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
Comfort said the strong opposition easily is explained.
&lt;p&gt;
"I simply expose atheistic evolution for the unscientific fairy tale that it is, and I do it with common logic. I ask questions about where the female came from for each species. Every male dog, cat, horse, elephant, giraffe, fish and bird had to have coincidentally evolved with a female alongside it (over billions of years) with fully evolved compatible reproductive parts and a desire to mate, otherwise the species couldn't keep going. Evolution has no explanation for the female for every species in creation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know Ray is rather stupid, but who knew he could be that stupid. This has been explained to him multiple times: evolution does explain this stuff trivially. Populations evolve, not individuals, and male and female elephants evolved from populations of pre-elephants that contained males and females. Species do not arise from single new mutant males that then have to find a corresponding mutant female — they arise by the diffusion of variation through a whole population, male and female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than  a conspiracy of atheists falsely downrating his book, there is a simpler explanation for his lousy sales: it's a piece of crap written by an incompetent and idiot, and his complaint just confirms that he doesn't know what he's talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/its_a_conspiracy_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/1NqSdQ3JMvg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236273120793"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/05/open-lab-2008/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/972d2a5a53bde3ac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Open Lab 2008</title><published>2009-03-05T17:00:11Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T17:00:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/05/open-lab-2008/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is a collection of 52 essays representing some of the best science blog writing from 2008. It includes essays from a lot of the usual suspects, plus others I bet you don’t know. My own post about WR 104, a potential nearby gamma-ray burst progenitor, is in there too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823"&gt;Open Lab 2008 is on sale at Lulu.com for $15.50&lt;/a&gt;, or you can download a PDF for $7.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have both Open Labs 2006 and 2007, and they are wonderful book full of good science, skepticism, anti-antiscience, and just plain old good stuff. I really recommend getting a copy.

You can now read his description of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/03/dawkins_in_minneapolis.php"&gt;social events around Dawkins' visit&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/03/dawkins_on_purpose.php"&gt;much more thorough account of the talk itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other point that I should emphasize. This talk presented an overview of how we should look at the appearance of design in the universe, for a general public. While I heard some complaints that there was nothing new in it, that's the way this had to be: it was a &lt;i&gt;synthesis&lt;/i&gt; of a position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins is often given a rap as one of those ultradarwinians who see every detail of life as the explicit product of carefully honed selection. For me, what was interesting in this talk was how clearly he repudiated that position. In several places, he contrasted what he called a "naive Darwinist" perspective with reality, and showed that the strawman didn't hold up. A major point was also that features that may very well have evolved with a core that was selected for can have side-effects, and been subverted to non-adaptive purposes, and that these features may represent a significant element of the species' character. He talked quite a bit about the flexibility of the human brain, a property that was the product of selection, yet that same flexibility means it can be reprogrammed into deleterious byways, such as religion or fanaticism or unthinking patriotism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all stuff that I agreed with, and didn't surprise me at all. Similarly, &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; didn't contain anything radical or new. The virtue of these kinds of talks and books is that they pull many commonly held ideas together into a coherent fusion that can be more readily absorbed by a larger number of people who haven't yet taken in all of the underlying evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/greg_laden_has_a_big_advantage.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XSy-zUG7Sq4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236271413911"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/wild_night_on_the_town_for_a_g.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f965bbb06ab0d2fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Local"/><title type="html">Wild night on the town for a godless nerd</title><published>2009-03-05T13:01:24Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T13:01:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/eznpwmAYeSk/wild_night_on_the_town_for_a_g.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/wild_night_on_the_town_for_a_g.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I may be getting too old for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I finished up teaching at 1 in the afternoon, then had to leap into the Pharyngulamobile and drive, drive, drive to Minneapolis. I got together with &lt;a href="http://fellmanstudio.com"&gt;Lynn Fellman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; for a hasty dinner before I had to go move my car and park prior to Richard Dawkins&amp;#39; talk. This was almost a disaster; it turns out that last night, at the same time as the talk, there was a basketball game scheduled. The streets were packed, parking was a nightmare, and I only got to Northrop Auditorium with a whisker of time to spare. Many of the attendees seem to have run into the same problem, as I noticed that people were dribbling in well into the middle of the talk. (No, not dribbling large orange balls…dribbling as in trickling, and looking a little stressed from the struggle to get into the parking garages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I introduced Dawkins almost on time, though. I got applauded, even though I only spent less than a minute talking — or maybe because I spent less than a minute talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins&amp;#39; talk was good. He&amp;#39;s trying to make a strong distinction with a word that&amp;#39;s already greatly overloaded in the English language: &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot;. His point was clear, that we really can mean a lot of very different things when we describe the purpose of something, and that especially when we&amp;#39;re talking about biology, &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; does not imply &amp;quot;designed with intent&amp;quot;. One excellent example of the way &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; is abused was shown: Ray Comfort&amp;#39;s infamous banana rationalization. It made the bit even more hilarious to see after Dawkins had warned us of the habit of too many people to use &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; too freely to imply intent — Comfort was the perfect bad example. I&amp;#39;m a bit dubious that Dawkins&amp;#39; word coinages — &amp;quot;archi-purpose&amp;quot; for describing the function of an evolved structure, like a bird&amp;#39;s wings, and &amp;quot;neo-purpose&amp;quot; for novelties produced as a consequence of prior innovations, and which are often subverted to undermine a Darwinian function — but that&amp;#39;s always the problem with attempts to introduce new terms. Language is a slippery beast that will twist beneath your efforts to tame it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins did do a book-signing afterwards, at which a huge crowd appeared. I was very impressed at the man&amp;#39;s well-practiced signing technique — he got through everyone quickly, and he didn&amp;#39;t seem to suffer the slightest crippling of the wrist for his trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then had a pub night, at the Campus Club in Coffman Memorial Union. As you know, we'd kept it a bit mum so we wouldn't be overwhelmed by a swarm descending on the place, but just by word of mouth we had well over a hundred people in attendance. Richard got his beer, I had non-alcoholic stuff (no fun, but I had a long drive ahead of me), and there was a buffet of good food that vanished amazingly fast. All thanks to Rick Schauer who set up and hosted the event! We had more mobs of people swarming Richard and getting photos taken with him; look for them to bloom all over Facebook today. It was a good opportunity to make a more informal acquaintance with the famous Dr Dawkins than the usual lecture followed by departure, so if you didn't get the super-semi-secret directions to the party, you missed out on a splendid evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up and left about 11pm. I know, the night was still young! Alas, I had a three hour drive home ahead of me. I survived it, got home, passed out…briefly. Now I&amp;#39;m up getting ready for my 8am class. Fortunately, it&amp;#39;s student presentations today, so I just have to be awake enough to listen attentively. Have pity on one of my students in that class (Hi, Levi!) who was also in attendance last night, and has to describe frequency shifting in bat calls this morning. It&amp;#39;s good practice for the madcap life of the scientist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&amp;#39;m older than my students. I may just have to drag myself into a dark corner after class and fall into a coma for a few hours in order to recover. I hope you aren&amp;#39;t expecting voluminous posting today…my exhausted brain needs to reboot, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how Dawkins does it. He's just come off of a trip to Michigan, and will be in Oklahoma tomorrow. He is clearly made of tougher stuff than I am.&lt;/p&gt;

I've  seen a number of variations on a very annoying theme, which involves
a very stupid math error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A typical example is this story on ABC news, which contains a non-correction
correction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's tax proposal -- which promises to increase taxes for those families with incomes of $250,000 or more -- has some Americans brainstorming ways to decrease their pay in an attempt to avoid paying higher taxes on every dollar they earn over the quarter million dollar mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 63-year-old attorney based in Lafayette, La., who asked not to be named, told ABCNews.com that she plans to cut back on her business to get her annual income under the quarter million mark should the Obama tax plan be passed by Congress and become law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are going to try to figure out how to make our income $249,999.00," 
she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have to find a way out where we can make just what we need to just under the line so we can benefit from Obama's tax plan," she added. "Why kill yourself working if you're going to give it all away to people who aren't working as hard?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The original version of this article continued to follow this basic theme. The
updated article pretends to correct it, while still basically mantaining the
same focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The idea behind this, and similar stories, is that raising the income tax
rate on people earning over $250,000 per year creates a threshold, where earning
&lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than that threshold will result in your taking home &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt;
after-taxes pay than if you earned less.&lt;/p&gt;

Believe me, it has nothing to do with an sort of false sense of modesty. After four years at this, I know I'm good at blogging. Real good. But good isn't always enough to make much of a difference or even to garner an audience. Whether I've done the first, I don't know. I like to think that I have. As for the second, I've done pretty well for myself. Indeed, after a year of stagnant traffic, January and February were the best months, traffic-wise, in the history of this blog. What that means, I guess, is that sometimes people whom I would never have expected to give a rodent's posterior about what a nobody like me writes actually sometimes take note. Sometimes famous people, certainly far more famous and renowned than your humble pseudonymous blogger, are moved to leave a comment. Not surprisingly, these responses, on the fairly uncommon occasions when they appear, are usually provoked by something I've written that has--shall we say?--displeased the target of my insolence, be it of the respectful or not-so-respectful variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such was the case late Tuesday night, when one of the Four Horsemen of the Woo-pocalypse himself, upon whom I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;had laid a bit of a smackdown&lt;/a&gt; in the course of lambasting Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) for his plan to piggyback the legitimization of quackery onto any health care reform legislation that President Obama might try to get through the Congress. Because Harkin is a very senior and very powerful Senator, one who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;nearly single-handedly birthed the legislation&lt;/a&gt; that produced the Office of Alternative Medicine in the NIH, which later begot the monstrosity that has become the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NCCAM), his intentions are very important, as he very well might succeed if President Obama is insufficiently serious about the promise he made in his Inaugural Address to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/what_is_sciences_rightful_place.php"&gt;restore science to "its rightful place."&lt;/a&gt; A few of you know of whom I speak, as you took up the slack when I couldn't respond right away due to yesterday being a travel day to the &lt;a href="http://www.surgonc.org"&gt;SSO Meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix. I'm referring, of course, to Dr. Dean Ornish, the Founder and President of the &lt;a href="http://www.pmri.org"&gt;Preventative Medicine Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, who left a comment that, because it got held up for moderation (I know not why), I did not see until very late. Suffice it to say, he is not particularly happy with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I can totally understand why Dr. Ornish might not appreciate my criticism, he should actually know that, of the Four Horsemen of the Woo-pocalypse, I consider him (probably) the least objectionable. Certainly he would not be Death (that would be Andrew Weil). Smart-ass that I am, maybe I'll consider Dr. Ornish to be Famine, given that his claim to fame is the use of very low fat diets, along with major lifestyle alterations, to effect changes in health. The reason that I find Dr. Ornish perhaps the least objectionable is that at least he tries to do science. It's preliminary science, and usually the controls aren't the greatest, but it is for the most part science. My main beef with him is how he represents that science to the public. For his claims for dietary treatment of prostate cancer at least he tends to take preliminary studies of highly select patients and make way too much of them. Indeed, he often says one thing in his papers, where peer-reviewers force him to remain tentative and keep him from going too far off into the deep end with his claims, but quite another thing to virtually everyone else, including the aforementioned Senator Harkin and, even worse, to the recent &lt;a href="http://iom.edu/?id=59924"&gt;Institute of Medicine/Bravewell Collaborative conference&lt;/a&gt; on alternative--excuse me "integrative" medicine--from which he hopped over to the Senate to do a two-fer of woo promotion in our nation's capital.&lt;/p&gt;

It comes from the 16 mm Data Acquisition Camera mounted in the lunar module. The camera had multiple settings; it was set to normal speed for this occasion, and was later set to one frame per second to save film for later footage, including Buzz and Neil setting up the American flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JSGMzq6VqwA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=450" width="600" height="450"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see this as I didn’t even know it existed. It gives a different perspective on some of the most famous footage in history! You can see Buzz reflected in the lander window, and even hear Houston telling him how to set camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events shown is fascinating. You can hear Neil say he is opening the MESA, the Modular Equipment Storage Assembly. The movie camera that took the footage of his actual first step on the Moon was in there (some Moon Hoax twinkies love to ask who took the movie of Neil’s step, never bothering to, y’know, look it up. I guess typing stuff into Google is too hard for them). It was aimed at the bottom of the ladder, so Neil would be in its field of view when he walked off the footpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, he takes a hop from the lowest rung down to the footpad. He then hops back up to the last rung, to make sure he can get back off the pad. If he had trouble, he could talk to Houston and work out what to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then observes the surface, noting the dust. He tested it a bit with the toe of his boot to get a better look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, he makes the most momentous step in history, separating us from a planet-bound species to one that strides across worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apollo Lunar Surface Journal &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11stepDACTV.mov"&gt;has a QuickTime clip&lt;/a&gt; that has both the MESA and DAC cameras with the footage synchronized, which is fascinating to watch. You can see when he deploys the MESA, which happens at around the same time he jumps down and back up from the footpad. After that, well, you know the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and geez. Watching it made me choke up again, for real. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236258480739"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1206">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c430f18ad3a9978</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the media"/><title type="html">Brit noun pile heds quizzed</title><published>2009-03-05T12:59:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T12:59:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1206" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fev at &lt;i&gt;Headsup: The Blog&lt;/i&gt; has followed up his post on Britosphere headline culture ("&lt;a href="http://headsuptheblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/hed-noun-pileup-of-morning.html"&gt;Hed noun pileup of the morning&lt;/a&gt;", 2/24/2009), and my comments ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1194"&gt;UK death crash fetish?&lt;/a&gt;", 3/1/2009), with "&lt;a href="http://headsuptheblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/nude-pic-row-vicar-resigns.html"&gt;Nude pic row vicar resigns&lt;/a&gt;", which features great noun strings like "Blast Kelly" (a girl named Kelly involved in an explosion), "George row doc" (a brain surgeon who tried to get the dying George Harrison to sign a guitar), and "Kid porn shame councillor".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes of search in the journalistic Britosphere will turn up dozens of things like &amp;quot;Man guilty of Potter actor murder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Pedestrian death driver jailed&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Canada bus beheading verdict due&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Student fling teacher dodges jail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dancing black hole twins spotted&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Compromise seen on BT broadband build plans&amp;quot;, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fev pointed out, U.S. media seem to do this sort of thing more rarely; and they do it differently. This morning&amp;#39;s New York Times gives us &amp;quot;Afghan Business Empire&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;Health Reform Drive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;War Crime Arrest Order&amp;quot;, and so on. But these seem different — normal English prose might well refer to an &amp;quot;Afghan business empire&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;war crime arrest order&amp;quot;, but not (I think) to a &amp;quot;student fling teacher&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;safari death crash Britons&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a sociological puzzle, a linguistic puzzle, and a historical one.  Is there really a systematic difference between British and U.S. headline culture? Is the difference purely quantitative (more frequent noun compounds) and lexical (particular phrases like "death crash"), or are there constructional ("X row Y" to mean "the Y involved in a scandal over X") and syntactic differences? And when and why did all this start?  (The London broadsheets in 1774 didn't run headlines like "Tea tax row governor replaced".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Let me make it clear that I'm not complaining. I believe that these headlines are usually clear enough to those who are used to them, and who are following the stories they allude to. They don't fill me with &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1204"&gt;disgust&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=45"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;, just curiosity.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236257006352"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/i-want-an-identica-mug-hint-h/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be94ab7876ed39f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">I want an identica mug, hint h…</title><published>2009-03-05T12:06:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T12:06:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/i-want-an-identica-mug-hint-h/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want an identica mug, hint hint @csarven @millette&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236246070309"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0a0d36ead2a7cda</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">What is a Skeptic's Role at a Paranormal Conference?</title><published>2009-03-05T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/464-what-is-a-skeptics-role-at-a-paranormal-conference.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reader (and typo-hound) Dave G. reports the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a huge convention in Minneapolis come November, where thousands of members of the woo-woo fraternity will congregate at The Edge Life Exposition.  In looking at the booth location floor plan, I noticed that booth numbers ending in 13 are absent.  Thus they have #100-112, then 114...; 200-212, then 214, etc, which has caused me to wonder if perhaps those people know something to which the rest of us are not privy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look a &lt;a href="http://edgelife.net/"&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, it does read like the anti-TAM. You can learn how to connect with your angels, discover your inner psychic, and even discover how the secret to happiness is in your mouth – namely through holistic dentistry. Dave continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another anomaly:  The convention is scheduled for two days- Saturday, Nov. 14th, Sunday, the 15th.  However, apparently you can purchase a three-day pass!

Levine: Joe Six Pack Trumps The FDA</title><published>2009-03-05T08:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T08:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=398" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/washington/05scotus.html?_r=1"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; has called today’s US Supreme Court ruling in the Wyeth vs. Levine suit the “most important business case in years.” I have been following this case &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org//?p=279"&gt;for many months&lt;/a&gt;, astonished that a medical malpractice suit had gotten all the way to the Supreme Court. But even more shocking is the fact that the court actually ruled that lay juries may evaluate the accuracy of FDA-approved drug labels written for healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, after a team of FDA regulators decide on the very best language to describe potential risks of a drug -  Joe Six Pack can overrule their expertise and hold the drug company liable for any deficit (as he interprets it) in label language, awarding millions to anyone who experiences harm, no matter how well disclosed that risk is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Wyeth’s attorney, Bert Rein, for comment. Here are the highlights from the interview (a &lt;a href="http://blog.getbetterhealth.com/wyeth-vs-levine-fda-labeling-overuled-by-jury-of-lay-people/2009.03.04"&gt;podcast is available here&lt;/a&gt;)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: The New York Times is calling &lt;em&gt;Wyeth vs. Levine&lt;/em&gt; the most important business case in years. Can you summarize what just happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: The court determined that Wyeth’s liability for Ms. Levine’s injury was not preempted by the FDA-approved drug label warnings. They were not convinced that the FDA had declined to strengthen the warning language on the label prior to Ms. Levine’s injury, though Wyeth had in fact requested a label change. In addition, the court held that the FDA’s regulatory regime was insufficient to preempt Ms. Levine from suing Wyeth, because the FDA doesn’t have a regulational requirement for all label updates to undergo federal approval. The court therefore ruled that the suit was well founded and that the state of Vermont should decide whether or not Wyeth’s conduct was appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: So basically this means that juries can decide whether or not a drug label is sufficiently caveated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: It goes farther than that. Juries don’t have to determine what the label should say, they merely have to decide that the label isn’t “good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: So jurors without any medical background are supposed to determine whether or not a drug label offers physicians sufficient warning about medication risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: Correct. You’re asking lay people not only to make the decision, but to step into the shoes of physicians and say, “Do I think that label is good enough from a physician’s point of view?” By definition, drug labels are not written for lay people, but healthcare professionals. This is asking a lot of lay people, and I think this case is a good illustration of why juries get it wrong. They see an injured person and say “How could the labeling be adequate because somebody’s been hurt?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: What impact will this court ruling have on the pharmaceutical industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: It means that pharmaceutical companies will have to get “clear records” from the FDA on every drug label controversy going forward. This puts a tremendous burden on their already taxed resources. Also if juries can simply say “this drug label is inadequate” then how will the drug company know how to make it better? What drug companies will have to do is forbid the administration of drugs in circumstance that might incur increased risk. That shifts liability to the physician if they administer the drug outside of the prescribed method - and essentially makes the risk benefit decisions on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: So won’t drug companies have to create really long drug inserts to prevent juries from misunderstanding the language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, that’s the direction that labels were going before the FDA tried to reform the system. When drug labels are that long, no one reads them. Then professionals really don’t get educated on the true risks and benefits of the drug. Long labels are not designed for provider education but for law suits. Jury dominance always results in risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: And isn’t this risk aversion going to slow down the drug approval process in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: The industry shies away from developing drugs that have massive liability. That’s why we don’t develop drugs for pregnant women, for example. Any time you unleash a potent liability system, it’s going to factor in to where research dollars are spent. The more the FDA is criticized, the more it tries to protect itself with long drug labels and lengthier reviews - which ends up slowing down the drug approval process and shifting liability to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Val: And phenergan has been safely administered over 200 million times… and so the risk aversion is pretty high, even now with this rather safe drug.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rein&lt;/strong&gt;: Right, it’s not as if the drug is rampantly causing injury. Twenty incidents out of 200 million applications is not a very high risk profile. And the few cases where it caused injury, the drug was administered incorrectly. But if you have an injured person sitting in front of a jury of lay people, it seems as if the logical conclusion is that if the warnings were adequate, this wouldn’t have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take the American Foundation for Justice at its word, their next move is to try to change the law on medical devices so we can go after those as well. The &lt;em&gt;Wyeth vs. Levine&lt;/em&gt; case is good for one industry - the lawsuit industry - and not really anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt; is the name of a DVD created to teach kids on the spectrum how to understand emotions. &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/arc/default.asp"&gt;Autism Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; director Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues developed the DVD with every detail "meant to cater to the autistic mind and teach kids how to understand other people’s emotions," as yesterday's &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/mar/04-can-a-dvd-teach-kids-with-autism-to-understand-emotions/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;amp;-C="&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt; says. Baron-Cohen's theories are behind the creation of the DVD and in particular his theory about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/08/opinion/08baron-cohen.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=Simon%20baron-cohen%20systemize&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;systematizing&lt;/a&gt; being connected to the male brain, and empathizing to the female brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each episode of the DVD is meant to present a certain emotion. The characters are trains and other vehicles, with the faces of actual humans superimposed on them. Notes &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/mar/04-can-a-dvd-teach-kids-with-autism-to-understand-emotions/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;amp;-C="&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt; about Baron-Cohen's theories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All human brains have a need to understand how systems works, a need that is set at different levels for different people. An autistic person, who appears lost in his or her own world, has a brain set to hypersystemizing. As such, children with autism love trains and other single-direction, systematic vehicles and tend to watch them carefully, both in reality and on TV.&lt;br&gt;
Every detail in The Transporters is meant to cater to the autistic mind and teach kids how to understand other people’s emotions. Casting was based on an actor’s ability to produce clear emotional expressions, and a panel of 20 judges, mostly psychologists, was used to evaluate whether each face that appears in the episodes in fact represents the emotion to which it is matched. The eight characters—all vehicles that move slowly and follow predictable, one-way tracks—are animated, but each has a real human face superimposed on it so that any emotions expressed will be “real.” The characters interact with each other in four simple, predictable locations: a junction, a harbor, an observatory, and a quarry. “Past studies show that children with autism like mechanical objects and predictability,” Baron-Cohen says. “Here, we merged the two, keeping everything mechanical and linear—back and forth is the only possible movement, and the only characters are machines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/mar/04-can-a-dvd-teach-kids-with-autism-to-understand-emotions/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;amp;-C="&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt; notes that the DVD was released just over two years ago in the UK and has received an "enthusiastic response"; the DVD was just released in January of 2009 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I've seen it: I've got a copy right here by my computer. The report from my reviewer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phlegmatic, as in, Charlie watched several minutes and then was up and gone. What I'm offering here is not a proper, and certainly not an objective, review of &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt;, but a record of what happened in our household after I put the DVD into my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also qualify this report by noting that Charlie seems to in a minority or subset of individuals on the spectrum in that he has a bit of a "take it or leave it" attitude towards the computer and all things mechanical and technological. He has been extremely into his iPod of late; Charlie's often been drawn to music, and the computer programs and videos and movies that have tended to get his attention are long on the music and short on the story and words end of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Charlie was never very interested in Thomas the Tank Train, which &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt; is clearly modeled on. Charlie did have a train set when he was younger and he was very interested in laying out or (better yet) watching us crawl on the floor and lay out the track. He liked to line up the trains in a (as in, one particular) certain configuration and carefully push all the little trains and locomotives on the track and woe to all when (as they tended to---Charlie's fine motor skills are not what they are now) the trains fell over into a jumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I turned on &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt;, Charlie blinked and looked out the corners of his eyes at it. The backgrounds and trains are computer-generated and, while the faces of the actors on the trains are certainly expressive, the storylines are carefully put together, with the intent of teaching "happy" or "afraid" or "joking," etc.. The DVD is clearly well-thought-out and its elements carefully orchestrated, and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps it's precisely that lack of messiness, of randomness amid all the systematization that made &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt; not a hit in our household (keeping in mind that my son watches very few movies and videos---he's just not very interested).  What are emotions but about that messy, unbounded, often uncontrollable part of our all too human selves? It does make sense to teach these messy entities in a neatly structure setting, but there's a reason that we look to art and music and other creative forms to express and communicate emotions. The exacting scenarios and scripts of &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt; end up, perhaps, undermining its state goal, of teaching children on the to understand emotions which can carry us away when we are least attuned to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying I've a better sense of how to teach about emotions. My own son is very emotional and both senses our emotions and communicates his own in ways other than with words and language. Charlie's completely sensitive to the tone, pitch, volume, and melody of speech and to what is expressed in all that; the snatches of songs that he sings and hums often convey what and how he is feeling. Indeed, one reason &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt; was less effective for Charlie is that the DVD relies so very much on the visual----on the expressions on the actors' faces-on-the-vehicles---to convey emotions, without recourse to body language and gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, we weren't transported by &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com/"&gt;The Transporters&lt;/a&gt;. Onthe other hand----considering how the DVD relies so much on faces to instruct about emotions has gotten me to think about what it does indeed take to teach and tell about feelings---maybe something that's not readily burned onto a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;

I have to say that I don’t think he’s being entirely honest on that claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maglione, 44, acknowledged in interviews with psychiatrists after he was admitted to a hospital 2 1/2 years ago that he was praying as much as 10 hours at a stretch and fasting twice a week, court papers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, Maglione told a medical professional that he had seen a demon at police headquarters, according to a police board medical report dated Dec. 19, 2008, that was included with Maglione’s court papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also says the lieutenant lost 40 pounds in six months by fasting, and urinated on himself because he refused to stop praying to go to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical board report said there are “significant psychological findings precluding the officer from performing the full duties of a New York City police officer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Medical Board believes that the lieutenant cannot be allowed to be in possession of any weapons since he feels subject to God’s will to do what God wants him to do even if he destroys himself,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also says Maglione was given the anti-psychotic drug olanzapine, usually prescribed for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It says he took it once and refused to take it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so as you can see, he’s just being persecuted for his beliefs. . .clearly. Good luck with that one, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s absolutely tragic to see people become so deluded that they passionately fight against their own interests. &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2009/03/books-purpose-driven-wife"&gt;Such is the case with Martha Peace&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t let the name fool you. She’s actually advocating against women’s rights and for all women to return to Pleasantville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to put women in their place and help them understand their priorities. What are those priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those priorities may include rising early to feed the family, being available anytime to satisfy a husband’s desires (barring a few “ungodly” or “homosexual” acts), seeking his approval regarding work, appearance, and leisure, and accepting that he has the “burden” of final say in arguments. After a wife has respectfully appealed her spouse’s decision—a privilege she should not abuse—she must accept his final answer as “God’s will for her at that time,” Peace advises. &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2009/02/i-am-woman-hear-me-cower"&gt;The godly wife&lt;/a&gt; must also suppress selfish desires (for romance, a career, an equitable marriage), practice addressing her spouse in soothing tones, and maintain a private log of bitter thoughts to guide her repentance. “If you disobey your husband,” Peace admonishes in &lt;em&gt;The Excellent Wife&lt;/em&gt;, “you are indirectly shaking your fist at God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s funny that the same day I came across this article, I also saw &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Nn7S9zcFSs"&gt;this tragic video by a Muslim girl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the evil that is religion. Orwell perfectly summed up this form of brainwashing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom Is Slavery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We could perhaps call it the SCTTPKMCT for short. I pointed out once before on Language Log that one of the many versions of its name is the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004109.html"&gt;longest official country name in the world&lt;/a&gt;.  Since I've already identified the general region of the world that I'm in, you should be able to guess it without even clicking that link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island was originally called Formosa, and linguists interested in it as the cradle of the Austronesian language family still talk about Formosan languages.  But &lt;i&gt;Formosa&lt;/i&gt; (a Portuguese word meaning &amp;quot;beautiful&amp;quot; — and while Greenland is in general not green, Formosa really is beautiful) was never a country name.  The Japanese ruled it for some time, but China got it off Japan in 1945.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Nationalist Chinese conceded the mainland of China to the advancing communists and fled to Formosa, they took with them what they regarded as the official and legally recognized government of China (as well as a mass of treasures of Chinese artistic and literary culture, some of which I saw yesterday in the National Palace Museum, guided by a Chinese-speaking Language Log reader, the very generous Randy Alexander), as far as they were concerned the name of their new home was very simple: the Republic of China (ROC).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland (where I woke up yesterday: Hong Kong is just a specially administered region of their country now) regarded Formosa and other nearby islands as constituting a province of the PRC that was temporarily under illegal control — it was occupied by an unrecognized regime that they have chosen thus far not to oust.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the island of Formosa has a Chinese name: Taiwan.  So it became natural to refer to the ROC as Taiwan (in the same way as it is natural to refer to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the name of the island of Great Britain, which is geographically the major part of the space it occupies).  But technically neither Britain nor Taiwan is a country name.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The linguistic situation is complex, but the bottom line is that members of the Chinese language family (mainly Mandarin, Minnan, and Hakka) dominate the island now (to the tuns of 98%), and the aboriginal Austronesian languages are marginalized and highly endangered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical situation is even more complex.  Although ROC is de facto a thriving, modern, capitalist state that is not under the control of the PRC at all, it is PRC policy not to admit that.  And although the growth of the PRC as a major world power and UN voice makes it a bit weird for there to be a prosperous and important country that it refuses to recognize, it is US policy not to admit that, and to treat the ROC as de facto independent, without actually asserting the point in ways that would annoy the PRC.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the real crunch came when ROC wanted to be admitted to the World Trade Organization.  The solution reached was to admit it under a special walking-on-eggshells name: the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu (Chinese Taipei).  This it is not exactly an abbreviation that is going to fit well in a song title for some future Taiwanese Bruce Springsteen ("Born in the S C T T P K M C T") or Lennon and McCartney ("Back in the S C T T P K M C T")  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how shall I express my pleasure at being there when I start the plenary lecture I have to give?  One doesn't want to offend anyone in the region.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine myself clearing my throat, and stammering: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m delighted to be here in… on the island of Formosa… in the Republic of China… in Tai… in the Separate Customs Territory of…&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, I think I may try saying simply: "I'm delighted to be here." You can't go wrong with deictics.  No matter where you go, there you are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

He pretends to get so overwrought on hearing someone saying &lt;i&gt;mis-&lt;b&gt;chiev&lt;/b&gt;-i-ous&lt;/i&gt; on BBC Radio 4 that he shouts at the radio (while temporarily so deranged that he is unable to tell that he was the person shouting), and needs a cup of orange verbena tea to calm him down.  He purports to go to the toilet and retch into the bowl when he hears someone say &lt;i&gt;schedule&lt;/i&gt; with initial [sk-].  It's interesting that he is so linguistically unsophisticated that he doesn't know the difference between what is standard American (as opposed to British) and what is non-standard.  It's the same with his commenters.  It applies both to pronunciations (like &lt;i&gt;schedule&lt;/i&gt; with [sk-]) and spellings (a commenter objects to &lt;i&gt;program&lt;/i&gt;).  The &lt;i&gt;mis-&lt;b&gt;chiev&lt;/b&gt;-i-ous&lt;/i&gt; pronunciation is non-standard (see the &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mischievous"&gt; Merriam-Webster dictionary&lt;/a&gt;).  So is &lt;i&gt;somethink&lt;/i&gt; for "something", which he also objects to.  But that is not the case with &lt;i&gt;schedule&lt;/i&gt; (or the spelling &lt;i&gt;program&lt;/i&gt;).  Tim Footman would have us believe that he experiences actual nausea when listening to someone who does not have &lt;i&gt;shed&lt;/i&gt; as the first syllable of the word &lt;i&gt;schedule&lt;/i&gt;.  He doesn't seem to realize that it's not just an idiosyncrasy of a class of people who don't talk right (which I suppose you could say about &lt;i&gt;mis-&lt;b&gt;chiev&lt;/b&gt;-i-ous&lt;/i&gt;, if you are feeling uppity and intolerant). The [sk-] is standard for American pronunciations of &lt;i&gt;schedule&lt;/i&gt;, and common among Canadians; it's only British speakers who mostly favour the &lt;i&gt;shed&lt;/i&gt; version of that first syllable.  The [sk-] speakers must number in the hundreds of millions.  Tim Footman is going to spend a lot of time on the floor of the bathroom talking to Ralph on the big white phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004679" title=""&gt;Mating First, Mating More: Biological Market Fluctuation in a Wild Prosimian&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In biology, economics, and politics, distributive power is the key for understanding asymmetrical relationships and it can be obtained by force (dominance) or trading (leverage). Whenever males cannot use force, they largely depend on females for breeding opportunities and the balance of power tilts in favour of females. Thus, males are expected not only to compete within their sex-class but also to exchange services with the opposite sex. Does this mating market, described for humans and apes, apply also to prosimians, the most ancestral primate group? To answer the question, we studied a scent-oriented and gregarious lemur, Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka), showing female dominance, promiscuous mating, and seasonal breeding. We collected 57 copulations involving 8 males and 4 females in the wild (Berenty Reserve, South Madagascar), and data (all occurrences) on grooming, aggressions, and marking behaviour. We performed the analyses via exact Spearman and matrix correlations. Male mating priority rank correlated with the frequency of male countermarking over female scents but not with the proportion of fights won by males over females. Thus, males competed in an olfactory tournament more than in an arena of aggressive encounters. The copulation frequency correlated neither with the proportion of fights won by males nor with the frequency of male countermarking on female scents. Male-to-female grooming correlated with female-to-male grooming only during premating. Instead, in the mating period male-to-female grooming correlated with the copulation frequency. In short, the biological market underwent seasonal fluctuations, since males bargained grooming for sex in the mating days and grooming for itself in the premating period. Top scent-releasers gained mating priority (they mated first) and top groomers ensured a higher number of renewed copulations (they mated more). In conclusion, males maximize their reproduction probability by adopting a double tactic and by following market fluctuations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004711" title=""&gt;A Parsimonious Approach to Modeling Animal Movement Data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Animal tracking is a growing field in ecology and previous work has shown that simple speed filtering of tracking data is not sufficient and that improvement of tracking location estimates are possible. To date, this has required methods that are complicated and often time-consuming (state-space models), resulting in limited application of this technique and the potential for analysis errors due to poor understanding of the fundamental framework behind the approach. We describe and test an alternative and intuitive approach consisting of bootstrapping random walks biased by forward particles. The model uses recorded data accuracy estimates, and can assimilate other sources of data such as sea-surface temperature, bathymetry and/or physical boundaries. We tested our model using ARGOS and geolocation tracks of elephant seals that also carried GPS tags in addition to PTTs, enabling true validation. Among pinnipeds, elephant seals are extreme divers that spend little time at the surface, which considerably impact the quality of both ARGOS and light-based geolocation tracks. Despite such low overall quality tracks, our model provided location estimates within 4.0, 5.5 and 12.0 km of true location 50% of the time, and within 9, 10.5 and 20.0 km 90% of the time, for above, equal or below average elephant seal ARGOS track qualities, respectively. With geolocation data, 50% of errors were less than 104.8 km (&amp;lt;0.94°), and 90% were less than 199.8 km (&amp;lt;1.80°). Larger errors were due to lack of sea-surface temperature gradients. In addition we show that our model is flexible enough to solve the obstacle avoidance problem by assimilating high resolution coastline data. This reduced the number of invalid on-land location by almost an order of magnitude. The method is intuitive, flexible and efficient, promising extensive utilization in future research.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004718" title=""&gt;Ant Queen Egg-Marking Signals: Matching Deceptive Laboratory Simplicity with Natural Complexity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Experiments under controlled laboratory conditions can produce decisive evidence for testing biological hypotheses, provided they are representative of the more complex natural conditions. However, whether this requirement is fulfilled is seldom tested explicitly. Here we provide a lab/field comparison to investigate the identity of an egg-marking signal of ant queens. Our study was based on ant workers resolving conflict over male production by destroying each other's eggs, but leaving queen eggs unharmed. For this, the workers need a proximate cue to discriminate between the two egg types. Earlier correlative evidence indicated that, in the ant Pachycondyla inversa, the hydrocarbon 3,11-dimethylheptacosane (3,11-diMeC27) is more abundant on the surface of queen-laid eggs. We first tested the hypothesis that 3,11-diMeC27 functions as a queen egg-marking pheromone using laboratory-maintained colonies. We treated worker-laid eggs with synthetic 3,11-diMeC27 and found that they were significantly more accepted than sham-treated worker-laid eggs. However, we repeated the experiment with freshly collected field colonies and observed no effect of treating worker-laid eggs with 3,11-diMeC27, showing that this compound by itself is not the natural queen egg-marking pheromone. We subsequently investigated the overall differences of entire chemical profiles of eggs, and found that queen-laid eggs in field colonies are more distinct from worker-laid eggs than in lab colonies, have more variation in profiles, and have an excess of longer-chain hydrocarbons. Our results suggest that queen egg-marking signals are significantly affected by transfer to the laboratory, and that this change is possibly connected to reduced queen fertility as predicted by honest signaling theory. This change is reflected in the worker egg policing response under field and laboratory conditions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004680" title=""&gt;Intron Evolution: Testing Hypotheses of Intron Evolution Using the Phylogenomics of Tetraspanins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although large scale informatics studies on introns can be useful in making broad inferences concerning patterns of intron gain and loss, more specific questions about intron evolution at a finer scale can be addressed using a gene family where structure and function are well known. Genome wide surveys of tetraspanins from a broad array of organisms with fully sequenced genomes are an excellent means to understand specifics of intron evolution. Our approach incorporated several new fully sequenced genomes that cover the major lineages of the animal kingdom as well as plants, protists and fungi. The analysis of exon/intron gene structure in such an evolutionary broad set of genomes allowed us to identify ancestral intron structure in tetraspanins throughout the eukaryotic tree of life. We performed a phylogenomic analysis of the intron/exon structure of the tetraspanin protein family. In addition, to the already characterized tetraspanin introns numbered 1 through 6 found in animals, three additional ancient, phase 0 introns we call 4a, 4b and 4c were found. These three novel introns in combination with the ancestral introns 1 to 6, define three basic tetraspanin gene structures which have been conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Our phylogenomic approach also allows the estimation of the time at which the introns of the 33 human tetraspanin paralogs appeared, which in many cases coincides with the concomitant acquisition of new introns. On the other hand, we observed that new introns (introns other than 1-6, 4a, b and c) were not randomly inserted into the tetraspanin gene structure. The region of tetraspanin genes corresponding to the small extracellular loop (SEL) accounts for only 10.5% of the total sequence length but had 46% of the new animal intron insertions. Our results indicate that tests of intron evolution are strengthened by the phylogenomic approach with specific gene families like tetraspanins. These tests add to our understanding of genomic innovation coupled to major evolutionary divergence events, functional constraints and the timing of the appearance of evolutionary novelty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004677" title=""&gt;Insect-Specific microRNA Involved in the Development of the Silkworm Bombyx mori&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding genes that participate in post-transcription regulation by either degrading mRNA or blocking its translation. It is considered to be very important in regulating insect development and metamorphosis. We conducted a large-scale screening for miRNA genes in the silkworm Bombyx mori using sequence-by-synthesis (SBS) deep sequencing of mixed RNAs from egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. Of 2,227,930 SBS tags, 1,144,485 ranged from 17 to 25 nt, corresponding to 256,604 unique tags. Among these non-redundant tags, 95,184 were matched to the silkworm genome. We identified 3,750 miRNA candidate genes using a computational pipeline combining RNAfold and TripletSVM algorithms. We confirmed 354 miRNA genes using miRNA microarrays and then performed expression profile analysis on these miRNAs for all developmental stages. While 106 miRNAs were expressed in all stages, 248 miRNAs were egg- and pupa-specific, suggesting that insect miRNAs play a significant role in embryogenesis and metamorphosis. We selected eight miRNAs for quantitative RT-PCR analysis; six of these were consistent with our microarray results. In addition, we searched for orthologous miRNA genes in mammals, a nematode, and other insects and found that most silkworm miRNAs are conserved in insects, whereas only a small number of silkworm miRNAs has orthologs in mammals and the nematode. These results suggest that there are many miRNAs unique to insects.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_131.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/DSGGq03fbMM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236222482889"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1938">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8dc0e721dd9d3bd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Advocacy Success: NIMH Use of Stimulus Money Includes  Services-Research</title><published>2009-03-05T00:21:26Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T00:21:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/RKwaO0foAl8/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236220784701"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/basics_significant_figures.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a87dcffe729e1974</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Basics"/><title type="html">Basics: Significant Figures</title><published>2009-03-05T01:55:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T01:55:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/MNQ1B_Pdsqg/basics_significant_figures.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/basics_significant_figures.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; After my post the other day about rounding errors, I got a ton of
requests to explain the idea of &lt;em&gt;significant figures&lt;/em&gt;. That's
actually a very interesting topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The idea of significant figures is that when you're doing
experimental work, you're taking measurements - and measurements
always have a limited precision. The fact that your measurements - the
inputs to any calculation or analysis that you do - have limited
precision, means that the results of your calculations likewise have
limited precision. Significant figures (or significant digits, or just "sigfigs" for short) are a method of tracking measurement
precision, in a way that allows you to propagate your precision limits
throughout your calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Before getting to the rules for sigfigs, it&amp;#39;s helpful to show why
they matter. Suppose that you&amp;#39;re measuring the radius of a circle, in
order to compute its area. You take a ruler, and eyeball it, and end
up with the circle&amp;#39;s radius as about 6.2 centimeters. Now you go to
compute the area: π=3.141592653589793... So what&amp;#39;s the area of the
circle? If you do it the straightforward way, you&amp;#39;ll end up with a
result of 120.76282160399165 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The problem is, your original measurement of the radius was 
far too crude to produce a result of that precision. The real
area of the circle could easily be as high as 128, or as low as 
113, assuming typical measurement errors. So claiming that your

Since my son is only 8 years old, I am not too familiar with the situation after school yet. I hear from the parents with older children that they start to have more problems when the young adults leave school, usually at age 18. There are vocational training programs to integrate people with autism into regular jobs, there are also special workshops and day programs, but I hear that it is quite difficult to find a place that fits. Also, there seems to be a shortage in good living situations: there are some group homes that seem very good but do not have enough openings, and there are long waiting lists to get into a good group home. Some members of our parent organization are currently working on new projects for autistic adults concerning work and/or living. There is no doubt; as diagnosis numbers rise, we will have more and more adults on the spectrum. Both the German government and society will have to find new, more and better solutions for adult care and inclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disability ID &amp;amp; Caretaking Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are a number of additional services provided by the German government. Once the child is diagnosed, parents can go to a governmental office and apply for a disability ID. The office will process the application by evaluating doctors' letters. The ID will then state the degree of handicap (in case of Early Childhood Autism: 100%) and will also state other needs (H – helpless on his own, B – needs to to be accompanied at all times, etc.) These codes can be translated into certain rights. For example, if the child needs to be accompanied at all times and is helpless on his own, the accompanying person will not have to pay for public services. For example, entrance to the zoo will be free for the accompanying adult, and even traveling all throughout Germany on a high-speed train is free, as children under the age of 14 don't have to pay, and the accompanying adult doesn't have to pay, one just shows the conductor the child's disability ID. This is one of my favorite benefits: it allows us to visit my parents and grandmother, who live 400 miles away, as many times as we please without having to consider travel costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ID has been processed, it can also be handed into the health insurance and they will send a specialist to evaluate the level of care needed at home. Any family will then receive "caretaking money" from the health insurance, regardless of the family income. There are three levels of care:&lt;br&gt;
•	Level I pays 215 Euros each month ($272)&lt;br&gt;
•	Level II pays 420 Euros/ month and ($533)&lt;br&gt;
•	Level III pays 675 Euros/ month ($856)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of "caretaking money" was introduced in 1995 as part of the Caretaking Act. It is a means of acknowledgment of the work that a family does at home, as well as a means of encouragement to provide care at home rather than sending a family member with a disability to live in an institution. So one has to realize that this is not really an altruistic gesture from the government. The Caretaking Act actually tries to reduce costs, because providing around-the-clock professional care in an institution is much more expensive than awarding a family with "caretaking money." Since families with disabled family members supply care regardless of their income, politicians made it a point that such an acknowledgment could not be tied to or affected by income. Families can spend this money whichever way they want. The payments have just been increased as part of the reform of the Caretaking Act, effective July 1, 2008, and will gradually be increased further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the reform of July 2008 implemented a new health insurance service: families can now get an additional respite benefit of 100-200 Euros per month. This benefit cannot be received in cash, but only be used through a caretaker service, which is registered with the health insurance. Payments are again independent from family income. For example, parents can use the caretaker service in the evenings or during weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caretaking Act of 1995 also contains other benefits, for example for health care products and assistive technology (we just received a talker through that service), as well as benefits of short-term care. In case a single parent has to go into the hospital, for example, the child can stay in a children's group home for short-term care and the health insurance will fully cover the costs. The Caretaking Act also provides a benefit of convalescent care which can be used every 2-3 years. The child and one parent can live in a specialized spa-like house for three weeks where they receive health treatments like massages, attend gym classes, go swimming, can see a psychologist on staff if wanted, attend parent self-help meetings etc. This benefit is a means of respite for both the child and the parent. Some activities offered in the house are for mutual activities and some are separate from each other. Upon arrival at the facility, an individual schedule is being devised, which should provide three weeks of "active relaxation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these services aim at enabling a family life beyond institutionalization, giving the caretakers the strength to sustain stressful situations, in the belief that the family member with a disability will also benefit from stable, healthy and balanced caretakers. (The Caretaking Act is not only effective for disabilities, but also for chronic illnesses and care for the elderly, so that people are encouraged to care for their elderly parents at home. However, benefits vary depending on the degree of disability and the coded "level of care.") &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this about sums up services in Germany. Even though we like to complain about the bureaucracy attached to all services, I feel that services and benefits are quite comprehensive, especially financially. However, I also feel that education can be improved in the area of autism specific education methods, and society as a whole needs to open up more to the concept of inclusion in every-day life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Monika S.

&lt;p&gt;1) Apparently, a lot of pieces from the Texas fireball have now been recovered. &lt;a href="http://geology.com/meteorites/meteorite-hunting.shtml"&gt;Geology.com has a great written account&lt;/a&gt; of a meteorite hunter who, along with a group of other rock hunters, found something like 100 pieces of the falling rock. There are fantastic pictures of the meteorites as well. Hurray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) A big bolide was seen over Finland earlier today. &lt;a href="http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/03/meteorite_lands_in_southern_savo_589580.html"&gt; A news report claims a rock fell all the way down to the ground&lt;/a&gt;, but I don’t think that’s actually confirmed. Also, they say it came in at 15 meters/second, which is slower than highway speeds. I think they meant kilometers/second, but I guess the metric system confuses Europeans sometimes, too. Anyway, it’s snowy there, so it’s unlikely they’ll find any meteorite even if it does exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236210543865"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/fellowship_for_public_outreach.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c80d7f7540351ac5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">Fellowship for public outreach about humane use of animals in research.</title><published>2009-03-04T21:00:10Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T21:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/29UTAbbL9lo/fellowship_for_public_outreach.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/fellowship_for_public_outreach.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/www.amprogress.org/HayreFellowship"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/upload/2009/03/Hayre_Home_Page.jpg" width="201" height="262" alt="Hayre_Home_Page.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Recommendations for good restaurants and bars near the convention center are also always appreciated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/off_to_learn_some_more_surgical_oncology.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/VXz7wvz-0nU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236205941845"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2019462569218935089">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40bee14b2a8eaf7a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Good Book Looks like a Good Book!</title><published>2009-03-04T21:27:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-05T02:42:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/PZZO5xQASEQ/good-book-looks-like-good-book.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/2019462569218935089/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=2019462569218935089" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/good-book-looks-like-good-book.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">It's already a bestseller, ranked right now at 170 on Amazon!

Special Afternoon Inquisition brought to you by Oskar Kennedy, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6236"&gt;winner of last week’s Comment o’ the Week&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us live in societies that are at least ostensibly secular.&lt;br&gt;
(Apologies to anyone reading this in Tehran) In practice, however, we&lt;br&gt;
rarely achieve this ideal. The UK still has an established church. In&lt;br&gt;
the US, atheists are among the least trusted social groups, and&lt;br&gt;
politicians are obligated to put their faith on display in order to&lt;br&gt;
get elected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for my Afternoon Inquisition, I’d like to explore the&lt;br&gt;
possibilities of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would your ideal secular society look like, and how would it&lt;br&gt;
operate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think law and government, but also social structures, moral codes and&lt;br&gt;
anything else that you’d like to throw in. And feel free to use&lt;br&gt;
real-world examples where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236200611509"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/04/extirpate/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53224eb2b10ad0cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">EXTIRPATE!</title><published>2009-03-04T20:09:18Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T20:09:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/04/extirpate/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Linking to The Sun makes me feel a little skeevy, but this is too funny not to mention: &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2289396.ece?OTC-RSS&amp;amp;ATTR=News"&gt;workers cleaning out a pond in England found a surprise&lt;/a&gt;: a Dalek!

Try and disprove it, fucko).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that all the TCM weirdos and people who have been "healed" by acupuncture will come out of the damn woodwork now to say how "closed minded" I am and that I can't argue with 2000 years of results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I damn well can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/yawnanother_acupuncture_study.php"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/acupuncture.html"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; again we see clinical trials that are ill-designed showing ambiguously positive results, only to be examined critically and found to be so much more than wanting.  In fact, to call some of these "wanting" is sort of like saying, &lt;i&gt;"Micheal Phelps...he can swim pretty good, right?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acupuncture is an elaborate placebo and placebos only work if you believe in them (therefore the "treatment" is meaningless).  You can bitch and moan all you want, but the bottom line is that acupuncutre has had 2000 years to convince people it's effective and it's failed.  You show me a well-controlled, blinded, placebo trial where acupuncture out-performs sham and no treatment, then maybe we can talk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During masage college, I took a pregnancy course.  It was a week long and dealt with the aspects of pregnancy that were relevant to RMTs.  Part of one day was spent talking about acupuncture and the instructor handed out needles in clear plastic sheaths.  They told us that the fleshy part between your thumb and index finger (on the back of your hand) was a point used to reduce, I think, labor pains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I, of course, being a douchebag, started sticking my needle in my wrist on the palm side of my arm, then in my forehead between my eyebrows; places that I figured must be important for something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other students came up to me after the session to ask what I was doing and where I was "trained".  I told them I had no idea what I was doing and that I was just sticking the needles in where I thought might have some effect.  Nothing happened, in case you were wondering.  Just so you know that the "between-the-eyebrows" point &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; important, here's a small blurb about it from Yin Yang House.com:&lt;blockquote&gt;Chinese Name Yintang &lt;br&gt;English Name Hall of Seal&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Location: Midway between the medial ends of the eyebrows&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Actions &amp;amp; Effects: &lt;br&gt;Calms the spirit - insomnia, anxiety, stress. &lt;br&gt;Frontal headache. &lt;br&gt;Sinus issues - congestion, sinusitis. &lt;br&gt;Tong Ren/Tam Healing System: Eye and sinus issues, useful point for building the energy in the head during qi gong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;from &lt;a href="http://www.yinyanghouse.com/acupuncturepoints/x-yintang"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;See, I wouldn't lie.  Oddly enough though, by my saying "nothing happened", I mean that none of the listed effects in any way were felt by me.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe a trained charlatan has to stick the needles in.  Maybe I didn't twirl them enough.  Maybe my spleen chakra was influenced by Saturn with Neptune rising which resulted in my 5th meridan being clogged with glowing scroat hairs.  It's hard to say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acupuncture does cause a physiological response.  I won't argue.  But, to be fair, getting stabbed in the small intestine causes a physiological response too, it's just not &lt;i&gt;usually&lt;/i&gt; therapeutic.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

(”Catfish and grape genetics”?  Ha ha ha!  “Promotion of astronomy”?  Bwah!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific line from McCain’s feed is the sarcastic “nothing says new jobs for average Americans like investing in astronomy”.  And I think this is the essence of why scientific projects continue to be held up for derision.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply, most people assume science has &lt;em&gt;absolutely nothing to do with them&lt;/em&gt;.  Nobody blinks an eye at massive building projects that funnel money to construction workers, even though construction accounts for only 5% of the &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"&gt;non-farm employment&lt;/a&gt; in the US.  However, even though the “average american” is highly unlikely to work in construction, they at least imagine that they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, science is perceived as something that is done by an elite group of people that “average americans” could never hope to join, or even meet.  So, it’s not that the government’s money is going to someone else, it’s that it seems to be going to someone they could never, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; be.  I’ve always found it terribly sad that scientists are almost universally cast as a tribe of “others”, so distinct from “average americans” that they cease to be realistic aspirational figures.  Pro-basketball players are equally unusual and elite in their physical attributes, training, and skill sets, but that doesn’t stop generation of kids wanting to grow up and play in the NBA.  In contrast, scientists often come across as “born that way”, and not as the end products of rigorous training that a large fraction of smarter-than-average people could engage in.  (And note that it’s not just the fault of the nebulous “media” — in their quest to climb to the top of the scientific heap, plenty of scientists cultivate an aura of “impressiveness”; while this may be useful for their individual careers, it can be plenty demoralizing for those on the lower rungs, who are &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/02/25/the-cult-of-genius/"&gt;questioning if they have what it takes&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this is a disconnect between what science actually does, and people’s perception of how it affects their own lives.  Most “average americans” probably don’t have many gripes with the NIH budget, because they understand that curing disease is something that could potentially help them in the end.  Most physical sciences, however, don’t present obvious, immediate connections to people’s day to day life, or to the main engines of the US economy.  Those connections are of course there (grape genetics = wine production = millions of dollars in farming economy = tasty beverages produced more cheaply domestically), but they’re not obvious.  Science is left playing catchup every time we’re mocked — yes, &lt;a href="http://blog.oregonlive.com/nwheadlines/2009/03/_more_northwest_front_pages_255.html"&gt;lots of articles came out&lt;/a&gt; pointing out that “volcano monitoring” was in fact useful, but not in time to stop the initial spurt of derision on the national stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I don’t have any obvious solution to this, except the usual calls for increased outreach and better science teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

This is part of the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?category_id=27915"&gt;international perspectives series&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In Germany, autism awareness has increased considerably within the last two decades. Doctors know more about autism, so that a diagnosis tends to be made earlier and more frequently. Hence, much like all the Western world, we also experience an upsurge in diagnosis numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a child is suspected to be on the spectrum, parents are referred to either a specialized center (for example a neurological pediatric clinic) or a physician in a private practice with a license for autism diagnosis (for example a child psychiatrist). Some cities also have "autism centers" which can run diagnostic tests. When a diagnosis is made, the center or doctor will discuss therapy options. In Germany, a relatively small number of children attends daycare under the age of three, therefore I do not know of any outside autism programs under that age. If the child is diagnosed earlier than three years of age, he or she will get Early Intervention at home, provided mostly by specialists coming to your house, offering traditional therapies like sensory integration, speech and occupational therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education and therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When children turn three years old, they usually attend nursery school, kindergarten and preschool. A child diagnosed with autism might be able to join a regular facility, if it has an integration focus. A lot of times however, regular facilities do not feel fit to accept autistic children due to a lack of experienced staff. For any such children, there are special ed facilities, which are specialized in therapeutic pedagogy and have specially educated staff. As education is run by the state and not federally administered, different states might have different policies. But generally speaking, autistic children are separated from neurotypical children very early on. This has been a matter of intensive discussion in the public for many years. These discussions have just increased after Germany signed and ratified the "UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities." The convention states the goal of inclusion. Some feel that a separated education system violates this. However, others feel that the specialized care and protected areas provided in special schools are beneficial to certain children with autism, especially the ones severely affected. Special schools have smaller class sizes, more and specialized staff, lesser exposure to noise etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering school at six years of age, the process basically advances in the same way. There are special ed schools with different areas of expertise, like schools for children with physical disabilities, and/or learning disabilities, speech and language problems, as well as schools for the cognitively challenged. Autistic children should be distributed into the type of school that fits their needs best. A child with an Asperger's diagnosis might accordingly be mainstreamed in a regular school, getting additional care and assistance. A severely affected child might be sent to the school for cognitively challenged children. Since the spectrum is broad, one cannot generalize. However, the discussion here is the same as for preschool years: is it beneficial to have special schools or would it be better to send all children to one school? Opinions vary widely and as always, there is probably no answer that fits all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In special ed schools, children will receive traditional therapies on-site: the buildings are usually equipped with separate therapy rooms, so that children have a class schedule on the one hand, and an individual schedule on the other hand. 2-4 times a year, all people involved (including parents) will meet in a "help conference" to work out and discuss the progress of the individual education plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All traditional therapies are covered fully by the health insurance without any co-payments. I should mention that we have universal health insurance in Germany, which employees receive through their employer, and unemployed receive it through the government, so that these benefits are equal for all people. Also, schools are state-run and free of cost except for a small fee for the lunch meals (which is paid for by the government if parents are unemployed). Next to traditional therapies, teachers and teacher's aides might implement specific autism interventions like PECS, TEACCH or ABA elements. But this is not always the case. It depends on the teacher's energy and willingness, as well as on the parents' involvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severely affected children can get additional one-on-one aides, also at no cost to the parents. In special schools, classes usually consist of 6 children, 1 teacher, 1 teacher's aide and 1 intern; the ratio adult-child is therefore 2:1. Some children might need 1:1 care, in that case school and parents can apply for a one-on-one aide who can guide the child and use PECS or TEACCH or other specific autism interventions more effectively. Though not every child gets this aide approved. The school boards try to save costs and it usually depends on the parents' advocacy to push for an additional aide to be approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, children are off school quite a lot of times throughout the year: 7 weeks in the summer, 2 weeks in the fall, 2 weeks for Christmas and New Year, 1 week in the winter, 3 weeks for Easter. During these times, schools sometimes remain closed entirely and sometimes they offer a daycare service. Severely affected children might not tolerate the daycare very well – which in turn might cause a problem for the parents' work schedule. Again, individual solutions need to be found and arranged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School is usually from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. There are additional hours available from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. But the staff ratio in the afternoon is not as good as during regular school hours and it makes for a very long day at school. Severely affected children sometimes cannot tolerate the long afternoon, they are challenged enough by attending class from 8-3. In that case, families can apply for services from another governmental program called "Individual case support." These services are being paid fully by the government, regardless of the family income, and a family might get anywhere between 6-20 hours additional care per week during afternoon hours at home. The caretakers are not always specialized in autism, but parents can search for specialized staff or they can train the caretakers themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are elaborate structures starting with Early Intervention and moving all throughout the curriculum, one has to emphasize that it is still not always easy to find the right therapists or the right school. Parents have to put quite an effort into the child's best support, and extensive bureaucracy does not exactly help either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that schools could be improved as far as autism specific interventions are concerned. A lot of times, teachers are not familiar with PECS and TEACCH etc. There is a need in further education for teachers and teacher's aides. We have founded a parent organization in Berlin to promote and organize additional training concerning autism specific interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Monika S.

Here is my solution in brief (details are linked to, and a much fuller explanation is needed):&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians do not believe in the God of the Bible, despite what they claim. Instead, they believe in the perfect being of St. Anselm in the eleventh century after centuries of theological gerrymandering. The Bible isn’t consistent in describing its God, but one probable description is as follows: Rather than creating the universe &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;, God fashioned the earth to rise out of the seas in divine conflict with the dragon sea god sometimes called &lt;em&gt;Rahab &lt;/em&gt;(in Job 26:9-12). This God is merely the “god of the gods,” who like the other gods had a body that needed to rest on the seventh day and was found walking in the “cool of the day” in the Garden of Eden. &lt;em&gt;Yahweh&lt;/em&gt;, the god of Israel, probably emerged out of a polytheistic amalgamation of gods known in the ancient Near East in pre-biblical times. In the ancient Near East, all pantheons were organized as families, and &lt;em&gt;Yahweh &lt;/em&gt;was simply one of the members of that family. Some biblical authors consider &lt;em&gt;Yahweh&lt;/em&gt;, the god of Israel, as one of many gods fathered by &lt;em&gt;Elyon &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Did-God-Have-Wife-Archaeology/dp/0802863949/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1236174123&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;whose wife was &lt;em&gt;Asherah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to whom was given the people and land of Israel to rule over (Deut. 32:8). This God was responsible for doing both good and evil, sending evil spirits to do his will and commanding genocide. As time went on, &lt;em&gt;Yahweh &lt;/em&gt;was believed to be the only God that existed. Still later, Satan was conceived as an evil rival in order to exonerate &lt;em&gt;Yahweh &lt;/em&gt;from being the creator of evil. Still later, in the New Testament the God of the Bible was eventuall stripped of physical characteristics and known as a "spiritual being" (although, in an era where gods could become men and where women were regarded as merely receptacles of the male seed, the virgin birth story is problematic in the New Testament, and hard to reconcile with a God who is considered a "spiritual being"). As theologians reflected on their God, they came to believe he created the universe &lt;em&gt;ex nihilo&lt;/em&gt;. Anselm finally defined him as the “greatest conceivable being.” But Anslem’s God is at odds with what we find in most of the Bible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The origin of the Christian cult started with an apocalyptic prophet who preached a doomsday message and gained a small following in Palestine. Jewish prophets like these were a dime a dozen and they had it easy given the harsh Roman rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Jesus was crucified his followers had visionary dreamlike or ecstatic experiences which led them to believe Jesus was alive in a heavenly type existence. As time went on an empty tomb sequence was added to the story as well as other mythic elements, like a virgin birth a transfiguration, and so forth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their story was of a God who loved people so much that he sent his Son to atone for our sins in a culture where human, animal, and child sacrifice was acceptable to large segments of society. This story made sense and so evangelists and missionaries like Paul were able to reach the people of the whole Roman empire who themselves were superstitious to the core, since they believed in many gods and goddesses and had no evidence for them either. The best story had the best chance of success in those times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since warriors go to war in the name of a god, and since the Christian religion was growing in numbers, Constantine went to war in the name of the Christian cross and established a Christian empire. Upon becoming Emperor he called upon the church to settle their disputes which decided orthodox doctrines at that time. So Constantine's battle on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Milvian_Bridge"&gt;Milvian bridge&lt;/a&gt; decided which religion would dominate in western cultures from that time forward. We have inherited our religious beliefs because of this whole process. Had Constantine fought in the name of another god then history might have turned out differently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since that time &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/christianity-simply-reinvents-itself.html"&gt;Christianity has simply reinvented itself in every generation&lt;/a&gt;, much like a chameleon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only reason Christians refuse to acknowledge these things is because they simply are defending their culturally adopted beliefs. Many Christians refuse to even acknowledge that human beings don’t &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/01/revealing-reasoning-of-believer-review.html"&gt;reason logically about this&lt;/a&gt; at all! That’s because, as Dr. David Eller argues, our culturally inherited beliefs are what we use &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1578849209?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1578849209&amp;amp;adid=1G0HZB5T06A3BTVMVAP9&amp;amp;"&gt;to see with&lt;/a&gt;. These inherited beliefs are much like our very eyes themselves, so it’s extremely difficult to examine that which we use to see with. We cannot easily pluck out our eyes to look at them since we use our eyes to see. But we must do this if we truly want to examine that which we were taught to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as far as where we got our morals from in our western cultures, the same things can be said. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/what-can-account-for-morality-were.html"&gt;Our morals evolved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no basis for believing. The only antidote to the brainwashing of our culture &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/best-antidote-to-brainwashing-demanding.html"&gt;is to demand evidence&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian puzzle has been solved for me. In this sense Christians are no different than &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/icelanders-and-their-culturally.html"&gt;roughly half of Icelanders who believe in the existence of elves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Of course, among such people as the neighboring Phoenicians they continued to be worshiped. Even amongst monotheistic Jews, though no longer worshiped, the Canaanite deities sometimes left a kind of ‘afterglow’. This is perhaps most marked in the world of apocalyptic. For example, the seventy sons of God, originally denoting the gods of the pantheon under El, with whom Yahweh became identified, now became demoted to the status of angels, the seventy guardian angels of the nations attested in 1 Enoch. Again, I have noted how the name of ‘Baal the Prince’ (&lt;em&gt;zbl b’l&lt;/em&gt; in Ugaritic) became transformed into Beelzebul, the Prince of the Demons or Satan, in the gospels. The relation between Baal and El became encapsulated in the relationship of the one like the son of man and the Ancient of Days in the apocalyptic imagery of Daniel 7, as did the chaos monster, and the seven-headed Leviathan of Canaanite mythology lives on even in the New Testament, where both the seven-headed dragon of Revelation 12, symbolizing Satan, and the seven-headed beast of Revelation 13, symbolizing Rome, derive from him. I have augured too that the imagery of the resurrection of the dead, another important concept in apocalyptic, also derives ultimately from the resurrection of Baal. However, although these images lived on, everything became transformed in the light of monotheism, and it is arguably monotheism (at first &lt;em&gt;monolatry&lt;/em&gt;), rather than God’s mighty acts in history as used to be argued, that most distinguishes the Old Testament form the religions of the other nations of the ancient Near East.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

They sifted through over 17,000 quasar signatures to find this rare pair, sitting in the center of quasar SDSS 153636.22+044127.0 at a distance of about 4 billion light years from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr09/images/Boroson-Graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/binary_blackholes.jpg" alt="Binary black holes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many double black holes are known (for example, &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2002/0192/"&gt;NGC 6240&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081109.html"&gt; 3C 75&lt;/a&gt;) — remnants of ancient galactic mergers, two galaxies colliding and eventually forming a single, bigger galaxy — these are widely-spaced pairs (30,000 and 10,000 light years apart, respectively, for NGC 6240 and 3C 75), and while it’s likely that in those cases the black holes orbit each other, it’s not completely certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new case, while it’s still not 100% rock-solid certain the two holes orbit one another, it’s very, very likely. First, by examining the redshifts carefully, Boroson and Lauer determined the two black holes are at the same distance from Earth. Second, they are separated by a very small amount: only about 1/3 of a light year separates the two monsters, making it incredibly unlikely they are unaffiliated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unlike other black hole binary candidates seen before, this pair’s authenticity is testable! They are so close and moving so rapidly — &lt;em&gt;6000 kilometers per second&lt;/em&gt;, an appreciable fraction of the speed of light — that the orbital period of the two is only about 100 years. Examining them again in just a few years should reveal their orbital motion around each other, clinching their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that the two black holes are so close together that even the most powerful telescopes in the world would see them as a single object (in fact, the astronomers plan to take Hubble observations to see if they can resolve the pair or not; they expect they cannot which will further support their claim that this is a single system). We know there are two there because of their spectra. Imagine matter swirling around a black hole, and imagine further it emits a very narrow color range of, say, yellow light. As it orbits the black hole, it will sometimes be headed toward us, and sometimes away. The Doppler shift changes the color of the light, red and blue-shifting it over the course of the orbit. &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/Pr_1_2005_s_en.html"&gt;There are animations on an ESA page that may help you understand this&lt;/a&gt;. In those videos, sound is used as an analogy for color — lower pitch is redder light, and higher pitch is bluer light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of matter circling the drain of a black hole, forming a disk. We see red shifted light from the all the material in disk heading away from us, and blue shifting from the material in the disk headed toward us. We see all of this at the same time, so instead of a single color of light from the disk, it gets smeared out by that motion, forming essentially a bell curve (no, you won’t be graded on this). That curve, called a broadened line, is the signature of the black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Boroson and Lauer saw were &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; such broad line regions in the spectra, indicating &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; black holes. What’s cool too is that the mass of the black hole affects how broad the line is; the more massive it is, the more powerful its gravity, the faster material moves, so the broader the Doppler shift is. By carefully examining the broadening, they were able to determine that the black holes had masses of &lt;em&gt;20 million and 1 billion times the mass of the Sun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty hefty; the black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy is only about 4 million solar masses. These guys are  real bruisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s a pretty safe call that this really is a binary pair of black holes, two gaping maws of death circling each other at a distance of about 3 trillion kilometers, each supermassive and actively consuming material. They formed their bond when their parent galaxies collided eons ago, and eventually, billions or possibly hundreds of billions of years from now, these two giant black holes will merge themselves, swallowing each other and forming a single object with their combined mass. That’s one reason these beasts are so rare: they eat each other, leaving behind a single black hole. It was only through foresight, planning, and hard work that this pair was found at all. There may not be many more like them in the whole Universe, so every one we find gives us precious insight into the clockwork process of the cosmos itself.&lt;/p&gt;

He is very upset that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/louisiana_boycotts_science_sci.php"&gt;The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology is boycotting Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, and he informs us all in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/03/michael_egnor_is_a_friggen_nut.php"&gt;a long &lt;i&gt;argumentum ad populum&lt;/i&gt; that the ignorant outnumber us&lt;/a&gt;, addressed to the president and members of SICB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans are creationists, in the sense that they believe that God played an important role in creating human beings and they don't accept a strictly Darwinian explanation for life. And they think that they ought to be able to ask questions about evolution in their own public schools. They don't share your passion for ideological purity in science classes. They have a quaint notion that science depends on the freedom to ask questions, and their insistence on academic freedom is catching on. They don't want religion taught in the science classroom, but they know that students are not learning about all of the science surrounding evolution. Seventy-eight percent of Americans support academic freedom in the teaching of evolution in schools, and that number is rising fast -- it's up 9% in the past 3 years. People clearly resent your demand for censorship. After all, it's their children in their schools, and they aren't happy with a bunch of supercilious Darwinists telling them that they can't even question Darwinism in their own classrooms. So if you're going to boycott all the creationists who despise you, you'll eventually have to hold all of your conventions in Madison or Ann Arbor. Keep up the arrogance and eventually you won't have to boycott people at all. People will boycott you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa. I'm impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the open admission that the Discovery Institute's audience are the god-fearin' creationists, and that the people they regard as "on their side" are plain-and-simple, unmodified creationists, not just the usual Intelligent Design creationists. That's useful to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also the usual distortions. People ought to be able to ask questions about evolution in the public schools — that&amp;#39;s what science is all about, and I would &lt;i&gt;encourage&lt;/i&gt; kids to raise their hands and speak out in class. However, none of this argument is about squelching inquiry: it's about whether weak and discredited ideas, like ID, ought to be given special privilege and elevated to the standard curriculum. They shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're also seeing the usual deprecation of expertise. SICB is an organization of thousands of scientists who have invested years of their life in the study of biology. They are experts. Against that, we have millions of people in Louisiana who, while competent in their own areas of work, have very little knowledge of biology. According to Michael Egnor, the people we should listen to on this relatively rarefied subject are the majority who know nothing about it. Would he be quite so sanguine if we dismissed his specialization, neurosurgery, and suggested that he needed to follow the suggestions of a roofer from Baton Rouge? Is it "censorship" that he doesn't allow his patients' families into the operating room to give him a hand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madison and Ann Arbor are both lovely places to have conventions, and I certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t complain if SICB held their meetings there — it&amp;#39;s much closer to home, for one thing. But Egnor left out a few cities. How about Berkeley and Eugene, Seattle and Tucson, New York and Philadelphia, Austin and Cleveland, Champaign-Urbana and Chapel Hill…and I could go on. These cities and university towns are all part of America, too, and they are places where we find majorities who do not accept the ideology of creationism…because their populations are better educated and less shackled to religious dogma. These are good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm also confident that the people of Louisiana are a mix of the uninformed and the scientifically competent, and that many are good people who deserve better than the falsehoods institutions like the Discovery Institute will ladle out. It would be great to have more scientific conventions in New Orleans (if nothing else, because the cuisine is &lt;i&gt;fabulous&lt;/i&gt;). However, when the government of the state promotes policies that are damaging to science, scientists have no choice but to reject them in any way they can.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not careful, "creationists" (80% of Americans) might notice this irony: you boycott their states, but you forgot to boycott their money. If one percent of the people you've censored and boycotted wrote letters to their congressmen demanding a defunding of evolutionary research -- a boycott of you -- the grant money currently allocated to advancing Darwinist ideology (it's ideologues, not scientists, who censor) would be re-allocated to genuine non-ideological science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a word for this: demagoguery. What Egnor proposes here is nothing less than a naked threat to use the ignorance of the mob to attack science. And you haven't heard anything yet. Look at this attitude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your arrogance and disrespect for academic freedom demeans the scientific profession, and your boycott of people who don't capitulate to your censorship is risible. You're actually debasing Darwinism, which, after eugenics and a century and a half of third-rate science, is no mean accomplishment. Most people don't see your refusal to visit their state as a "threat." Honestly, they'd rather you made your boycott all-inclusive, so you'd miss all of their legislative sessions and federal court hearings as well. So back off the "boycott" stuff. Just say you misspoke, or pretend you never said it at all. You Darwinists are good at covering your tracks (remember "junk DNA"?). Keep in mind that you're living off the people you're censoring and boycotting. Your livelihood is dependent on their largesse, and, in "comparative biology" vernacular, it's unwise for parasites to boycott their hosts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My advice: just keep suckling at the public teat and pretend the boycott never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we see exposed the Discovery Institute&amp;#39;s opinion of scientists: they are parasites, suckling at the public teat, and that a scientific organization&amp;#39;s boycott of a state is just fine…and that we should be divorced from civic responsibilities altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also see his ignorance of biology on display. Evolutionary biology is a third rate science. Why is &amp;quot;comparative biology&amp;quot; in quotes? When did parasitism become the provenance of comparative biology? It&amp;#39;s a concept in common use, you know. And of course we remember junk DNA — we know that most of the human genome is junk. There is no covering of any tracks there, so I have no idea what he&amp;#39;s talking about. It&amp;#39;s probably yet another delusion of the creationist mind, like a schizophrenic babbling about his satellite-based mind control rays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we really have to remember henceforth is exactly what the Discovery Institute's agenda actually is, and there it is in Egnor's freely expressed opinion: the incitement of an intentionally misinformed public to silence scientific inquiry, all in the guise of ending an imaginary censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's leave laughing. There's a convention in much of the kook email I receive that they howl at length at me, and then sign off with a conventional and inappropriately friendly signature that is entirely at odds with everything they wrote. Egnor fits right in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cordially,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mike Egnor, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, an update to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6315"&gt;my post yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; bemoaning the lack of journalistic integrity in science reporting: Remember Newsweek’s Sharon Begley, who was a speaker at TAM 6? While at TAM, we interviewed her on &lt;a href="http://theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;amp;pid=166"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide&lt;/a&gt;, and I very much disagreed with her opinion that journalists as a whole were doing their jobs properly and that it was up to scientists to make better efforts to market their work. I also disagreed with her strongly when she criticized Penn Jillette for &lt;a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2008/07/03/penn-jillette-bashes-newsweeks-non-scientist-sharon-begley"&gt;something he didn’t even say&lt;/a&gt; at the conference, a topic we covered on a later podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now there’s something new to criticize her about, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/doctors_hate_science_more_like_sharon_be.php"&gt;Orac has done a wonderful job of it&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/187006"&gt;most recent column&lt;/a&gt; throws nuance out the window in favor of the headline &lt;em&gt;Why Doctors Hate Science&lt;/em&gt;, a statement that naturally leaves Orac a bit puzzled, and by “puzzled” I mean he says she’s full of shit. Go read his post for all the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begley’s column is yet another example of a journalist oversimplifying an issue to the detriment of the public, and I say that as someone who accepts and appreciates the fact that often we must simplify complex issues in order to create an understandable and enjoyable narrative. By broadly claiming that doctors hate science, she undermines the work of many doctors like Orac or &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Steve Novella and friends at Science-based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; who persistently call for stricter regulations and a stronger focus on science in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In happier news, Saturday, March 14, is Pi Day (3.14)! To celebrate, I thought it would be fun to have a pie fight on Boston Common. Here’s a &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/djor3c"&gt;Facebook event page&lt;/a&gt; if you’re on there and would like to RSVP. Invite your friends – the more, the merrier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Bostonian events, Jeff Cutler visited the most recent Boston Skeptics in the Pub with Tim Farley and recorded some great audio. You can listen over on his blog, &lt;a href="http://bowlofcheese.com/?p=1581"&gt;Bowl of Cheese&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks Jeff, it was very nice to see you. Also: mmm, cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I received an absolutely amazing and wonderful present yesterday from &lt;a href="http://www.ultimatecupcake.com"&gt;Ultimate Cupcakes&lt;/a&gt;. U.C. is a bakery run by a very cool skeptic named Tony, who was kind enough to send me all the delicious flavors they offer. All were outrageously tasty, and if the pumpkin cupcakes came in a never-ending box, I’d be the happiest diabetic in the world. So thanks, Tony! Ultimate Cupcakes are now the official cupcakes of &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236187159292"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/adnaan_wasey_on_the_science_wr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6a07e633920f820</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Reporting"/><title type="html">Adnaan Wasey on the Science Writers in New York Panel for Social Media</title><published>2009-03-04T16:03:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T16:03:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/T51FH5xJUwY/adnaan_wasey_on_the_science_wr.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/adnaan_wasey_on_the_science_wr.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/MgOT2QGC-n4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/adnaan_wasey_on_the_science_wr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/T51FH5xJUwY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236187159292"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/congratulations_6.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec9ec7fb1748f908</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Congratulations....</title><published>2009-03-04T16:02:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T16:02:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ugrEZaNxeGo/congratulations_6.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/congratulations_6.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;....to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/this_might_be_the_start_of_a_m.php" title=""&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; for getting a monthly writing gig in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/mar/01/simon-singh-chris-french-pz-myers-andy-miah-new-science-writing" title=""&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://molphil.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/socialism-in-science-or-why-open-access-may-ultimately-fail/" title=""&gt;Socialism in science, or why Open Access may ultimately fail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;OK. So here's the argument: Science needs to be made known through publishing. In order for science to be published, we need a team of people who will do the job of supervising the review process, editing, storing, and distributing bite-sized pieces of science called papers. These people need to be paid. Traditional closed access (CA) journals pay their employees from revenues they generate by selling their journal or the right to access it online. OA journals accomplish the same through selling space in their journal to people who want to publish in them. The main question is "Can OA journals publish high impact science, and also break even financially?".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good people, like Peter Suber and Stevan Harnad respond to some of those misconceptions in the comments. This is followed by the second post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://molphil.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/socialism-in-science-part-2-i-am-wiser-but-not-quite-convinced/" title=""&gt;Socialism in science - Part 2 - I am wiser but not quite convinced&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, it is with sadness that I must conclude I am still skeptical about the chances of the diverse OA initiatives to completely substitute for the current CA publishing models. Call me doubting Thomas, but I want to see proofs of the feasibility of profitable high-impact open access publishing before I jump on the bandwagon and sing songs in praise of OA. All I can see right now is a lot of unfounded hope and plenty of examples to the contrary. Convince me if you can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron Neylon tries to respond on his blog: &lt;a href="http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/03/03/what-is-the-cost-of-peer-review-can-we-afford-not-to-have-high-impact-journals/" title=""&gt;What is the cost of peer review? Can we afford (not to have) high impact journals?&lt;/a&gt; (FriendFeed discussion &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/8270457b-004c-c268-26c6-3b2ec203facd/What-is-the-cost-of-peer-review-Can-we-afford-not/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question I would like to ask though is different. The Molecular Philosophy post skips the zeroth order questions. Can we afford high impact publications?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the third post is up (with a plea to me personally to post the links and send some traffic): &lt;a href="http://molphil.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/socialism-in-science-part-3-the-utopian-system-of-post-publication-peer-review/" title=""&gt;Socialism in science - Part 3 - the Utopian system of post-publication peer review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Last, but not least, I, and many people I know, like to peruse tables of contents of the most prestigious journals just to get the idea of what is currently at the very forefront of scientific discovery. The papers published in these journals are usually very good science and are a pleasure to read, whether they are directly related to my research, or not. I don't want to give that pleasure up and get a scientific del.ic.ious-like sexiness contest instead.

&lt;p&gt;OK. So I think I know why you guys don't get it. You are good, noble people and you think, after a Greek philosopher or another, that if you show people the right thing to do, they will do it, just like you would. Well surprise, surprise: You are WRONG! Modern psychology makes it clear that people need a stick or a carrot to move anywhere and counting on their intrinsic goodness and noble instincts will get you nowhere. Sure, there will be people like yourselves who will do the RIGHT THING, but if you are set out to take over the world, you'd better have your stick and carrot business sorted out. As an unquestionable authority in the art of rant, Comrade PhysioProf, once said "Academic science is not a Care Bears fucking** tea party!". I'll Amen to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/c9wnvn" title=""&gt;journalistic curmugeons&lt;/a&gt;, doesn't it: "But I like the smell of ink and paper! And you can't live without us!"&lt;/p&gt;

Call Senators Now.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Washington Post is reporting that Senate votes to confirm Jane Lubchenco as NOAA Administrator and John Holdren as Science Advisor are currently being obstructed by a Democratic Senator. Quoting multiple unnamed sources, the Post says that New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez has placed an "anonymous hold" on the nominations in order to try to gain leverage for some issues related to Cuba that he's interested in. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/03/the_latest_outrage_holds_on_ho.php" title=""&gt;The Latest Outrage: Holds on Holdren, Lubchencho&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Washington Post (the news part) reports that the man who is now one of my senators, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, has placed a hold on the nominations of John Holdren and Jane Lubchencho, and won't allow them to be voted on. Reportedly, "Menendez is using the holds as leverage to get Senate leaders' attention for a matter related to Cuba rather than questioning the nominees' credentials."

&lt;p&gt;What a complete outrage. These nominees need to work on climate change, science advising, and much else; they have no role in Cuba policy. Obama named them back in December--they should be in their offices by now. This is the most shallow form of politicking, and prevents the new administration from getting going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/03/science_in_the_senate_its_not.php" title=""&gt;Science in the Senate: It's Not Just Menendez; Full Court Press Badly Needed.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It appears that yesterday's reports that New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez was holding up the confirmation of both the Science Advisor and the NOAA administrator were not entirely correct. He may well be delaying these confirmations, but he's apparently not the only one. CQ Politics is now reporting that the nominations are being held by multiple members of the Senate. Due to the holds, there is currently no confirmation vote scheduled on the floor.

&lt;p&gt;This is a very reliable report. CQ Politics is not basing this on anonymous sources. They are quoting Commerce Committee Chairman John Rockefeller. Rockefeller's committee has jurisdiction over the nominations, and held a confirmation hearing for both nominees last month. Given his position, it's very unlikely that Rockefeller is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 300-million-year-old brain of a relative of sharks and ratfish has been revealed by French and American scientists using synchrotron holotomography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). It is the first time that the soft tissue of such an old fossil brain has ever been found.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Brown University study of stroke victims has produced evidence that the frontal lobe of the human brain controls decision-making along a continuum from abstract to concrete, from front to back.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When it comes to the hippocampus, a brain structure vital to certain types of memory, size matters. Numerous studies have shown that bigger is usually better. Now researchers have found that elderly adults who are more physically fit tend to have bigger hippocampi and better spatial memory than those who are less fit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than 40 percent of women ages 18-59 experience sexual dysfunction, with lack of sexual interest -- hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD -- being the most commonly reported complaint, according to medical researchers. While some question the validity of this diagnosis, a multidisciplinary team from the Stanford University School of Medicine is devoted to objective investigation of such problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neuroscientists at Georgetown University Medical Center have, for the first time, shown what brain activity looks like when someone anticipates an action or sensory input which soon follows.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chronic stress takes a physical and emotional toll on our bodies and scientists are working on piecing together a medical puzzle to understand how we respond to stress at the cellular level in the brain.  Being able to quickly and successfully respond to stress is essential for survival.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Disrupting the function of a key molecule in the brain leads to microscopic brain abnormalities and schizophrenia-like behavior in mice. These abnormalities are similar to those seen in the autopsied brains of people who diagnosed with schizophrenia in life, according to a team of scientists at the Scripps Research Institute.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_616.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/FyijZI-O3l0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236185303365"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_day_of_dawkins.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c45bbf3a37f2972c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">A day of Dawkins</title><published>2009-03-04T15:40:33Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T15:40:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/8rpbYtcSNSo/a_day_of_dawkins.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_day_of_dawkins.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;He just got here, and already Richard Dawkins is stirring things up in Minnesota.

Hoyt, the NYT's  "Public Editor", said that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;My own broad guideline: If it looks as if it was intended to sow terror and it shocks the conscience, whether it is planes flying into the World Trade Center, gunmen shooting up Mumbai, or a political killer in a little girl’s bedroom, I’d call it terrorism — by terrorists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His paper, he says, is &amp;quot;more conservative in their use [of these terms] than I would be&amp;quot;.  This  conservatism continues in the coverage of Tuesday&amp;#39;s attack in Lahore on the Sri Lankan cricket team — the NYT story (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/asia/04pstan.html"&gt;8 Die as Gunmen in Pakistan Attack Cricket Team&lt;/a&gt;", 3/3/2009) uses "gunmen", "attackers", and "assailants", and refers to the November attackers in Mumbai as "militants".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the T-words were used by Bloomberg ("&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;amp;sid=aUMQgb_crJwM&amp;amp;refer=australia"&gt;Terrorists in Lahore kill 5 police, Attack Cricketers&lt;/a&gt;", 3/3/2009), the (London) Times ("&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article5837691.ece?openComment=true"&gt;Cricket must support Pakistan after terrorists target the sport for the first time&lt;/a&gt;", 3/3/2009), the Telegraph ("&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/srilanka/4932010/Sri-Lanka-cricket-attacks-Terrorists-hurt-international-brotherhood-of-sport.html"&gt;Sri Lanka cricket attacks: Terrorists hurt international brotherhood of sport&lt;/a&gt;", 3/3/2009), the Guardian ("&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/03/sri-lanka-cricket-pakistan-mumbai"&gt;Sri Lanka cricket team attack echoes deadly Mumbai offensive&lt;/a&gt;", 3/3/2009), The Age (Australia) ("&lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/world/pakistan-terror-nightmare-20090303-8nfd.html"&gt;Pakistan terror nightmare&lt;/a&gt;", 3/4/2009), Xinhua ("&lt;a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/03/content_10936635.htm"&gt;Terror attack on Sri Lankan cricket team perpetrated by enemies of Pakistan-Sri Lanka friendship&lt;/a&gt;" 3/3/2009), the (Pakistani) Daily Times ("&lt;a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C03%5C04%5Cstory_4-3-2009_pg7_18"&gt;National Assembly condemns Lahore terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt;") and many other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/03/sri-lanka-cricket-shooting"&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; starts out with "gunmen":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Fourteen masked and heavily armed gunmen remain at large today after launching an audacious commando-style attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore, killing six policemen and injuring seven players and officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but calls the Mumbai incidents "terror attacks"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In scenes similar to the terror attacks on Mumbai in November, the gunmen opened fire with AK47s, grenades and a rocket launcher, spraying the Sri Lankan team bus with bullets as it drove to the 60,000-seater Gaddafi stadium in Lahore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and later in the article, uses "terrorists" in the reporter's own voice, though in a somewhat hypothetical context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Today's attack in Lahore makes it appear that terrorists may have adopted new tactics, preferring guns to suicide bombings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A later &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/03/sri-lanka-cricket-pakistan-mumbai"&gt;background story&lt;/a&gt; uses "terrorists" in its lead sentence to name the Mumbai attackers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan's cultural capital, Lahore, bears all the hallmarks of the terrorists behind the Mumbai offensive, the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Clark Hoyt wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;What you call someone matters. If he is a terrorist, he is an enemy of all civilized people, and his cause is less worthy of consideration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Lahore attack, it's not yet clear what cause (other than political destablization in Pakistan) its authors espouse, because no group has claimed responsibility, and the police investigation (which the Guardian describes as "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/03/pakistan-lahore-shooting-sri-lanka"&gt;shambolic&lt;/a&gt;") seems unlikely to produce clear and believable results. But the attack itself seems to meet all the usual T-word criteria: non-state violence deliberately targeting civilians in order to promote fear for political ends. So the NYT is being consistent, at least, in refusing to change its editorial policy for a case in which no one, anywhere in the world, seems willing to publicly support or even excuse the, well, terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other news outlets, including &lt;a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-38303920090303"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3cM6jl_bDzxwkoM315Q6-iIMPiA"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_PAKISTAN_CRICKETERS_ATTACKED?SITE=AP&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;, etc. are also sticking with "gunmen", "assailants", "attackers",  or "militants". But even Al Jazeera ("&lt;a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/03/20093342556242789.html"&gt;Cricketers wounded in Lahore attack&lt;/a&gt;"), which uses "armed men", "attackers", and "assailants" when describing the events in its own voice, quotes Lahore's police chief and the Punjabi governor calling them "terrorists" (which the cited NYT story did not do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the NYT story does use T-words in expressing some generalities near the end, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;One South Asia specialist also raised the possibility that Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka might have asked Lashkar-e-Taiba militants in Pakistan to attack the cricket team. If true, this would be an ominous sign of collaboration between regional terrorist groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me as odd to call the Tigers and LeT &amp;quot;regional terrorist groups&amp;quot;, while referring to the LeT members who might hypothetically have been recruited  as &amp;quot;Lashkar-e-Taiba militants&amp;quot; — and using the usual &amp;quot;gunmen&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;assailants&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;attackers&amp;quot; etc. to describe the unknown individuals, of unknown allegiance, who actually did carry out the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next paragraph, the story says that "American experts voiced concern that such attacks might be the new terrorist strike of choice instead of suicide bombings"; but then goes on to say that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The attack, which began at 9 a.m. Tuesday, appeared to have been well planned. Because it occurred on the third day of the cricketers’ match, the &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;assailants&lt;/span&gt; had time to carry out reconnaissance on the previous mornings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So curiously, the story uses &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;terrorist&lt;/span&gt; several times in non-quoted contexts, but only to refer to groups as a whole, or to types of attack, never to individual group members or to the actual perpetrators of the latest "terrorist strike of choice". I wonder if this is an explicit editorial policy, or just a case where some opinion leakage is occurring in slightly more abstract referential contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236182714826"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/susi_neunmalklug.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cc37f8d048acd45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Communicating science"/><title type="html">Susi Neunmalklug</title><published>2009-03-04T15:14:56Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T15:14:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/IaamJr8M2Zs/susi_neunmalklug.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/susi_neunmalklug.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;She is such a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cgJgnG9YzY"&gt;smarty-pants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But I wanted to reinforce a very important point we have been discussing over there regarding Senator Tom Harkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin, along with Orrin Hatch, was the force behind DSHEA - the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 that removed herbs and supplements, essentially, out from under FDA regulation. This resulted in the explosion of the supplement industry, happily jumping through this giant loop hole manufactured for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHEA is bad law and has significantly weakened health protection for Americans. Harkin is clearly a true-believer when it comes to supplements and cultish medical practices. However, the &lt;a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=300051"&gt;top contributor to his campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 2007-2008 was from employees of Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company selling supplements and herbs with dubious health claims. Hatch’s home state is Utah, which is considered to be the epicenter of the supplement industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Harkin hosted a senate hearing and invited some of the luminaries of the CAM movement to speak. The clear purpose of this hearing was to push a specific agenda - to hijack Obama’s healthcare reform initiative to further infiltrate pseudoscience and sectarian medical beliefs into the healthcare system. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;David Gorksi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=396"&gt;Peter Lipson&lt;/a&gt; both discuss this issue at SBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is the money-quote from Harkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How transparent. He clearly states that in his opinion the purpose of the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), like DSHEA forced down the throats of congress and the scientific community, was not to scientifically investigate whether CAM modalities work, but rather to validate CAM.  He is disappointed that the science has not worked out the way he intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His attitude, which he is not even savvy enough to realize is blatantly unscientific, is typical in the CAM world. The purpose of science is to validate and promote what they already know works - it is not to discover whether or not a modality works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further demonstrates his ignorance of science by complaining that the studies were designed to disprove, rather than prove, CAM modalities. That, of course, is the purpose of experiments in science - to prove a hypothesis wrong. Only when an idea survives multiple attempts at proving it wrong do we tentatively conclude that is may be correct. He is upset that the few good clinical trials that were done through NCCAM had the potential to falisfy his beliefs, because in the end they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His solution - promote CAM modalities anyway. Who cares what nasty science says. And, change the rules of science so that they can only validate his ideology, not refute it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the new-world order that Harkin and his CAM heroes want to bring - medical science subjugated to ideology.  We had eight years of science taking a back seat to ideology under Bush. I think it is premature to conclude that those days are over - there is just a new set of ideologies in town, not necessarily a new respect for science. To be fair I think overall the situation will improve under Obama (even if just from regression to the mean following Bush), but there are still pockets where ideology trumps science, and CAM is one such pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin’s transparent agenda needs to be exposed. He gave us a peak at the man behind the curtain, we should not let him try to quietly close the curtain again.&lt;/p&gt;

His usual tactic (actually, his &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; tactic) is to &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/forbes-loses-it-again-over-evolution/"&gt;claim that evolution is irrelevant to science&lt;/a&gt;, denying the importance of the theory to understanding discoveries about the natural world, and refusing to believe that it has any application at all to anything. In a &lt;a href="http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/opinion/8518074-47/story.csp"&gt;clear and straightforward op-ed, Stuart Faulk&lt;/a&gt; points out how easy it is to pick up any popular science magazine and find counterexamples to Skell's claims. And then he picks up a knife, sticks it in, and twists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how easily Skell's arguments can be dismissed, it is reasonable to ask why he would make them in the first place. He is just as capable of reading Scientific American as I am, and probably more qualified.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The short answer is that this is not a debate about factual truth and science, but about public opinion and religion. What Skell neglects to mention (but any Web search will show) is that he has long supported creationist causes. His guest viewpoint is but one of many letters supporting "intelligent design" and opposing the teaching of evolution in public schools, which he equates to "indoctrination of students to a worldview of materialism and atheism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s an important approach we have to take more often. The vocal charlatans of creationism are actually relatively few in number, and their histories need to be directly addressed and made public. Skell is most definitely not an impartial scientist looking at the evidence objectively: he has his made up, ignores the evidence (where he is even aware of it—professionally, he is a chemist), and then uses his faux authority to claim that the biological sciences lack substantial evidence that we actually have, all in the service of his religious dogma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting fact emerges at the end of the piece. Stuart Faulk is Skell&amp;#39;s son-in-law. I&amp;#39;d like to know how the family copes with Skell&amp;#39;s uninformed obnoxiousness…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/but_family_get-togethers_must.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XOhV57Kands" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236178396302"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/blasphemy_day.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/04fefab9c31c209c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Blasphemy Day</title><published>2009-03-04T13:43:52Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T13:43:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/h8SMFHbJlyY/blasphemy_day.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/blasphemy_day.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mark it on your calendar: 30 September is going to be Blasphemy Day.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blasphemy Day International is an international campaign seeking to establish September 30th as a national day to promote free speech and stand up in a show of solidarity for the freedom to mock and insult religion without fear of murder, violence, and reprisal. It is the obligation of the world's nations to safeguard dissent and the dissenters, not to side with the brutal interests of thugs who demand "respect" for their beliefs (i.e., immunity to being criticized or mocked or they threaten violence).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So if you support free speech, and the rights of those who disagree with religious views to voice their opinions peacefully, support our group and join the cause!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this &lt;a href="http://www.mediawatchwatch.org.uk/2009/02/26/blasphemy-day-international/"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blasphemy is a joyous, funny, socially progressive, and profoundly moral act. It deserves its own day. Join the group. Spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether it's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/medicine/antivaccination_lunacy/"&gt;refuting the lies of antivaccine zealots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;having a little fun&lt;/a&gt; with some of the more outrageously bizarre forms of pseudoscience, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/death_by_alternative_medicine_whos_to_bl.php"&gt;railing against cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt;, lamenting how easily pseudoscientific quackery has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_woo_aggregator.php"&gt;infiltrated medical academia&lt;/a&gt;, complaining about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/when_clinical_trials_are_designed_by_marketing.php"&gt;drug companies rigging clinical studies&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_early_detection_of_cancer_more_compl.php"&gt;trying to educate&lt;/a&gt; my readers about the complexities of cancer screening, support for science- and evidence-based medicine has been one of the two or three constants on Respectful Insolence since its very beginning. Indeed, I personally have even lamented at how little of the scientific method is taught in medical school, far too often emphasizing facts over critical thinking, leaving most physicians woefully unversed in the scientific method. This shortcoming has led some doctors to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/the_energizer_bunny_of_antievolution_1.php"&gt;become creationists&lt;/a&gt; and some to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt;embrace other pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;.

More important than the individual news items themselves is the striking pattern they bring into focus when viewed together - the growing and pernicious double-standard between mainstream medicine and so-called CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begley vs Doctors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science editor Sharon Begley wrote an interesting piece in Newsweek with the provocative title: &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/187006"&gt;Why Doctors Hate Science&lt;/a&gt;.  I was not particularly impressed with the article - it took a rather narrow approach to a complex problem and ran with it. She writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard not to scream when you see how many physicians, pharmaceutical companies, medical-device makers and, lately, hysterical conservatives seem to hate science, or at best ignore it. These days the science that inspires fear and loathing is “comparative-effectiveness research” (CER), which is receiving $1 billion under the stimulus bill President Obama signed. CER means studies to determine which treatments, including drugs, are more medically and cost-effective for a given ailment than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly agree that opposing or ignoring mainstream science is a serious problem, especially within healthcare. Begley points out, correctly, that there is great disparity among how physicians manage many ailments. Her interpretation of this fact, however, is far too simplistic to be helpful. She concludes that - well, doctors hate science. If they were listening to the science they would all be practicing the same way.  She further argues that doctors resist initiatives like CER because they resent attempts at controlling their practice, or limiting their profits, even with science. They would rather shoot from the hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that this is one part of the picture. It is also true, however, that there is great disparity among doctors in terms of their attitudes toward the relationship between scientific evidence and practice. There are those who are rigorously and proactively science-based. At the other end of the spectrum there are those who take a decidedly anti-scientific and anecdotal approach to medicine. While most physicians are somewhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question is - what is keeping most doctors from being more rigorously evidence-based. Begley suggests it is culture. However the institution of evidence-based medicine (EBM) is premised on another explanation - that the problem is simply that medicine has become so complex and is changing so quickly it is simply very difficult for health care practitioners to have access to the latest scientific information at the point of patient contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience most physicians actually want to be science-based, and they think that they are. They fall short because they lack the systems and resources to keep current. Some may be lazy too, but again that is a spectrum we are all on. No one is tireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that some physicians are just poorly trained, and develop bad habits of thought they carry throughout their careers. Physicians need to be taught more uniformly to think more critically, scientifically, and skeptically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor not mentioned by Begley is that for many medical decisions the available data is ambiguous. Regions develop their local standards of practice because ambiguous data allows them to. Where the data is more solid variation in practice decreases (I have seen this happen many times in my speciality). And another salient factor is that disease rates actually vary significantly from region to region, and this partly explains differences in procedure and treatment rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has Begley oversimplified her diagnosis, she recommends a specific remedy as if it is the only solution - CER. Last week &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=387"&gt;Val Jones wrote on SBM&lt;/a&gt; about the same problem in health care and recommended a completely different solution.  To summarize, CER is a top-down approach - you have a committee of experts decide what the science says about a specific medical situation and then impose practice standards from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Val was recommending a bottom-up approach - improve physician education about SBM and their access to needed information. She argues, and I agree, that physicians do not have to be forced by committee to do the right thing. If they know what the right thing is they will tend to do it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually think that both methods should be blended. For certain medical situations the evidence strongly supports certain interventions and their application is fairly straightforward. For those situations top-down practice standards make sense, to maximize compliance with best practices. This could still leave room for individualization of care but would make the default management the EBM standard. But for many other medical interventions the bottom-up approach is probably best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that whichever method is preferred, improved education and access to critical information is going to be very important to improving health outcomes and cost effectiveness in the future, and that information technology must play a central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Begley vs Tom Harkin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where the double standard comes in.  Everyone seems to agree that we need to make efforts to increase the degree to which doctors are science and evidence-based in their practice. We may disagree as to the causes and the best solutions, but everyone agrees that science is the answer. Some are even willing to put science-based doctors on a very short leash in order to make them even more science-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at the same time there is a completely separate conversation going on, as if it is taking place in a parallel universe, promoting the notion that so-called alternative practitioners should be freed from the shackles of scientific regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;David Gorski &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=396"&gt;Peter Lipson&lt;/a&gt; both wrote entries recently discussing Senator Tom Harkin’s hearing in which he invited some of the luminaries of the CAM movement to explain how healthcare reform can be hijacked to promote ideology, faith, sectarian practices, and the freedom to pursue profits unfettered by regulation over science-based medicine (OK, they didn’t put it exactly like that, but I think that is a fair summary). I won’t go over this terrain again, as David and Peter covered it nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Harkin is upset that his beloved CAM modalities are not meeting the standards of science, despite being given every unfair advantage and special consideration. Rather than concluding, as I think is reasonable, that this is because these CAM modalities do not work (which probably has something to do with why they are CAM in the first place), he concludes that they should be promoted and “integrated” into healthcare anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that when dealing with mainstream medicine the mantra is more and more regulation, oversight, and enforcement of standards. However, when dealing with so-called alternative medicine the mantra is more freedom and less regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a meaningful discussion of the relative roles of top-down regulation vs bottom-up education in improving science-based medicine is useful and even necessary.  I have my opinions, but no one really knows what the best balance of these two approaches will be. I therefore agree with those who call for outcome measures to monitor various efforts at improving quality control in medicine, so we can see what actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these efforts must be universal. They should not be applied to one subset of the healthcare industry and not to another. Yet the CAM movement has been amazingly successful at promoting a double-standard, where they are free from all such regulation and quality control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are to have an honest conversation in this country about quality control in medicine, these two parallel conversations need to be merged.  They can no longer continue to exist side-by-side in parallel universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I will write about another double-standard: pharmaceuticals vs supplements, and the new GAO report on supplement regulation by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a graduate student in my last year of studies.  At the end of the year I will have completed my Masters of Nursing/Nurse Practitioner.  I recently attended a scheduled lecture, and was rather upset to enter the lecture hall and learn of topic to be discussed: Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the topic for this lecture rather disturbing as the faculty which I attend prides itself on the utilization of evidence based practice and research.&lt;br&gt;
As is common knowledge to most skeptically minded individuals, CAM treatment modalities are not based on evidence based practice.  If fact one could easily argue that CAM treatment modalities are the exact opposite.  Despite a growing body of research that demonstrates the lack of efficacy or plausible mechanism of action of said treatments, the practices of CAM practitioners remain largely unchanged.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, the practices of evidence based medicine/healthcare change and evolve as new information/data/research becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAM therapies, as a general rule of thumb, do not change and evolve.  Instead they cling to treatments that have long been outdated and proven ineffective.  Instead of accepting this fact, and either altering their treatment patterns, changing the claims made for various treatment modalities, or discarding un-useful treatments entirely, CAM practitioners and researchers attempt to find new ways to explain how their treatment modalities work.  Additionally, much effort seems to be made attempting to explain why CAM therapies cannot be measured by “scientific standards” and are “beyond the scope of understanding of Western Medicine”.  Instead of participating in research to advance healthcare and the understanding of the human body, CAM practitioners/researchers instead propagate, in my humble opinion, an assault against logic, reason and rationale thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence based medicine/healthcare begins with a hypothesis (regarding a treatment modality) and then works to either prove or disprove that hypothesis.   Upon completely this process, practitioners/researchers make decisions regarding the mechanisms of action/efficacy of a treatment modality and that make appropriate alterations to the standard practice as required.  CAM on the other hand, starts with a conclusion, and then works backward from this conclusion.  The CAM practitioner/researcher has already decided that a treatment modality is effective and is attempting to prove it.  When a study concludes and shows the opposite, instead of questioning the efficacy or mechanism of a treatment modality, the CAM practitioner/researcher simply deems the study as flawed and discards the information.  Again, this does not to advance healthcare or the understanding of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the majority of my classmates did not share the above views.  I should clarify that, when I say majority of my classmates I mean “all”.  Not a single person in the class, besides myself, questioned the information that was being presented.   Not a single student questioned the presenter about the information that was being put forth.  No questions were asked regarding possible mechanisms of action or actual efficacy of treatment.   Upon asking such questions myself, I was met with much disdain and hostility towards my comments (despite my best efforts to come across in a non-inflammatory manner).  Reflecting back, I am not sure what is more disheartening, the fact that a faculty founded on evidence-based practice/research allowed such a lecture into the curriculum or that none of my fellow  students felt the need to question the information being presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the frustrations of the day and being bombarded with statements such as “there are simply some things which we cannot understand” and “maybe there are simply some things that cannot be measured” I did manage to learn something…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare professionals (and really all skeptics) must educate themselves about various pseudo-scientific topics.  Furthermore, healthcare professionals (and again, all skeptics) must be willing to discuss these topics with patients (or individuals) and be willing to educate people.  Not simply tell patients (individuals) what to think, but present these individuals with relevant information in order to facilitate the making of rationale decisions using critical thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, healthcare professionals (and again, skeptics) cannot assume that “someone else” is always going to “set-up” and “say something” in the face of pseudo-science.  We must assume that we are the only one in the room who can and will say something.  We must stand up for science and reason and not allow individuals such as CAM practitioners/researchers to make bogus claims that are, again in my humble opinion, an assault on science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;

Terrell Stepney was 19 years old and liked jigsaw puzzles---of Spider Man, it seems, and other subjects---P.E., and field trips. He lived with his grandparents in South Norfolk, Virginia and attended Oscar Smith High School.  Today's &lt;a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2009/03/student-killed-grandmother-liked-gym-field-trips"&gt;Virginia-Pilot&lt;/a&gt; reports that, late last week, Stepney's grandmother, 55-year-old Constance Stepney, &lt;a href="http://www.wvec.com/news/topstories/stories/wvec_local_030209_ches_autistic_death_grandma.1bc19b90.html"&gt;killed him&lt;/a&gt; with an overdose of prescription medication before taking an overdose of the same drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrell's grandfather, Larry Stepney, discovered both of them after trying to wake Terrell for school Friday morning, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrell, 19, was breathing irregularly, and Constance Stepney was unresponsive. Larry Stepney called 911, but it was too late for both of them. Constance Stepney, 55, was pronounced dead at their South Norfolk home, which sits in a cul-de-sac in the 3100 block of Ida Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medics took Terrell to Chesapeake Regional Medical Center. He was placed on life support but died Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police have closed the case. They offered no motive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's just a tragic story," said Paul Joseph, principal at Oscar Smith High School. "His classmates are a small, tight-knit group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much sadness here and so, too, many questions. What had happened to Terrell's parents? What  supports were in place and what was not? What, what, and why............. What aren't we doing, that  these stories---&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/mother_charged_in_daughters_death"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; too--- still keep happening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By altering just one gene in HIV-1, scientists have succeeded in infecting pig-tailed macaque monkeys with a human version of the virus that has until now been impossible to study directly in animals. The new strain of HIV has already been used to demonstrate one method for preventing infection and, with a little tweaking, could be a valuable model for vetting vaccine candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers led by Paul Bieniasz and Theodora Hatziioannou at The Rockefeller University showed that two pig-tailed macaques, given a common antiretroviral treatment one week before and one week after being exposed to the newly engineered HIV, had no signs of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 300-million-year-old brain of a relative of sharks and ratfish has been revealed by French and American scientists using synchrotron holotomography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). It is the first time that the soft tissue of such an old fossil brain has ever been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, for those keeping track, that’s 299,994,000 years before the existence of the whole universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

This of course makes the notion of a supernatural soul rather unnecessary and redundant. Sorry all you&lt;a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-Cartesiandualism.html"&gt; Cartesian dualists&lt;/a&gt; out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific data supports preexisting theories that abstract decisions about action take place in the front of the frontal lobe, the back portion controls the capacity for concrete decisions, and the progression from front to back forms a gradient from abstract to concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all sorts of nutty claims like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/stop-jenny-mccarthy/"&gt;vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/rugbyologist/festival_idiots_5_jenny_mccarthy_vaccines_chelation_and_autism_playmate_week_edition"&gt;she cured her son of autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/jenny-mccarthy-indigo-children-and.html"&gt;her son is an Indigo child&lt;/a&gt;, now Ms. McCarthy reveals this little gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love Botox, I absolutely love it,” she said. “I get it minimally, so I can still move my face. But I really do think it’s a savior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Plait sums up her position nicely &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/03/why-you-should-listen-to-celebrities/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see. So injecting kids with scientifically-proven medicine that can save their lives and the lives of countless others is &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; because of a fantasy-driven belief that it causes autism, but injecting a lethal pathogen — in fact, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"&gt;the most lethal protein known&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — into your face to help ease the globally threatening scourge of crow’s feet is just &lt;strong&gt;fine and dandy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s things like this that illustrate why we must Stop &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(It has seriously been a madhouse. No time to blog. I want to buy Street Fighter IV, but why waste the money when I wouldn't have time to play it?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtcounts.net/2009/02/skeptics-circle-105-the-shakespeare-edition/"&gt;The 105th Meeting of the Skeptics Circle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtcounts.net/"&gt;It's the Thought That Counts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.disillusionedwords.com/?p=1320"&gt;The 106th Meeting of the Skeptics Circle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.disillusionedwords.com/"&gt;Disillusioned Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, now that that's out of the way, onto the second thing: miscellena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still haven't found a way to cut together my footage of my Bigfoot hunt from a few weeks back. It sounds like Quicktime Pro is the best way for me to go, but I don't want to pay for that just to edit down a single video. I'll be working on the problem and it'll be ready when it's ready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The major reason I've been so absent is school. It's midterm season, and I've had an exam each of the last 2 weeks, with another next week. I've found that in my primate biology and archaeology of the Near East classes especially, I'm learning things that are almost entirely new to me, and that makes them somewhat more difficult to retain. They don't fit nicely into a pre-existing knowledge framework; the new information has no referent in my head to which it can draw an association and thus stick around. I've been forging entirely new neural pathways to remember taxonomic hierarchies and historical eras and periods. But I have learned a few interesting things in the last couple of weeks, and I thought I'd put a few down on the off-chance that someone else finds them interesting. You can stop reading if you already know these things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Sargon the Great, founder of the Akkadian Empire, usurped power in a city named Kish before conquering enough territory to become the world's first real emperor. Sargon was the name he took after his power grab. We don't know what his name was before that. "Sargon" translates as "legitimate king." Now that takes balls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Sargon's official life story has him born to a priestess who couldn't keep him so she put him in a reed basket and sent him down a river. He was found and raised outside his real family and eventually came to power. Sound familiar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- One of the primary ways of distinguishing different types of primates (at various levels in the taxonomy) is the shape of their noses. Weird.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The !Kung bushmen of southern Africa lived as hunter-gatherers continuously for perhaps 10,000 years until white people showed up and started fucking with them. Not once during those 10,000 years did a one of them say "Hmm...This healing trance thing we're doing to cure people doesn't have a very high success rate. Is there anything we could be doing differently?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- I think saying the above makes me ethnocentric. Oh well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bigfoot post coming soon, hopefully!&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-4462596137263939196?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236148270540"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/04/a-teaching-moment-angels-demons/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a760e4b08c1613f7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><title type="html">A Teaching Moment:  Angels &amp;amp; Demons</title><published>2009-03-04T06:25:09Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T06:25:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/04/a-teaching-moment-angels-demons/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;May 15 will be the premiere of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Demons_(film)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Ron Howard movie starring Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer, based on the Dan Brown novel.   The narrative moves between particle physics at CERN and religious politics at the Vatican — feel free to provide your own characterization of that particular binary opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressReleases/Releases2009/PR03.09E.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/0902014_06-a5-at-72-dpi.jpg" alt="Angels &amp;amp; Demons at CERN" width="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no idea how good the movie is going to be, but it’s sure to garner attention, and it does feature physics prominently.  So the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society figures that we might as well get some mileage out of it.  They recently sent around the email below, encouraging physics departments to host “Angels &amp;amp; Demons lecture nights” to capitalize on the interest generated by the movie.  Seems like a good idea to me — rather than spending energy finding flaws in the physics as portrayed in the movie (which are sure to be there), let’s grab the opportunity to spread the word about some exciting science that’s being done in the real world.  If nothing else, the most common question about the LHC will change from “Will it make a black hole that will destroy the world?” to “Will it make an anti-matter bomb that could destroy the Vatican?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This May, Sony Pictures will release Angels and Demons, a movie based&lt;br&gt;
on Dan Brown’s best-selling novel that focuses on an apparent plot to&lt;br&gt;
destroy the Vatican using a small amount of antimatter. In the book&lt;br&gt;
and the movie, that antimatter gets stolen from CERN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starring Tom Hanks and directed by Ron Howard, parts of the movie were&lt;br&gt;
actually filmed at CERN. It’s not every day that a major motion&lt;br&gt;
picture places particle physics in the spotlight. The US particle&lt;br&gt;
physics community would like to take advantage of this opportunity to&lt;br&gt;
tell the world about the science behind the movie, the Large Hadron&lt;br&gt;
Collider and the excitement of particle physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, the Fermilab, SLAC and US LHC users organizations&lt;br&gt;
will join forces to organize Angels and Demons public lecture nights&lt;br&gt;
at universities or other venues across the country when the movie&lt;br&gt;
premieres in mid-May. While each institution will be responsible for&lt;br&gt;
the local logistics of planning the public lecture, the Fermilab&lt;br&gt;
Office of Communications and the CERN Press Office can help. A Web&lt;br&gt;
page on the US LHC Web site (&lt;a href="http://www.uslhc.us/Angels_Demons"&gt;http://www.uslhc.us/Angels_Demons&lt;/a&gt;) will&lt;br&gt;
provide you with materials that will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- a template PowerPoint talk, for your use if helpful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- a template poster to advertise the lecture at your institution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- tips on answering tough questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- information on how to broadcast the lecture on the Web&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to host a lecture, please contact Elizabeth Clements&lt;br&gt;
(lizzie@fnal.gov) or Katie Yurkewicz (katie@fnal.gov). They will give&lt;br&gt;
you more information and help you with publicity for your event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the movie contains a great deal that is not about science,&lt;br&gt;
physics is central to its plot. This makes it possible for US&lt;br&gt;
physicists to lecture on the science behind the movie, the Large&lt;br&gt;
Hadron Collider and particle physics in general. The physics at the&lt;br&gt;
heart of Angels and Demons–the potential destruction of the Vatican&lt;br&gt;
by a small chunk of antimatter–calls attention to what happens when&lt;br&gt;
matter and antimatter meet. This in turn calls attention to the fact&lt;br&gt;
that the absence of practically any antimatter in the universe is&lt;br&gt;
crucial to our existence. To understand that absence is one of the big&lt;br&gt;
challenges of particle physics. Public lectures could discuss the&lt;br&gt;
challenge of the missing antimatter, possible solutions and how&lt;br&gt;
experiments in both the intensity and energy frontiers will explore&lt;br&gt;
these mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to allow enough time to plan and advertise the lecture at&lt;br&gt;
your institution, the time to get started is now. We hope that you&lt;br&gt;
will make the most of this wonderful opportunity to get the public&lt;br&gt;
excited about particle physics and the many anticipated discoveries&lt;br&gt;
that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris Kayser, Chair&lt;br&gt;
Division of Particles and Fields&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3327040815/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3290/3327040815_f12a5833fe.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturn’s G ring is the second outermost ring (one more ring, E, is outside G, but very wide and diffuse). It’s about 8000 km (5000 miles) wide, orbiting Saturn about 165,000 km (100,000 miles) out from the planet. It’s mostly dust, which was a mystery: there was no moon associated with it to replenish the dust, the only ring like it around Saturn without such a source. These new images (click to emringen) clearly show there is a moon there indeed, though it hardly qualifies with such a grandiose name: it’s only about 500 meters (600 yards) across. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These images were taken over about ten minutes, with each image being a 46 second exposure. The camera was tracking on the ring, so the stars appear as streaks. The moonlet can be seen to be embedded in the ring, and moving with it. That makes it clearly part of the G ring, and the obvious long-sought source of dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the left image is in visible light, the middle in red, and the right in near-infrared. Taking images at different wavelengths (colors) like that gives astronomers insight in the composition of the ring material — ice and dust reflect light very differently, so looking at the relative brightnesses of the ring in different wavelengths can distinguish what material is in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very cool thing: scientists predicted the moonlet was present because they had studied other rings and knew there had to be something in there making the dust particles, so they went looking for it, and bang! They found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s science. Observation, hypothesis, test, result. A billion kilometers from Earth, and science still works. That’s one of the many reasons I like it so much. That, plus it’s simply so cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;…had “loose morals” and were rightfully shot by male relatives in honor killings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If a woman runs around and if a man runs around with her, both of them are killed,” Kadyrov told journalists in the capital of this Russian republic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old former militia leader is trying to impose Islamic values and strengthen traditional customs in predominantly Muslim Chechnya, aiming to blunt the appeal of hardline Islamic separatists and shore up his power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These women were victims of religion.&lt;br&gt;

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, one for our new &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pone.c01.i02" title=""&gt;Palaeontology Collection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004591" title=""&gt;Bird-Like Anatomy, Posture, and Behavior Revealed by an Early Jurassic Theropod Dinosaur Resting Trace&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fossil tracks made by non-avian theropod dinosaurs commonly reflect the habitual bipedal stance retained in living birds. Only rarely-captured behaviors, such as crouching, might create impressions made by the hands. Such tracks provide valuable information concerning the often poorly understood functional morphology of the early theropod forelimb. Here we describe a well-preserved theropod trackway in a Lower Jurassic (~198 million-year-old) lacustrine beach sandstone in the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation in southwestern Utah. The trackway consists of prints of typical morphology, intermittent tail drags and, unusually, traces made by the animal resting on the substrate in a posture very similar to modern birds. The resting trace includes symmetrical pes impressions and well-defined impressions made by both hands, the tail, and the ischial callosity. The manus impressions corroborate that early theropods, like later birds, held their palms facing medially, in contrast to manus prints previously attributed to theropods that have forward-pointing digits. Both the symmetrical resting posture and the medially-facing palms therefore evolved by the Early Jurassic, much earlier in the theropod lineage than previously recognized, and may characterize all theropods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004678" title=""&gt;An Indicator of the Impact of Climatic Change on European Bird Populations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rapid climatic change poses a threat to global biodiversity. There is extensive evidence that recent climatic change has affected animal and plant populations, but no indicators exist that summarise impacts over many species and large areas. We use data on long-term population trends of European birds to develop such an indicator. We find a significant relationship between interspecific variation in population trend and the change in potential range extent between the late 20th and late 21st centuries, forecasted by climatic envelope models. Our indicator measures divergence in population trend between bird species predicted by climatic envelope models to be favourably affected by climatic change and those adversely affected. The indicator shows a rapid increase in the past twenty years, coinciding with a period of rapid warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004694" title=""&gt;Serial Position Learning in Honeybees&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Learning of stimulus sequences is considered as a characteristic feature of episodic memory since it contains not only a particular item but also the experience of preceding and following events. In sensorimotor tasks resembling navigational performance, the serial order of objects is intimately connected with spatial order. Mammals and birds develop episodic(-like) memory in serial spatio-temporal tasks, and the honeybee learns spatio-temporal order when navigating between the nest and a food source. Here I examine the structure of the bees' memory for a combined spatio-temporal task. I ask whether discrimination and generalization are based solely on simple forms of stimulus-reward learning or whether they require sequential configurations. Animals were trained to fly either left or right in a continuous T-maze. The correct choice was signaled by the sequence of colors (blue, yellow) at four positions in the access arm. If only one of the possible 4 signals is shown (either blue or yellow), the rank order of position salience is 1, 2 and 3 (numbered from T-junction). No learning is found if the signal appears at position 4. If two signals are shown, differences at positions 1 and 2 are learned best, those at position 3 at a low level, and those at position 4 not at all. If three or more signals are shown these results are corroborated. This salience rank order again appeared in transfer tests, but additional configural phenomena emerged. Most of the results can be explained with a simple model based on the assumption that the four positions are equipped with different salience scores and that these add up independently. However, deviations from the model are interpreted by assuming stimulus configuration of sequential patterns. It is concluded that, under the conditions chosen, bees rely most strongly on memories developed during simple forms of associative reward learning, but memories of configural serial patterns contribute, too.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004698" title=""&gt;Genetic Structure of the Polymorphic Metrosideros (Myrtaceae) Complex in the Hawaiian Islands Using Nuclear Microsatellite Data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Five species of Metrosideros (Myrtaceae) are recognized in the Hawaiian Islands, including the widespread M. polymorpha, and are characterized by a multitude of distinctive, yet overlapping, habit, ecological, and morphological forms. It remains unclear, despite several previous studies, whether the morphological variation within Hawaiian Metrosideros is due to hybridization, genetic polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, or some combination of these processes. The Hawaiian Metrosideros complex has become a model system to study ecology and evolution; however this is the first study to use microsatellite data for addressing inter-island patterns of variation from across the Hawaiian Islands. Ten nuclear microsatellite loci were genotyped from 143 individuals of Metrosideros. We took advantage of the bi-parental inheritance and rapid mutation rate of these data to examine the validity of the current taxonomy and to investigate whether Metrosideros plants from the same island are more genetically similar than plants that are morphologically similar. The Bayesian algorithm of the program STRUCTURE was used to define genetic groups within Hawaiian Metrosideros and the closely related taxon M. collina from the Marquesas and Austral Islands. Several standard and nested AMOVAs were conducted to test whether the genetic diversity is structured geographically or taxonomically. The results suggest that Hawaiian Metrosideros have dynamic gene flow, with genetic and morphological diversity structured not simply by geography or taxonomy, but as a result of parallel evolution on islands following rampant island-island dispersal, in addition to ancient chloroplast capture. Results also suggest that the current taxonomy requires major revisions in order to reflect the genetic structure revealed in the microsatellite data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004688" title=""&gt;Big Genomes Facilitate the Comparative Identification of Regulatory Elements&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The identification of regulatory sequences in animal genomes remains a significant challenge. Comparative genomic methods that use patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify non-coding sequences with regulatory function have yielded many new vertebrate enhancers. However, these methods have not contributed significantly to the identification of regulatory sequences in sequenced invertebrate taxa. We demonstrate here that this differential success, which is often attributed to fundamental differences in the nature of vertebrate and invertebrate regulatory sequences, is instead primarily a product of the relatively small size of sequenced invertebrate genomes. We sequenced and compared loci involved in early embryonic patterning from four species of true fruit flies (family Tephritidae) that have genomes four to six times larger than those of Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike in Drosophila, where virtually all non-coding DNA is highly conserved, blocks of conserved non-coding sequence in tephritids are flanked by large stretches of poorly conserved sequence, similar to what is observed in vertebrate genomes. We tested the activities of nine conserved non-coding sequences flanking the even-skipped gene of the teprhitid Ceratis capitata in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos, six of which drove patterns that recapitulate those of known D. melanogaster enhancers. In contrast, none of the three non-conserved tephritid non-coding sequences that we tested drove expression in D. melanogaster embryos. Based on the landscape of non-coding conservation in tephritids, and our initial success in using conservation in tephritids to identify D. melanogaster regulatory sequences, we suggest that comparison of tephritid genomes may provide a systematic means to annotate the non-coding portion of the D. melanogaster genome. We also propose that large genomes be given more consideration in the selection of species for comparative genomics projects, to provide increased power to detect functional non-coding DNAs and to provide a less biased view of the evolution and function of animal genomes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004638" title=""&gt;Lip-Reading Aids Word Recognition Most in Moderate Noise: A Bayesian Explanation Using High-Dimensional Feature Space&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Watching a speaker's facial movements can dramatically enhance our ability to comprehend words, especially in noisy environments. From a general doctrine of combining information from different sensory modalities (the principle of inverse effectiveness), one would expect that the visual signals would be most effective at the highest levels of auditory noise. In contrast, we find, in accord with a recent paper, that visual information improves performance more at intermediate levels of auditory noise than at the highest levels, and we show that a novel visual stimulus containing only temporal information does the same. We present a Bayesian model of optimal cue integration that can explain these conflicts. In this model, words are regarded as points in a multidimensional space and word recognition is a probabilistic inference process. When the dimensionality of the feature space is low, the Bayesian model predicts inverse effectiveness; when the dimensionality is high, the enhancement is maximal at intermediate auditory noise levels. When the auditory and visual stimuli differ slightly in high noise, the model makes a counterintuitive prediction: as sound quality increases, the proportion of reported words corresponding to the visual stimulus should first increase and then decrease. We confirm this prediction in a behavioral experiment. We conclude that auditory-visual speech perception obeys the same notion of optimality previously observed only for simple multisensory stimuli.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one from yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004668" title=""&gt;A Genome Wide Survey of SNP Variation Reveals the Genetic Structure of Sheep Breeds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The genetic structure of sheep reflects their domestication and subsequent formation into discrete breeds. Understanding genetic structure is essential for achieving genetic improvement through genome-wide association studies, genomic selection and the dissection of quantitative traits. After identifying the first genome-wide set of SNP for sheep, we report on levels of genetic variability both within and between a diverse sample of ovine populations. Then, using cluster analysis and the partitioning of genetic variation, we demonstrate sheep are characterised by weak phylogeographic structure, overlapping genetic similarity and generally low differentiation which is consistent with their short evolutionary history. The degree of population substructure was, however, sufficient to cluster individuals based on geographic origin and known breed history. Specifically, African and Asian populations clustered separately from breeds of European origin sampled from Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North America. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of stratification within some, but not all, ovine breeds. The results emphasize that careful documentation of genetic structure will be an essential prerequisite when mapping the genetic basis of complex traits. Furthermore, the identification of a subset of SNP able to assign individuals into broad groupings demonstrates even a small panel of markers may be suitable for applications such as traceability.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pushed by scientists everywhere, the NIH and other government agencies were increasingly exploring this obviously better model for spreading knowledge. Proprietary publishers, however, didn't like it. And so rather than competing in the traditional way, they've adopted the increasingly Washington way of competition -- they've gone to Congress to get a law to ban the business model they don't like. If H.R. 801 is passed, the government can't even experiment with supporting publishing models that assure that the people who have paid for the research can actually access it. Instead, if Conyers has his way, we'll pay for the research twice.

&lt;p&gt;The insanity in this proposal is brilliantly described by Jamie Boyle in this piece in the FT. But after you read his peace, you'll be even more puzzled by this. For what possible reason could Conyers have for supporting a bill that 33 Nobel Prize Winners, and the current and former heads of the NIH say will actually hurt scientific research in America? More pointedly, what possible reason would a man from a district that insists on the government "Buying American" have for supporting a bill that basically subsidizes foreign publishers (for the biggest players in this publishing market are non-American firms, making HR 801 a kind of "Foreign Publishers Protection Act")?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well no one can know what goes on the heart or mind of Congressman Conyers. But what we do know is what MAPLight.org published yesterday: That the co-sponsors of this bill who sit on the Judiciary Committee received on average two-times the amount of money from publishing interests as those who haven't co-sponsored the bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/lawrence-lessig-answers-your-questions-on-copyright-corruption-and-congress/" title=""&gt;Lawrence Lessig Answers Your Questions on Copyright, Corruption, and Congress&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A decade's work against IP extremism taught me two things: first, that people -- teachers, parents, archivists, entrepreneurs, and many many artists -- recognized the insanity in the current war; and second, that members of Congress didn't even understand the issue. Some say that's because they're clueless. I don't think that's right. Instead, I believe Congress doesn't get it because it cares less about making sense of copyright policy and more about raising dollars for political campaigns. When you recognize (as it took me way too long to recognize) that this is the same in a wide range of public policy contexts, including some of the most important (e.g., global warming), you realize the root cause here -- corruption -- is the problem that has to be addressed.

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the big story that the press doesn't cover well is just how ordinary the corruption of government is. The serious problem, in my view, is not members using government to feather their own nests (though as one member put it to me, Congress has become a "farm league for K St.," which is extremely serious). The most serious problem is instead good people living in a corrupt system. In my view, these "good people" have a moral obligation to change this corrupt system. They have a moral obligation to take a stand against it. We have seen enough to see just how much harm this system is producing. To stand by and let it continue -- indeed, to encourage it to continue in its current form -- is an act of extraordinary cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessig is urging people to &lt;a href="http://change-congress.org/?partner=conyers_bb" title=""&gt;take action here&lt;/a&gt; -- joining his reform organization's 'donor strike' to pressure Congress to fix the underlying corrupt system that resulted in Conyers doing what he did. After you sign, they'll email you a number to call your representative in Congress (and Conyers) about this specific bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/lawrence_lessig_on_open_access.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/agVc57JdGLM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236125055550"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ben_x_and_bullying">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f57c37da8d75b373</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">"Ben X" and Bullying</title><published>2009-03-04T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T00:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ben_x_and_bullying" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevenfernandez/2370347860/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/2370347860_e4ea8835a3_m.jpg" alt="a teenage boy sits in front of a row of school lockers, one of them open and a backpack and lunch bag litter the ground; he holds his head in his hands" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Belgian movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0953318/"&gt;Ben X&lt;/a&gt; got a mixed review from &lt;a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20090227/ENT/702279966"&gt;from the Herald (WA)&lt;/a&gt;.  The main theme of the movie is school bullying of an AS teen.  The review notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The melodrama of this is heavy, but Balthazar has a cause. He also wrote the novel the film is based on, and was inspired by a true story of a 17-year-old autistic boy from Brussels who committed suicide after being bullied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullying is an enormous problem in schools and elsewhere; difference is rarely treated kindly by the mainstream.  Bullying can cause mental health problems such as loss of self-esteem and severe depression.  People on the spectrum may be vulnerable to bullying in more than one way: because they are different from "the norm," because they may not understand the bulling is happening until a later time, because they may not be able to communicate that bulling is happening, and because they may not be believed about the bullying or have appropriate action taken if they do report it (among other possible issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Prince-Hughes writes poignantly about her bulling experiences in her book &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TlwsAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;q=Songs+of+the+Gorilla+Nation&amp;amp;dq=Songs+of+the+Gorilla+Nation&amp;amp;ei=B46tSaC6F6OMkQSCib2XBQ&amp;amp;pgis=1"&gt;Songs of the Gorilla Nation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People would corner me in the bathroom and force my head into the toilet, slam me into my locker, and throw trash at me in the hall.  They hit me in the head with books and spit on me.  They defaced my locker.  They took my food away.  One of the senior students made a sign with a derogatory word on it and hung it around my neck.  I didn't take it off. To me, the words people shouted at me, their thoughts about me being crazy, the ways they treated me, were all as real as the sign, and I couldn't take them off.  I was swimming in a sea of ugliness, hate, and intolerance; what good would it do to remove a cardboard sign. I didn't have the energy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullying isn't just reserved for so-called "peers" either--teachers also may participate in the bullying.  Also in &lt;em&gt;Songs of the Gorilla Nation&lt;/em&gt; Dawn Prince Hughes relates being so abused by a teacher that she began going into a dissociative state when the teacher interacted with her.  She says, "I never told my parents about it.  It didn't occur to me that I could communicate about things that happened.  I simply wasn't able to understand that use of words."  Unfortunately, actions like &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/should_wendy_portillo_still_be_teaching"&gt;Wendy Portillo&lt;/a&gt;'s are not as rare as one might hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the movie "Ben X" is worth viewing, the issue of school bullying is definitely worth examining.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236123221075"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-7094538059632447094">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a6d977295051086f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">MedPod101 Repeats Standard Line</title><published>2009-03-03T16:11:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T16:11:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/03/medpod101-repeats-standard-line.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">I listen to MedPod 101 - it's a podcast on medicine that is quite often dorky with silly voices and skits, but there is usually quality information in there.  Recently, however, they've been doing some shows on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) with more leniency that I'm comfortable with.  Their show on homeopathy was &lt;i&gt;alright&lt;/i&gt;, but it ended with the presenter saying that he'd refer to a homeopath if he thought that his patient could benefit from a placebo.  He said that he'd be responsible and tell the patient that there's no scientific evidence to support homeopathy, but it might be something they'd be interested in checking out.  If the patient proceeded to go and try it, so be it, and hopefully they'd benefit from the placebo.  After all, as &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html"&gt;Andrew Weil&lt;/a&gt; said, "a placebo won't harm anyone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hate that line.  The old &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html"&gt;what's the harm&lt;/a&gt; canard.  I hope the medpod folks go to that site and read about the harm that believing in fairy tales can do.  I find it staggering that the students in med. schools (and the graduates who are practicing on people) buy into something as ludicrous as homeopathy.  It saddens me.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/mccarthy_syringe_med.jpg" alt="Jenny McCarthy, shot"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It brings me no end of wonderment that anyone would listen to anything Jenny McCarthy says. Our evolved instinct to obey authority — if you sit still when the tribe leader yells &amp;quot;run!&amp;quot; you’re likely to become saber-tooth tiger nosh, and are unlikely to contribute to the gene pool — is clearly to blame here. Still, we also have large and I’m guessing generally unused portions of our brains which are built to override such foolish impulses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, Ms. McCarthy is something of a celebrity. She’s very pretty, attracting attention, and is actually very funny (yes, I have a sophomoric sense of humor sometimes), so it’s no surprise people might be tempted to listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what she says is so mind-numbingly mind numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/stop-jenny-mccarthy/"&gt;Vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/rugbyologist/festival_idiots_5_jenny_mccarthy_vaccines_chelation_and_autism_playmate_week_edition"&gt;She cured her son of autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2007/09/jenny-mccarthy-indigo-children-and.html"&gt;Her son is an Indigo child&lt;/a&gt;. And so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://omg.yahoo.com/news/jenny-mccarthy-on-playboy-botox-husband-jim-carrey/19433?nc"&gt;Her latest&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love Botox, I absolutely love it,” she said. “I get it minimally, so I can still move my face. But I really do think it’s a savior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see. So injecting kids with scientifically-proven medicine that can save their lives and the lives of countless others is &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; because of a fantasy-driven belief that it causes autism, but injecting a lethal pathogen — in fact, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"&gt;the most lethal protein known&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — into your face to help ease the globally threatening scourge of crow’s feet is just &lt;strong&gt;fine and dandy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, say: can you excuse me a second? I need to go over here for a sec …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aaaaiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Special license plates for vehicles cost more, and proceeds from them are donated to whatever cause the custom plate promotes--in this case autism-related recreational programs.  The article describes the plates as "a mini billboard for autism" (actual billboards, blessedly, are illegal in Maine making the scenery there much easier on the eyes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of using custom license plates to generate revenue for social programs sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slogan "give autism a hand" however may sound to some a little odd.  Isn't it more precisely, "give autistic people a hand" or "give autism recreation programs a hand?"  The idea of a "mini billboard for autism" may have a similar problem.  Does "autism" need advertising or do programs and services for people on the autism spectrum, and the skills and talents of people on the autism spectrum, need the advertising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that matter, is advertising an entire minority class of people on one's car appropriate?

&lt;p&gt;Not so happy about the new slogan.  To be helpful, I tried to think of alternatives, but no love there since I have a tiny, cold, black heart and can only think of things like “San Diego: We’re Broke” and “San Diego: Close to Mexico”  (the latter, of course, geographically true, and yet, not so catchy).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental question is this: can the wisdom of crowds be exploited to post-filter the literature?

&lt;p&gt;--------------snip------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lioness doesn't bother eating individual blades of grass - she lets the antelopes do that drudgery, and then she eats the antelopes. It is similarly tempting to assign the post-filtering task to hordes of enthusiastic volunteers - intrepid, pajama-clad souls, armed only with keyboards and search engines, who would wade through the jungle of the literature and return to us only the choicest prizes. But this is a fantasy. For bloggers to provide an efficient and efficacious post-filter service, they would have to meet an imposing list of qualifications: sufficiently well-trained to make wise judgments about the papers most worthy of attention; sufficiently idle to have nothing better to do than read papers all day; free of idiosyncrasy or agenda that might bias their choices; and willing to work continuously for free. (In other words, there won't be 'hordes'.) Add to that the need for competition between bloggers -comparative prestige being the coin of that murky realm - and soon we'll find ourselves combing through myriad blogs in order to make sure we're reading the best one. And then we'll write a column about the need to post-filter the blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris, on his blog, &lt;a href="http://ouroboros.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/in-which-i-kick-my-own-ass/" title=""&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously I wouldn't blog if I thought it were totally pointless, but I have come to believe that even the most well-intentioned scientific bloggers are probably not going to be able to revolutionize their colleagues' relationship with the literature. In part, as we say in the excerpted passage, this is because it's unlikely that a single individual will rarely have both the relevant expertise and the required amount of free time. But are also other reasons, the most important one being that "one size does not fit all", e.g., any given blogger's survey of the recent literature involves judgment calls about what is interesting and important, which may or may not correspond with the judgments that would be made by any given individual reader.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/how_to_filter_all_that_enormou.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/XyGEqS_SWQY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236108776533"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/03/holey-costume/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4b03f77ee43f581</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Holey costume</title><published>2009-03-03T19:31:45Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T19:31:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/03/holey-costume/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wondering what kind of costume I should wear when I go to Dragon*Con later this year, &lt;a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2009/02/its_a_little_early_holey_hallo.php"&gt;and maybe I’ve found one&lt;/a&gt;.

It contained a small set of yawningly familiar arguments. I haven&amp;#39;t heard of these brave Christians actually attended the lecture or tried to ask these in the Q&amp;amp;A (I would be surprised if they did — I had someone try this stunt at one of my talks, and not only did they run away without listening, but everyone who saw the questions on the handout just laughed at them), but I thought I&amp;#39;d take a quick stab at how I&amp;#39;d address them if I were handed that piece of paper. I&amp;#39;ve put a short version of their long-winded questions here — see the link for the complete version — and my brief reply, although I&amp;#39;d actually be tempted to just laugh and shoo the goofy kook away around about the second question.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there an objective truth (and where did it come from)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an objective truth that we discern by studying the natural world, and by constantly subjecting hypotheses about its nature to testing. That nature is not separate from its existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does evolution obey the second law of thermodynamics?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, and you've already descended into ignorant idiocy with your second question. There is nothing in evolution that violates the laws of physics or chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the statistical probabilities of life evolving from non-life, and the accidental evolution of a single strand of DNA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.0. Life exists. What you're really trying to claim, in your clumsy and unschooled way, is that you think evolution argues that the extant complexity of the biosphere emerged in one abrupt accident. It did not, and if it did, it would be an exceedingly unlikely event. It would be creationism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does the existence of God make Dawkins so angry, and how can a scientist say with absolute confidence that there is no god?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins is not angry at the existence of god, nor am I. We are a bit peeved at intrusive nitwits like yourself who try to impose your quaint superstitions on others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, you apparently have not read Dawkins' book (which is ironic in light of the next question), since he does not claim with absolute confidence that there is no god. I will go further, however, and claim with absolute confidence that &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; have no good evidence for any god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Assorted Jesus babble and bible quotes] Have you ever read the Bible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;snort&amp;gt; Yes. It&amp;#39;s an incoherent collection of delusional muck, cobbled together by generations of priests trying to promote the status of their tribe and their role within it. It contains brief sparks of literary brilliance, but mostly, it&amp;#39;s garbage. And the whole Jesus story is illogical nonsense that no rational person should accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the whole problem with bothering to argue with these people is that they won't accept any of the answers, and will just start repeating the questions at you, at greater length. I've been on that merry-go-round before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/fleas_flock_to_dawkins_lecture.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pnGP2_347PM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236105775161"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4123">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b2e60e7e1164778</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="eric morris" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="LA: Fact and Fiction" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="Los Angeles" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="myths" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="transit" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">Los Angeles Transportation Facts and Fiction: Transit</title><published>2009-03-03T18:41:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T18:54:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/los-angeles-transportation-facts-and-fiction-transit/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/los-angeles-transportation-facts-and-fiction-transit/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/los-angeles-transportation-facts-and-fiction-transit/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">Photo: ceeb Inside a Los Angeles bus.

The article describes the plates as "a mini billboard for autism" (actual billboards, blessedly, are illegal in Maine making the scenery there much easier on the eyes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of using custom license plates to generate revenue for social programs sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slogan "give autism a hand" however may sound to some a little odd.  Isn't it more precisely, "give autistic people a hand" or "give autism recreation programs a hand?"  The idea of a "mini billboard for autism" may have a similar problem.  Does "autism" need advertising or do programs and services for people on the autism spectrum, and the skills and talents of people on the autism spectrum, need the advertising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that matter, is advertising an entire minority class of people on one's car appropriate?

As it should happen, both of the stories focus on women. Joy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4803286/Shopping-isthrowback-to-days-of-cavewomen.html"&gt;have women evolved to enjoy shopping&lt;/a&gt;? This may be a question that none of you ever considered, because you’re smarter than that, but nonetheless it is a question that appealed greatly to one particular group of people: namely, the Manchester Arndale Shopping Centre. Certain corporations have learned that an easy way to get your name in the news is to pay a scientist of relatively low integrity to crunch some numbers, fudge some facts, and publicize some stupid bullshit made-up “research” that somehow benefits the client. It’s advertising, but with a sciencey glow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s advertology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Lafsky at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2009/03/02/worst-science-article-ever-women-evolved-to-love-shopping/"&gt;the DiscoBlog skewered this particular example&lt;/a&gt;, calling it possibly the worst science article ever, which is really saying something. Melissa points out that while the “study” refers to “humans” evolving, the article makes it clear we’re talking about women, as evidenced by the headline (”throwback to days of cavewomen”), subhead, and accompanying photo (a woman gaping at a shop window). The errors in the short piece are numerous, including calling Neanderthals our ancestors and suggesting they somehow taught us something that is apparently instinctual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you feel that? It was the intelligence of all humanity, dropping ever so slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that article is shockingly terrible, more depressing yet is the buzz surrounding the recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html?_r=2&amp;amp;emc=eta1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;What do women want&lt;/a&gt;, about female sex researchers who study other women. The article was roundly criticized by many scientists due to its oversimplification of sex research and poorly supported conclusion, which hints that women as a whole are a giant bundle of mysterious inconsistencies – of course, as &lt;a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2009/01/24/what-do-these-enigmati-women-want/"&gt;Neuroanthropology.net&lt;/a&gt; points out, the same conclusion could be drawn after seeking out the answer to the question “What do diners want?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go read the Neuroanthropology article for the full, excellent critique of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s where it gets worse: many sex researchers openly criticized the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, and the popularity of the discussion prompted the UK’s &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; to print a similar piece. A journalist with the Sunday Times reached out to local researchers for their input, including Dr. Petra Boynton, a social psychologist. Despite previous disappointments with journalists, Dr. Boynton enjoyed speaking with the media and was glad for the chance to correct the problems in the NY Times article. She took great pains to lay out her concerns, and invited her colleagues to send information to the journalist in the hopes that she might gain a comprehensive perspective on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough. The Sunday Times printed a duplicate of the NY Times article, including nothing but a few sentences that completely misrepresented Dr. Boynton’s work and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Boynton was understandably upset. &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/?p=806"&gt;On her blog&lt;/a&gt;, she posted an excellent (yet ultimately heartbreaking) essay describing the events in detail, ending with a breakdown of how this hurts everyone: misquoting her and misrepresenting her research puts her job at risk, the public is misled about sex research, and scientists everywhere take note that in the future, they cannot trust journalists to do a thorough job, so why bother dealing with them at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kills me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do? All I want is the opportunity to share good sex science with the public in ways that helps them understand their lives. I have to do this with journalists a lot of the time, but each time something like this happens I wonder if my colleagues who don’t get involved with the press have a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really feel the time has come for to stop trying to explain sex research to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Boyle was and is exactly the kind of scientist the public needs: someone who is smart, savvy, and for ten years was willing to work with the media to convey a story. It’s tragic to lose someone like that due to journalistic incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day there are more layoffs at mainstream media outlets, making matters worse as good journalists are fired in favor of cheaper, less knowledgeable staff. Hell, a few months ago &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/cnn_cuts_entire_science_tech_t.php"&gt;CNN cut their entire science and tech department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is this where the Internet saves the day, with blogs picking up the slack and somehow informing the public despite the present lack of sustainable funding?

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4803286/Shopping-isthrowback-to-days-of-cavewomen.html"&gt;have women evolved to enjoy shopping&lt;/a&gt;? This may be a question that none of you ever considered, because you’re smarter than that, but nonetheless it is a question that appealed greatly to one particular group of people: namely, the Manchester Arndale Shopping Centre. Certain corporations have learned that an easy way to get your name in the news is to pay a scientist of relatively low integrity to crunch some numbers, fudge some facts, and publicize some stupid bullshit made-up “research” that somehow benefits the client. It’s advertising, but with a sciencey glow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s advertology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa Lafsky at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2009/03/02/worst-science-article-ever-women-evolved-to-love-shopping/"&gt;the DiscoBlog skewered this particular example&lt;/a&gt;, calling it possibly the worst science article ever, which is really saying something. Melissa points out that while the “study” refers to “humans” evolving, the article makes it clear we’re talking about women, as evidenced by the headline (”throwback to days of cavewomen”), subhead, and accompanying photo (a woman gaping at a shop window). The errors in the short piece are numerous, including calling Neanderthals our ancestors and suggesting they somehow taught us something that is apparently instinctual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you feel that? It was the intelligence of all humanity, dropping ever so slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though that article is shockingly terrible, more depressing yet is the buzz surrounding the recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html?_r=2&amp;amp;emc=eta1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;What do women want&lt;/a&gt;, about female sex researchers who study other women. The article was roundly criticized by many scientists due to its oversimplification of sex research and poorly supported conclusion, which hints that women as a whole are a giant bundle of mysterious inconsistencies – of course, as &lt;a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2009/01/24/what-do-these-enigmati-women-want/"&gt;Neuroanthropology.net&lt;/a&gt; points out, the same conclusion could be drawn after seeking out the answer to the question “What do diners want?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go read the Neuroanthropology article for the full, excellent critique of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s where it gets worse: many sex researchers openly criticized the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, and the popularity of the discussion prompted the UK’s &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; to print a similar piece. A journalist with the Sunday Times reached out to local researchers for their input, including Dr. Petra Boynton, a social psychologist. Despite previous disappointments with journalists, Dr. Boynton enjoyed speaking with the media and was glad for the chance to correct the problems in the NY Times article. She took great pains to lay out her concerns, and invited her colleagues to send information to the journalist in the hopes that she might gain a comprehensive perspective on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough. The Sunday Times printed a duplicate of the NY Times article, including nothing but a few sentences that completely misrepresented Dr. Boynton’s work and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Boynton was understandably upset. &lt;a href="http://www.drpetra.co.uk/blog/?p=806"&gt;On her blog&lt;/a&gt;, she posted an excellent (yet ultimately heartbreaking) essay describing the events in detail, ending with a breakdown of how this hurts everyone: misquoting her and misrepresenting her research puts her job at risk, the public is misled about sex research, and scientists everywhere take note that in the future, they cannot trust journalists to do a thorough job, so why bother dealing with them at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kills me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do? All I want is the opportunity to share good sex science with the public in ways that helps them understand their lives. I have to do this with journalists a lot of the time, but each time something like this happens I wonder if my colleagues who don’t get involved with the press have a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really feel the time has come for to stop trying to explain sex research to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Boyle was and is exactly the kind of scientist the public needs: someone who is smart, savvy, and for ten years was willing to work with the media to convey a story. It’s tragic to lose someone like that due to journalistic incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day there are more layoffs at mainstream media outlets, making matters worse as good journalists are fired in favor of cheaper, less knowledgeable staff. Hell, a few months ago &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/cnn_cuts_entire_science_tech_t.php"&gt;CNN cut their entire science and tech department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is this where the Internet saves the day, with blogs picking up the slack and somehow informing the public despite the present lack of sustainable funding? Or are we doomed?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236098134754"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4095">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb9dfcf996cbc550</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="philanthropy"/><category term="recession"/><title type="html">Is This the Secret for Fund-Raising in a Recession?</title><published>2009-03-04T10:41:43Z</published><updated>2009-03-04T10:41:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/I39C-2IdKuc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/is-this-the-secret-for-fund-raising-in-a-recession/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">There's been much talk about how philanthropies may be one of the greatest casualties of the recession.

&lt;p&gt;1). In &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/us/politics/02outreach.html?_r=1"&gt;an article in the NYT&lt;/a&gt; yesterday I came across the verb form ‘Obama-tizing’ (hyphen in the original), and realized that because his name ends with a vowel, you can’t just add -&lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt;. But why the choice of ‘t’ as epenthetic consonant? It doesn’t sound totally natural to me, but I don’t know any other consonant that would sound better. Is it just because there are various Latinate groups of words with a ‘t’ in some of their forms like ‘sane – sanity – sanitize’? I found the neologism &lt;em&gt;overcommatize&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="http://esa4.rice.edu/~ling215/browse.php?l=o"&gt;this fun page from Rice University&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe –&lt;em&gt;tize&lt;/em&gt; is the accepted allomorph of –&lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt; for vowel-final words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2).  What happens you decline the name “Barack Obama” in Russian?&lt;br&gt;
My ears perked up when they put “Barack Obama” in the instrumental case (as object of ‘with’) on the radio in Moscow yesterday: &lt;em&gt;Barakom Obamoj&lt;/em&gt; – and I realized that morphologically, &lt;em&gt;Barak&lt;/em&gt; becomes a first-declension noun – native Russian nouns that end in a hard consonant are all first-declension masculine –, while &lt;em&gt;Obama&lt;/em&gt;, ending as it does in –&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;, becomes a second-declension noun, and the great majority of those are feminine. And I wasn’t sure whether that was “peculiar” or not – I noticed it, but would a Russian? The situation with prototypical Russian names is that for men both names are first-declension consonant-final masculine (Mikhail Gorbachev), and for women both are second-declension –&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; final feminine (Raisa Gorbacheva).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In Russian, foreign proper names usually get declined with Russian morphology when they look like possible Russian words; for instance, Barbara makes a fine second-declension noun – genitive Barbary, accusative Barbaru, etc., but Partee (Парти) stays undeclined. There’s a substantial class of borrowed words established in Russian that are indeclinable, including &lt;em&gt;kino, metro, tabu, kenguru, kofe, kakao&lt;/em&gt;. There are notes about these and other indeclinables in &lt;a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/11/11-2149.html"&gt;an issue of Linguist List&lt;/a&gt;, and my husband’s late wife Lidia Knorina did a study of Russian indeclinable nouns. They are not only ones with endings that don’t look like the nominative singular of any natural declension class – witness indeclinable borrowed &lt;em&gt;kino&lt;/em&gt; and normally declined Russian &lt;em&gt;okno&lt;/em&gt; ‘window’ (-o class, first declension neuter), both with final stress, but &lt;em&gt;kino&lt;/em&gt;, though common, remains indeclinable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphological mismatch between given name and surname doesn’t create any contradictions or problems in Russian, because (a) declension-class and gender are not perfectly correlated anyway, though there are certainly some strong generalizations (first-declension nouns that end in a hard consonant are masculine, and those that end in -&lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt; are neuter; and the large majority of second-declension nouns end in -&lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;and are feminine), and (b) the whole name will always be treated as syntactically masculine if the referent is male. The opposite 'mismatch' – first name second-declension, ending in -a, surname a first-declension masculine, is very common in Russian, since most nicknames for both males and females are a-final second-declension nouns – Volodja, Sasha, Petja, Vanja – so a man’s name like Volodja Borschev is syntactically masculine and morphologically ‘split’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was going to write that the Obama case doesn’t arise in Russian, because surnames always fit the sex (if declinable at all) – Gorbachev, Gorbacheva, etc., and it’s only nicknames where morphological gender and natural sex don’t always agree. (I think that full given names, at least if they’re really Slavic, always have gender-sex match: Sasha (m. or f.) is the nickname for both Aleksandr (m.) and Aleksandra (f.).) I thought a man in Russia couldn't have a surname like 'Obama'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my husband informs me that there are Obama-like cases in Russian already, involving non-Slavic names that have been ‘naturalized’ into Russian – a common enough phenomenon involving both indigenous minority populations and ethnic immigrant populations. So there is someone in the news lately whose surname is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_V._Kara-Murza"&gt;Kara-Murza&lt;/a&gt;: he’s male, the surname (naturalized into Russian from some Turkic language, I think) has the shape of a second-declension a-final (usually female) noun, and it does get declined in the usual second-declension way, just like –a-final nicknames do. The surprise is that his wife and his daughter also have the surname Kara-Murza, but for the females in the family, it's indeclinable! Volodja also informs me (he knows a lot of this from his late wife’s research) that there is a surname Listopad – perfectly Slavic (in Czech it’s the name for November, in Russian it’s just the literal ‘falling of the leaves’) – for which the females in the family will also just be ‘Listopad’, not ‘Listopada’; for the males, it declines as expected in the first declension just as the common noun ‘listopad’ does, but for the females the name is indeclinable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I thought might “sound funny” to a Russian about Obama’s name turns out not to; Russians are already so accustomed to whatever may happen with borrowed names and foreign names and the existence of masculine nouns within the second declension that they don’t even notice. I guess it sounded funny to me because as a speaker of Russian as a second language I’ve only gotten an “ear” for the most widespread first-order generalizations, and haven’t internalized many of the more subtle second-order generalizations and minor patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barbara Partee</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236093139293"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-430415747785374454">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb528325b2790403</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #110:Winners</title><published>2009-03-03T14:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T15:06:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/mondays-molecule-110winners.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/430415747785374454/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=430415747785374454" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> UPDATE: The three molecules are preproinsulin, proinsulin, and insulin.

I and a lot of the rest of the medical blogosphere (such as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/03/harkins_war_on_science.php"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.getbetterhealth.com/why-non-scientists-should-not-direct-scientific-efforts-senator-harkins-misguided-beliefs-exposed/2009.03.02"&gt;Val Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://tuftedtitmouse.blogspot.com/2009/03/integrative-reporting-to-keep-news.html"&gt;Tufted Titmouse&lt;/a&gt;) shook our heads in disbelief and disgust at &lt;a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c"&gt;Harkin's statement&lt;/a&gt; (video &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I was actually somewhat happy that he did it for all to see, I couldn't believe that Harkin actually laid it on the line so bluntly about what the true purpose of NCCAM was from its very founding. Harkin's admission showed that, for all its promotion of pseudoscience, CAM "fellowships," and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_national_center_for_complementary_an.php"&gt;bad science&lt;/a&gt;, even that is not enough for promoters of woo like Senator Harkin. Even though NCCAM is incredibly friendly to pseudoscience, it has still failed to "validate" a single alternative medicine. The closest it's come is for various natural products, but testing plants and herbs for medicinal compounds is nothing that can't be done in all the other Institutes and Centers that make up the NIH. It does not need a special center. In any case, Harkin's admission also made clear that NCCAM, even in its current form, is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; too "science-y" for woo-philes, who have wanted it from the very beginning to give unscientific quackery a patina of scientific respectability and to "prove" that woo works. When, even under the easiest testing, reality does not conform to their preexisting beliefs, they lash out and try to pressure NCCAM to "validate" more woo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senator Harkin, as you may recall, is the legislator who, above all others, is &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;responsible for the creation&lt;/a&gt; of the pseudoscientific monstrosity that is NCCAM. He based his championing of "alternative medicine" on an anecdote about a friend of his from the House of Representatives who became ill, tried alternative medicine, and supposedly got better, combined with his own belief that bee pollen cured his allergies. But even a Senator as senior and powerful as Tom Harkin can't do it alone. Even he needs help. And, to help him, he brought in the Four Horsemen of the Woo-pocalypse into the very chambers of the Senate, as a two-fer from their concurrent engagement at the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=350"&gt;Institute of Medicine and Bravewell Collaborative woo-fest&lt;/a&gt; being held on the same days: &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Weil.pdf"&gt;Dr. Andy Weil, Director, Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Arizona, Vail, AZ&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Ornish.pdf"&gt;Dr. Dean Ornish, Founder and President, Preventive Medicine Research Institute, Sausalito, CA&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Hyman.pdf"&gt;Dr. Mark Hyman, Founder and Medical Director, The UltraWellness Center, Lenox, MA&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/Oz.pdf"&gt;Dr. Mehmet C. Oz, Director, Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine Program, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the opening shot in the war against science-based medicine, using President Obama's desire and plan to reform the health care system as the vehicle upon which to piggyback quackery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/mqOzD78kH1Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236092635135"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4125">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d85045b900f15e87</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="FREAK est links"/><title type="html">The FREAK-est Links</title><published>2009-03-03T14:38:38Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T14:38:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/lu2GZm7jFIo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/03/the-freak-est-links-185/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Ants invented farming millions of years before we did.

He looks at our faltering economy like we all do, with great concern, and then, unlike the kinds of rational people we need making decisions, claims that the answer lies in the Christian Bible. Seriously, read that article and you'll see nothing that wouldn't have come out of a cheap Bible college stocked with pseudo-scholarly theologians. It's so stupid it hurt to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible, they tell us, contains 2,350 verses "that have to do with money and possessions." If we attend to the lessons of these verses and learn how properly to husband the resources God has given us, we will be doing his work, for "God desires a life for us that is free of debt , and the entrapments and common pitfalls related to financial difficulties" (Cross). "The way out of debt," Dayton teaches, "is not a declaration of bankruptcy, but surrender to the word of God."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, people are concerned with money and possessions; it's a very human state of mind. What this means is that lots of books will reference those subjects: you could count the sentences that deal with money and possessions in &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Das Kapital&lt;/i&gt; and find thousands. The number of mentions of money and houses and carriages and ships and businesses does not make them legitimate authorities on economics, and doesn't mean they can't be utterly wrong (and of the last two, at least one must be wrong as a simple logical necessity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve read the Bible myself, and it really doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be big on economics. Most of its proscriptions are rather anti-wealth, for one thing, and there&amp;#39;s a fairly broad emphasis on the moral compromises of crass materialism — poverty, or rather, distancing yourself from greed and the accumulation of earthly wealth, are regarded as virtues. There really isn&amp;#39;t that much about bankruptcy anywhere in it, and this author, Kevin Cross, who pretends to be speaking for a god, seems to be making stuff up. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but God is not going to descend with a collection of legal writs to protect you from creditors, nor is he going to give you a low-interest loan to help you get over short-term cash flow problems. Surrendering to a god is a way of running away from real-world problems &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; fixing them. It is definitely not a solution for a nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanley Fish, of course, gobbles this nonsense right up and suggests that this is how we can fix our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This economy, in which funds depleted are endlessly replenished, is underwritten by a power so great and beneficent that it turns failures into treasures. Some economists identify that power as the market and ask us to have faith in it. God might be a better candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; a god is going to help the economy is something bleating theologians always fail to tell us. Similarly, there's no explanation for how this imaginary supreme being is propping up our economy. Magic? Conjuring gold? Selling timeshares and commemorative coins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this god's assistance can be encapsulated in a sentence: God help us if morons like Stanley Fish were to have a say in maintaining the American economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_bible_is_not_an_economics.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YPxLppcA_DA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236089925405"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5176877420013669818">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e993ebd2bdde99be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Octo-mom: could it happen in Canada?</title><published>2009-03-03T14:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T14:16:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/octo-mom-could-it-happen-in-canada.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5176877420013669818/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5176877420013669818" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The short answer is .... no.The University of Toronto Bulletin publishes an interview with fertility expert Robert Casper [Octo-mom: could it happen here?&amp;quot;Q.

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Quick! What&amp;#39;s the brightest star in the sky?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you said Sirius, then give yourself a &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;blue&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; gold star. But I&amp;#39;m sorry to say: Bzzzzt. You&amp;#39;re wrong. Your problem is you know too much astronomy; Sirius is the brightest star &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;in the night sky&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;. The correct answer is, duh, the Sun.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Sun is a star just like all the others in the sky, more or less, but it just so happens to be substantially closer. The funny thing is, it&amp;#39;s so close that it&amp;#39;s incredibly bright and we can&amp;#39;t even look at it. Well, we &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;can&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;, but it hurts. And the fact that it&amp;#39;s there every day (Seattlites: ignore that part) and we can&amp;#39;t even glance at it means we take it for granted. It&amp;#39;s a vast, mighty, seething cauldron of energy, and even though solar astronomers have studied it for centuries, there&amp;#39;s a lot about the Sun that&amp;#39;s still not understand. And if &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;they&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; don&amp;#39;t get it, then I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that you&amp;#39;re unaware of one or two things about it too. I&amp;#39;m fuzzy on one or two (or a thousand) things about it myself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

The omnipotent, omniscient lord of the cosmos couldn&amp;#39;t do a thing because those liberals put a restraining order on him. Right.

I'm going to be doing a new monthly science column for the Guardian, so once again, I have blithely stacked another deadline on top of the groaning pile already on my desk. This should be fun, though, and one must constantly be building beachheads on other continents if one hopes to take over the world. Besides, I've also been promoted to "leading American evolutionary biologist", which will surprise leading American evolutionary biologist everywhere, but which will look wonderfully pretentious on my CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also going to be a weekly column — we&amp;#39;ll be cycling a stable of science writers, including Simon Singh, Chris French, and Andy Miah, to keep up some regular science content on the Guardian, and you have to applaud the effort of the paper to do that, especially when science coverage seems to be weakening everywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

The gist is this - it is possible to select with almost 100% accuracy the sex of your child if you are conceiving through IVF (in-vitro fertilization). However, there are no home-kits or other techniques on the market that work. There are sperm-sorting technologies (the sex of a child is determined by the sperm from the dad, not the egg from the mom) being developed and in clinical trials, but nothing yet on the market that I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I speculated that such technology is likely to progress to disease prevention and then to selecting desirable traits not directly related to health. And then further to genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, an IVF clinic in the US has made a significant step in that direction, and the predictable controversy has ensued. The Fertility Institutes are now offering their clients the ability to select certain traits, like hair and eye color, of the eggs they implant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IVF and PGD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-vitro fertilization is the technique of extracting eggs from a female donor (either the proseptive mother or a separate donor), fertilizing the egg with sperm from the dad (or again from a donor) and then implanting several fertilized eggs into the mother or a surrogate. &lt;a href="http://www.jonesinstitute.org/ivf-success-rates.html"&gt;The success rate&lt;/a&gt; varies based upon many variables - age of the mother, whether or not the embryos were cryopreserved or used fresh, and the experience of the clinic. But generally rates of live births from IVF are around 30-40%. Per embryo the number is lower, which is why several embryos are transplanted at once, creating the possibility of multiple births.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGD stands for preimplantion genetic diagnosis - genetically analysing embros prior to implantation. The primary purpose of this is to increase the success rate of IVF. Originally embryos were visually inspected under the microscope and the healthiest looking embryos are implanted. This is still the standard in many clinics. However, some clinics offer PGD, which takes a look at the chromosomes in each embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cells, including the cells in embryos, have 23 pairs of chromosomes, including the XY sex chromosome. Chromosomal analysis is able to detect aneuploidy, which is an abnormality in the number of chromosome pairs. For example, there may be one or three of one type of chromosome. Chromosomal analysis is also able to detect with near 100% accuracy the sex of the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selecting out embryos with normal chromosomes the success rate of IVF is increased significantly, even allowing for the implantation of fewer embryos. This much is not controversial and represents a technological advance for IVF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IVF clinics have also been offering more sophisticated genetic analysis. What they do is take a very precise biopsy of each embryo. They wait 2-3 days post fertilization when the embryo still have only a few cells and the cells are still distinct enough that one can be removed without disturbing the others. Also, at this stage each cell in the embryo is still undifferentiated, so removal one cell has no effect, the others can still go on to produce a normal child. In fact, this is the stage at which identical twins are formed - the embryo splits in two and each half is capable of developing into a normal child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single cell removed from the embryo can now be analyzed not only with chromosomal analysis but genetic analysis for single gene mutations. They currently screen for over 90 specific mutations, from muscular dystrophy to sickle-cell anemia. Again - this is not controversial. If someone is going to go through the painstaking process of IVF, they might as well choose embryos that do not have the genes for a horrible disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designer Babies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now is where the controversy comes in. This same company is offering as part of their genetic analysis the option of choosing cosmetic details, like eye and hair color.  Because these traits can be genetically complex, they do not make 100% guarantees for these traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy seems to be based entirely on subjective moral sense. At least I have not heard any cogent arguments as to why parents should not be free to make such choices with their own sperm and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7918296.stm"&gt;BBC article &lt;/a&gt;on the topic Dr. Gillian Lockwood, a UK fertility expert and member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ ethics committee, is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it gets to the point where we can decide which gene or combination of genes are responsible for blue eyes or blonde hair, what are you going to do with all those other embryos that turn out like me to be ginger with green eyes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She warned against “turning babies into commodities that you buy off the shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds like an emotional appeal. I’m not sure what the moral principle she thinks is at work here.  Is it just fooling with nature, or that genetics should be random? This sounds like the same kind of arguments that cropped up when the girl had the baboon heart transplant. People protested that animal proteins should not be mixed with human proteins. Why? I guess all those people with pig or cow heart valves should not have had their life-saving surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that part of the moral squeamishness comes from the tendency for people to self-identify with their physical characteristics. Dr. Lockwood seems to identify with being a ginger, for example. But as cosmetic technology advances the ability to change our physical look is progressing rapidly. It is likely that future generations will change their physical characteristics as casually as we change out clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One potentially legitimate argument is more of a practical than moral one. If too many couples select the sex of their child we may end up with a surplus of one gender over the other.  However, at the moment IVF is such a small fraction of births that this is not a concern. If gender selection becomes more prominent in the future then it would be reasonable to monitor the effect of choice on male/female ratios, but until then the argument is premature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the UK currently bans gender selection with IVF. Only medical screening is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another controversial point comes from the right-to-life camp who feel that it is immoral to create extra embryos. In Italy, for example, the production of extra embryos itself is illegal, and this, of course, eliminates all gender, medical, and cosmetic selection. I understand that this is a personal moral choice and not one that can be objectively resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I have no problem with parents using technology to choose which of their genes they pass onto their children, rather than being forced to accept what chance provides. I file this under personal choice. I do not see a compelling interest by the state to illegalize this choice. At least the burden should be on them to prove a potential risk to public or individual health or some compelling state interest before infringing upon individual rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I see this technology as inevitable. Moral arguments based largely on being uncomfortable with new technology tend to fade over time.  Genetic selection to avoid disease is already here and there is no serious opposition to it. Next is line is health promotion (better genes for heart health, or reduce the risk of diabetes). The financial benefits of reducing chronic illness alone are likely to overwhelm any moral compunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future generations who take genetic selection for health for granted will not likely have much of a problem with selecting other progressively superficial traits. There are plenty of people today who are comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;My favorite plot twist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;Ducking around a corner, I stood behind a tree and waited. A figure in a dark raincoat came around, and I grabbed an arm and twisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;“Hey! Take it easy, buster. Do you know who I am?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;A woman’s voice. I pulled her over to a streetlight for a look. “Well, well, a little far from home, Ms. Freeman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;Jan Freeman, copy-editor-turned-moll for Language Log’s Boston family. First non-linguist to be named a consigliere. I let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;Rubbing her arm, she said, “You’re out of your depth here, McIntyre. Go home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;“No chance, sister. I’m not going to walk away and let you do Steven Pinker’s dirty work. I know about the putsch, and what’s more, I figured out who killed the Mister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:#990000"&gt;Her shoulders slumped. She shook her head and turned. She stopped and hissed at me: “You're just a two-bit grifter, and that's all you'll ever be.” Then she was gone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236080000015"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_221.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3268dd7aabc1a84f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-03T09:05:57Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T09:05:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/rJArunkf1fM/clock_quotes_221.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_221.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce, subsidized those who refuse to produce, and canonized those who complain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left:40px;color:red"&gt;I seem to remember a Language Log post about the construction "I appreciate you coming over to help me" as opposed to the prescriptively approved "I appreciate your coming over to help me." I am in a discussion with a prescriptivist about the validity of the former but I can't find the relevant post on LL. Can you help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a couple of relevant posts over the years, but what this reader really needed was a reminder to check his copy of the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Dictionary-English-Usage-Merriam-Webster/dp/0877791325/"&gt;Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage&lt;/a&gt; (or the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Concise-Dictionary-English-Usage/dp/0877796335/"&gt;concise edition&lt;/a&gt; of the same work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the MWDEU entry on &lt;span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"&gt;possessive with gerund&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

And just as important, when a question of English usage comes up, it's one of the first places that  you should look for an evidence-based opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a deeper discussion of the grammar of these contructions, see &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel/"&gt;CGEL&lt;/a&gt; 14 § 1.5 (pp. 1187-1193), &amp;quot;The structure of gerund-participials&amp;quot;, which implicitly amends MWDEU&amp;#39;s generalization that &amp;quot;From the middle of the 18th century to the present time, grammarians […] cannot parse it, they cannot explain it, they cannot decide whether the possessive is correct or not&amp;quot;. CGEL will also give you another argument against the quaint view that the possessive should always be obligatory, namely the treatment of fused-head demonstratives like &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;I object to this being called a loophole.&lt;br&gt;

On Saturday there's a program at our YMCA for kids on the spectrum, created by a parent. It's two hours of swimming and gymnastics, with high school volunteers paired with each child. The program's gotten quite popular and---we're usually late, ahem---it's rare that Charlie gets to swim with anyone. This Saturday, there were too many volunteers when we got to the pool and Charlie was paired with a teenage guy---Jim and I thought, great!. There's been times when he's paired with students who he's the same height or taller than; usually it's the preschoolers and younger kids who are first paired with volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie sped across the pool, the volunteer beside him, kicking and face in and on his back. While a strong swimmer, a little encouragement and companionship go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I didn't know what to say when, after a girl a few years younger than Charlie entered, arms moving in the air a bit, we were asked: "Does Charlie really need a volunteer?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the other girl did. Clearly Charlie was dropping down to the bottom of the pool and (with a little coaxing from me) attending to the volunteer and swimming to the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted how rarely Charlie gets to swim with someone---a guy, especially---how, yes, he still needed a volunteer. The woman who asked me nodded but looked perplexed as she walked over to speak to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I have said, no, Charlie didn't need the volunteer? (Truly, he did.) How would I have felt if I had been the girl's mother, seeing a muscular, tall boy back-floating in the deep end and "hogging" a volunteer that her daughter (who didn't seem to know how to swim) stood on the sidelines? How to explain how Charlie was benefiting in so many unobvious ways, from the chance to interact and listen to someone he'd just met? Things change when (sigh) you're not a cute little kid who can be carried. Needs change and a helping hand is still needed----just in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And anyways, it's well that Charlie learns to swim with a friend----someday he might like to try &lt;a href="http://www.newschief.com/article/20090301/NEWS/903010319/0/APA?Title=Scuba-diving-classes-immerse-disabled-in-new-experiences"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236069525588"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba8cff1411198926</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Coconut Crab</title><published>2009-03-03T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/coconutcrab.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">E-mail forwards describe and show pictures of coconut crabs.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236069305169"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=3711">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f421d5e0305f541</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Science Communication: So What?</title><published>2009-03-03T08:03:10Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T08:03:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/03/03/science-communication-so-what/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">A guest writer provides an overview of the field of the public understanding of science.

The &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010.html"&gt;decadal review process&lt;/a&gt; assesses the state of the field, figures out where best to invest limited resources to maximize the scientific return, and creates a report that lays out the scientific and technical priorities for the coming decade.  This document becomes close to holy writ for funding agencies, who use it as a roadmap for deciding which facilities deserve funding.  The decadal reports for astronomy have served us well in political circles, since they offer clear prioritization based on community-wide input, rather that a long list of projects clamoring for support.  (The rumor is that other scientific fields don’t do quite so well at prioritization during similar exercises, perhaps because they lack astronomers’ long reliance on shared facilities, which forces us to practice playing well with others on a regular basis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the review process is evaluating key areas where we think substantial scientific progress can be made in the next 10 years, either with existing facilities, or with new ones.  We’ve also been tasked with identifying areas with unusual “discovery potential”.  This work is being done by various “&lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_Science_Frontier_Panels.html"&gt;Science Frontiers Panels&lt;/a&gt;“, after community input in the form of white papers (see the list &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_SWP_Titles.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and town hall meetings.   Our reports then go to the “&lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_Program_Prioritization_Panels.html"&gt;Program Prioritization Panels&lt;/a&gt;“, who then start the hard work of ranking the various missions, facilities, and projects, in light of the priorities identified by the SFP and the “&lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_ISGs.html"&gt;Infrastructure and State of the Profession Study Groups&lt;/a&gt;“.  (Horrific org chart can be found &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_Structure.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given that the SFP’s are encouraged to gather input from the community, I am throwing open to the floor to your thoughts on the important scientific opportunities in astronomy and astrophysics during the next 10 years.  I’ll do my best to get the info to the relevant committees, particularly if you tag your suggestions with your preferred subcommittee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planetary Systems and Star Formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stars and Stellar Evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Galactic Neighborhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galaxies Through Cosmic Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cosmology and Fundamental Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be helpful to let us know whether you’re a professional astronomer, physicist, or interested bystander.  Please use pseudonyms if you’d like to be anonymous, so that we can follow the thread of discussion more easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a nice Facebook discussion group hashing things out &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=53303333142&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Feel free to join in either venue.&lt;/p&gt;

The True Believer tells me his guru’s book is the Real Stuff. He tells me I have a closed mind and won’t look at anything outside establishment dogma, and if I only read the book and understood Dr. Quack’s evidence and arguments, I would be a True Believer too. I have tried, really I have. I’ve given the Dr. Quacks every chance to convert me, and I’ve hoped to learn something new, but I’m always disappointed. I’ve come to the point that I feel like I’m reading the same book over and over: it is always a mixture of real science, pseudoscience, and speculation, based on cherry-picked evidence and argued with the same logical fallacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently got hooked into reading another one by a correspondent who had called me an “ignorant relic” for writing a “grossly ignorant article” about alternative medicine. I suggested he read R. Barker Bausell’s book &lt;em&gt;Snake Oil Science &lt;/em&gt;and a couple of others, which he promised to do. Then he said, “If I am willing to buy three books that you have suggested and read them and you are not willing to read what I have suggested, then that pretty much says all that needs to be said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was willing, even though the very title of the book suggested that its message was incompatible with the scientific evidence as I know it: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prevent-Treat-Cancer-Natural-Medicine/dp/1573223433"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Prevent and Treat Cancer with Natural Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The authors are big names in naturopathic and herbal medicine: Michael Murray, Tim Birdsall, Joseph Pizzorno, and Paul Riley. It’s nowhere near as bad as some of the bad books I’ve read, but it is a good example of the genre and I’ll use it to illustrate why I call them bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offers “an arsenal of disease-fighting tools for prevention, treatment, and coping with side effects” (Yes, it offers tools; but do those tools work?) And it promises to “change your internal environment so cancer can’t survive.” (Wow! If it could really do that, every oncologist in the world would enthusiastically adopt these methods and the authors would be eligible for a Nobel prize.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its coverage of cancer risk factors and screening tests is reasonable, and it doesn’t discourage conventional cancer treatment. It recommends conventional preventive measures like exercise, weight control, and healthy diet, and points out the need for extra attention to good nutrition during cancer treatment. It doesn’t descend to the level of Andrew Weil’s promotion of “stoned thinking” and intuition as a source of knowledge. It appears to be grounded in science and its recommendations are evidence-based. The problem is that it accepts evidence of exceedingly poor quality, and it accepts evidence that has been superseded by other contradictory evidence (which it conveniently fails to acknowledge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trivial example, but one that illustrates their loose approach: they tell us acupuncture dates back 5000 years to &lt;em&gt;The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, attributed to the emperor Huang Ti in 2697 BC. They don’t mention that modern scholars have determined that the book was written much later, probably in the second century BC. The older date enhances their claim that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCM [Traditional Chinese Medicine] has been practiced for millennia, longer than any other medical system. There must be something valuable in it! [Logical fallacy]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They fully accept the claims of TCM. They fail to mention that the so-called acupuncture meridians have never been detected, and they speak of the mythical qi as if it were as real as blood pressure. They accept the totally unsubstantiated concept of “energy medicine.” They think there is no fundamental clash between Western medicine and TCM, that just as light can exist as particles or waves, health problems can affect both chemical balance and energy balance. [false analogy]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;External hydrotherapy treatments have been shown to produce profound effects on immune function. In particular, applications of hot water have been shown to boost the number and activity of natural killer cells – key white blood cells in the fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reference, they cite &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11146901?ordinalpos=4&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;. This was a preliminary study with only 10 subjects and no controls, and the number of NK cells only increased in 5 patients. A search of PubMed yielded only one other study of hydrotherapy and immune function, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17631258?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;this one &lt;/a&gt;also uncontrolled and involving only 11 subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would have to put on the strongest rose-colored glasses to interpret these two questionable studies as evidence of “profound effects.” And that is exactly what these authors do throughout the book. Their rose-colored glasses over-interpret the significance of every study that supports their bias while they filter out any contradictory information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They state that faith and the power of prayer have been “validated by several rigorous scientific studies” showing that prayer affects everything from the mutation rate of bacteria to the size of tumors. This is simply not true. Claims for the medical efficacy of prayer have been repeatedly and thoroughly &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/prayer.html"&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt;. Yet these authors say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our opinion, given the scientific support of prayer’s beneficial effects, not praying for the best possible outcome may be the equivalent of deliberately withholding an effective drug or a surgical procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stop short of advising us which God to pray to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For patients undergoing surgery, they say “It is very important to use gotu kola to prevent the formation of adhesions.” They say it has “demonstrated impressive clinical results in promoting wound repair.” The &lt;em&gt;Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database&lt;/em&gt;, after reviewing all the published studies on gotu kola, concluded that it is “possibly effective” when used topically for wound healing and prevention of keloids, and “possibly safe.” I couldn’t find a shred of evidence anywhere that it can prevent the formation of adhesions internally. As far as I can tell, the authors just made that up, extrapolating from the idea of wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cancer prevention, they recommend everyone take 17 supplemental vitamins, 14 supplemental minerals, flavonoids, daily green drinks (green tea, dehydrated barley grass, wheat grass, chlorella, spirulina), probiotics, fish oil supplements, and for extra protection against specific cancers, curcumin, quercetin, ground flaxseed oil, lycopene, etc. The evidence to support these recommendations is sketchy at best (I’m trying really hard to say this politely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll stop with these few examples. It would take a book twice as long as theirs to properly critique all their questionable statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a strange mixture. It contains a lot of good science and good advice, but it also contains statements that are clearly false, and much of it consists of unjustified extrapolations from preclinical or preliminary studies. It unwisely makes clinical recommendations for the entire human population on the basis of a few animal or in vitro studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It epitomizes the difference between “evidence-based” and true science-based medicine. It is easy to find studies that serve as “evidence” for any viewpoint, but the true scientist weighs those against other contradictory studies, assesses the study design and the quality of evidence, asks if the data have been replicated elsewhere, looks at prior plausibility and compatibility with other scientific knowledge, and tries to judge what the entire body of scientific evidence means. As Ioannidis showed in his &lt;a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124"&gt;landmark article&lt;/a&gt;, most published studies are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has the appearance of science and authority and it cites lots of references. It is written to impress the general public, and I’m sure it sounds very convincing to someone who is not well versed in the subjects covered. But its defects are obvious to anyone who truly understands the scientific method. The authors have an obvious bias; they are not objective, some of the things they say are demonstrably false, and the book is not a reliable source of information or advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of science book: one aims to educate the public by explaining the current state of evidence and the consensus of the scientific community. The other has an agenda: it uses (and mis-uses) science to persuade readers to believe something that the authors believe but that the scientific community as a whole has rejected. I have learned to tell them apart at a glance. Unfortunately, the general reader hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;caveat lector&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Matthew effect applies to journals and papers too - a highly cited journal or paper is likely to attract more citations (and mis-citations), probably for the simple psychological reasoning that 'if so many people cite it, it must be a reasonable paper to cite' (and such a paper is, by definition, more likely to appear in the reference list of another paper). Clearly that reasoning can be applied whether the paper has been read or otherwise. Simkin and Roychowdhury (2005 and 2007) note that a clear pointer to the citation of a paper one has not read is if it copies a mis-citation, and  an analysis of the frequency of such serial mis-citations allows one to estimate, statistically, what fraction of cited articles have actually been read - at least at or near the time of writing a paper - by the citing author. Their analyses show (at least for certain physics papers) that "about 70-90% of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used in other papers", and that a typical device is to start with a few recent ones plus their citations. Some aspects of this tendency in bibliometrics, especially with highly cited papers, can be detected from the power law form of the distribution of citation numbers, as in the Laws of Bradford and Lotka that I discussed before. Of course the mindless propagation of errors without checking sources properly is hardly confined to Science - a famous recent example with spoof data showed how some journalists simply copied Obituary material from Wikipedia!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know people do this. Drives me crazy! Every paper I ever cited I read and re-read and re-read. Heck, I even tried to slog through papers in German (which I don't speak) if I thought they were relevant. But copy+paste just because others did? Nope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_matthew_effect_in_science.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/0BXDShhjfgc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236064759443"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/did_i_see_that.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2b04cb1199b8332</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Did I see that?</title><published>2009-03-03T04:48:38Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T04:48:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/2tC7UWlusAY/did_i_see_that.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/did_i_see_that.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Twitter doesn't need an introduction. The microblogging service is widely popular, and most Twitter users swear by its wonderful utility. It is a "Social Commons", as one enthusiastic web junkie put it. But a few months into using Twitter, I realised that there are very few scientists - and I mean natural scientists, on Twitter. For instance, at the time of writing this post, the Twitter account science had 2,247 followers , while some popular individuals have followers 10-fold that number.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hey @Boraz: Scientists (mainly, me) are close to announcing a branching off from the curmudgeons, a new species, almost. The Replacements."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Boraz" title=""&gt;response on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;@jayrosen_nyu I am all ears! The Replacements! Sounds like a superhero comic strip, a movie one day!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay, on FriendFeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Replacements are those who mistakenly believe that crowing for the 1,000 time that bloggers cannot replace journalists is an important and insightful act. Identifying feature: they make a show of disagreeing with the hordes of writers who think bloggers CAN replace (newspaper) journalists but fail to quote or link to any. Recent case: &lt;a href="http://is.gd/llQa" title=""&gt;http://is.gd/llQa&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: &lt;a href="http://is.gd/ls5v" title=""&gt;http://is.gd/ls5v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/8f647489-abcc-205f-9957-564182821efc/Hey-Boraz-Scientists-mainly-me-are-close-to/" title=""&gt;response on FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An important part of their argument, which usually comes out clearly if they engage in the discussion with the commenters, is the sudden switch in the meaning of the word "blog". As we know, blog is software. What one uses it for is a different story. But....

&lt;p&gt;...invariably some commenter mentions HuffPo, TPM, Firedoglake or a good local blog that does investigative reporting. Those sites originated as blogs, and have a bloggy look and feel (and use blogging software), but they have grown into New Media organizations, with paid reporters and interns and editors, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as that happens, they jump on it and switch to their preferred meaning of 'blog' - the small individual site full of LOLCats and adolescent angst. No, nobody suggested those kids will do investigative journalism, so this is a hijack of the meaning. Josh Marshal does not have adolescent angst, as far as I can tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most bloggers say in these discussions is that they don't want to become journalists, that a small number of really good bloggers may want to become professional journalists, and that many laid-off journalists will become bloggers but only in the sense of "doing their stuff online instead of in print". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the sense that a lot of journalism is (usually botched) transcription of what the sources or experts say, while today sources and experts can talk directly to the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are accidental journalists - people who happen to be at the right place at the right time and report the news (e.g., the guy who lives next to the Minnesota bridge that fell) for a few days, then go back to their normal lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever said that little bloggers with LOLcats and adolescent angst are going to replace journalists. But the method and style of journalism, as it abandons the expensive paper and moves to the Web, will have to change. Also, both the hyperlocal and the huge global papers will survive with some good paper/Web combo. The medium-sized city/state papers owned by chains are those that will die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many bloggers are worried that there will be a period of vacuum after the papers die and before New Media manages to take over with a new model and be able to cover everything the papers covered till now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/introducing_the_replacements.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/I32z5xylqcU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236064759441"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/open_access_in_the_developing.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e077cd6d4ce26af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Science"/><title type="html">Open Access in the developing world - yes, it is a Good.Thing.</title><published>2009-03-03T04:18:11Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T04:18:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/SDXuMeoPXnM/open_access_in_the_developing.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/open_access_in_the_developing.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days back a &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-02/nsf-oat022009.php" title=""&gt;paper came out&lt;/a&gt; (not OA, sorry), with a keen grasp of the obvious: Open Access is useful for those living in countries where they do not have much access.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Harold Varmus, the president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and a former director of the National Institutes of Health, said increasing public access to the findings of medical research would be important for health care reform to succeed.

&lt;p&gt;"One obvious goal is getting information out to health care practitioners about effectiveness experiments," said Dr. Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning cancer biologist and the author of the new book "The Art and Politics of Science" (Norton). "This is going to be crucial, because if the government's going to spend $1.1. billion from the stimulus bill on comparative effectiveness research, you want that stuff to be in the public domain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2009/02/25/experts-seek-intellectual-property-reform" title=""&gt;Experts Seek Intellectual Property Reform&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nobel laureates Sir John Sulston and Harry Varmus, College of Physicians and Surgeons '66, provided a scientific perspective, suggesting that life sciences research has been hampered by commercial concerns.

&lt;p&gt;"It's not just about IP [intellectual property], it's about rebalancing the way we fund things," said Sulston, a pioneering geneticist, complaining that too much private funding tends to "short circuit" research by subjugating scientific discovery to the short-term profit motive. He criticized privately-funded research for hindering the free dissemination of results, adding that for effective progress to occur, "everybody needs to see all of the data at once, not just some of it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varmus picked up on this point, explaining that scientists' collective obsession with publishing their work in prestigious journals has led to a biased system that only publicizes a small subset of useful scientific results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/harold_varmus_is_everywhere.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/DxrQP8FWb-E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236059124808"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3bd8870eb496974</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">A Message From the Spirit World</title><published>2009-03-03T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/461-a-message-from-the-spirit-world.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have received a personal message from beyond the grave, in the form of an audio file.

While education is the topic I write most about here, with my son getting older, two other issues that have become of growing concern are work---what job will Charlie have one day?---and safety---and not only about him running away or getting lost, but about the potential for abuse and, just to get every worry out, sexual abuse.  Two recent news artlcle highlight these topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Appleton, Wisconsin, the March 2nd &lt;a href="http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20090302/APC0101/903020434/1979"&gt;Post-Crescent&lt;/a&gt; reports about Jimmy Brodhagen. Still a student at Menasha High School, Brodhagen works three days a week in five-hour shifts doing data entry for Ferguson, a local wholesale plumbing and piping business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brodhagen's story is hopeful and full of possibility and let's hope for more such accounts, and fewer like this: In Saginaw, Michigan, yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/saginawnews/index.ssf?/base/news-7/1236007236304350.xml&amp;amp;coll=9"&gt;Saginaw News&lt;/a&gt; reports that a 42-year-old teaching assistant at the Millet Learning Center, Todd L. Pesta, allegedly sexually assaulted a young woman in her 20s who's on the autism spectrum. The abuse was seen by another teaching assistant, who said she saw the assault while taking her own students to the cafeteria. Pesta, who has been terminated and faces up to 15 years in prison, says that he "accidentally touched the woman's breast."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern, indeed, is---provided that Charlie does get a job, perhaps in the private sector---how to make sure that he is not being taken advantage of or otherwise ill-treated? I know he'll need to have a job coach, whose job will have come with some very serious responsibilities----the need for trained staff, teachers, therapists, aides, and really any professionals who interact with individuals on the spectrum is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cape Coral, Florida, Kellie Elders is asking the Local Advocacy Council for Mental Health to start a task force to "oversee the treatment of special-needs children, specifically in local schools," today's &lt;a href="http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009903030333"&gt;News-Press&lt;/a&gt; reports. Elders's 9-year-old daughter, Caitlin, has schizoaffective disorder with bipolar type and autism; the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10-year-old_arrested"&gt;10-year-old boy on the spectrum&lt;/a&gt; in Cape Coral  was arrested at school. A 9-year-old with schizophrenia in Fort Myers was arrested back in October. Caitlin is now in a residential treatment center as "after she was injured when restrained at Lee schools, where officials struggled to handle her." Says Elders:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why are mentally ill children ... getting arrested when they are probably having a psychotic episode?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for highly trained, carefully supervised and supported, and fairly compensated staff was a topic that came up several times when I was at Sunday's session to prepare for the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_nj_listening_tour"&gt;Autism NJ Listening Tour&lt;/a&gt;. And when I think about work and safety for my son's future, it's all too clear why.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236048728751"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/now_its_our_job_to_keep_the_de.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b98a65c46e5fca2f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Now it's our job to keep the Democrats' toes to the fire</title><published>2009-03-03T00:41:08Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T00:41:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/pFQheIgc7FM/now_its_our_job_to_keep_the_de.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/now_its_our_job_to_keep_the_de.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Senator Tom Harkin luvz him some alternative medicine.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many scientists use science blogs to post information on their work and receive comments from other scientists and from people outside the usual circle of readers. Some authors even suggest posting in blogs part of their works before publishing them, in order to exchange ideas and bring new perspectives. Scientists who use blogs consider them a complement to - not a replacement of - scientific journals, since they represent documents that do not substitute articles, but that establish a maturing stage of scientific work preparation, which is static and limited in terms of scope. However, many scientists still see blogs as a distraction from the real world and believe they do not gain much by commenting their work with lay people or specialists from other fields. Some consider attractive the possibility of communication through blogs, but do it anonymously, afraid of being deemed as not serious, or criticized for dedicating time to tasks that are not acknowledged as academic activities.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/blogs_firmly_established_as_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/IlIuLqKu_bc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236048728749"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/harold_varmus_on_daily_show_to.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6426c24f6bfd3ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="PLoS"/><title type="html">Harold Varmus on Daily Show tonight</title><published>2009-03-02T22:53:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:53:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/5oL4q743FGw/harold_varmus_on_daily_show_to.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/harold_varmus_on_daily_show_to.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So says &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-access-notes-harold-varmus-on.html" title=""&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt;.

We’ll be talking about various current events, probably &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/01/100-meter-asteroid-will-pass-earth-monday/"&gt;the asteroid that just skimmed past us&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/23/naked-eye-comet-graces-the-skies/"&gt;Comet Lulin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/02/plutos-atmosphere-is-upside-down/"&gt;Pluto’s atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/01/change-1-impacts-the-moon/"&gt; the Chinese Moon probe&lt;/a&gt;, and anything else we have time for. The whole thing will be under an hour, and I get excited and talk a lot, so we probably won’t cover all of these. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, check out &lt;a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/gen/page2970.html?theme=light"&gt;this awesome image of tree pareidolia&lt;/a&gt; on the C2C site. Hypnotree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I found &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RKKgMDK7A4&amp;amp;fmt=18"&gt;this way cool video&lt;/a&gt; of the asteroid that zoomed by this morning. It’s not much to look at, but note the time display, and remember this thing isn’t all that much bigger than a house.&lt;/p&gt;

He had a very distinctive speaking style and a fantastic understanding of how to use inflection, dramatic pauses, and other verbal cues to give his stories and statements the greatest possible impact. Whether he was holding back the punchline to a humorous piece or the touching twist ending to an inspirational essay, he could pack more emotional gravitas into a closing line than most hosts could achieve over an hour-long broadcast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I won't dispute any of that. The man was easily one of the most recognizable figures on the radio, and perhaps in all of media. When I was younger, I was exposed (against my will) to all manner of bad talk radio, from Dr. Laura to Rush Limbaugh to the local blowhards, and Paul Harvey was the welcome interruption I ended up always looking forward to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the wake of his passing, I hear all manner of glorifying hyperbole, talking about what a great broadcaster and stand-up guy and exemplary journalist the man was, and at that I have to stand up and object. No, Harvey was a distinctive voice and a fine oral storyteller, but he was no exemplar of anything journalism- or news-related. For that, one must possess &lt;i&gt;ethics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Harvey never met a touching story that he didn't like and repeat. He also apparently never met a touching story that he &lt;i&gt;researched&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://snopes.com/glurge/glurge.asp"&gt;Glurge&lt;/a&gt; section at &lt;a href="http://snopes.com/"&gt;Snopes&lt;/a&gt; is filled to brimming with false stories of courage and perseverance that Harvey decided to report as true. From &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/history/american/pricepaid.asp"&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt; about the signers of the Declaration of Independence to the &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/hero.asp"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; lovemaking mishap, if there was an urban legend with a nice socially conservative moral message making the rounds in chain letters and spam e-mail, then chances are it passed through Harvey's lips at some point in its lifetime. A broadcaster deserving of the superlatives heaped upon Paul Harvey in the last couple of days could have checked the facts of these stories and exercised proper journalistic discretion in propagating them thereafter; Harvey apparently lacked such discretion. For Harvey, the truth was apparently not as important as a good (rest of the) story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd say something about Harvey's seamless transitions from "news" into advertisements, and the way he would apparently lend his air of respectability for any product willing to cut a check for the right amount, but I've noticed more recently--with some twinge of sadness--that this is simply the norm for radio hosts. Perhaps I'm wrong to see this as a mark against objectivity--especially since few talk radio hosts give any pretense to objectivity. And if Paul Harvey presented his show the way that Rush Limbaugh or Al Franken would--as a politically-slanted show promoting the host's particular opinions--perhaps I'd be less bothered by it. But Harvey's show is presented as news--folksy, slice-of-life news, but news nonetheless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which brings us to the other key problem with Harvey's reporting--on those occasions when his stories were actually about true events, they were often spun to the point of near-fictionality to promote a conservative social and political agenda. &lt;a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1394"&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; lists some such transgressions. I'd not bat an eye at this claim if levied against Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity or the host of any other opinion show, but Harvey's program is promoted as "news," breaks into the normal flow of programming like a news report, is structured like a news report, and lasts about as long as the news reporting. If Harvey were going to put so much spin into his home-spun "news," then he needed to drop the term "news" from the "News and Comment" title of the show, and his eulogizers today need to stop going along with it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To respond to one claim in particular, I heard Ed Schultz today claiming that Harvey's human interest stories are something that we don't have enough of in today's media. I'd ask Ed what media he's part of, because it must not be anything like the media I'm familiar with. Human interest stories &lt;i&gt;rule&lt;/i&gt; the media's presentation of news, to the degree that nearly every story reported must have some conventional human angle attached. We begin every story on the economy with some person to act as the face of the problem; uninformed people on the street are consulted for their opinions, pitting them against experts and analysts, as though each point is equally worthwhile; and nearly every newscast concludes with some quirky story about a man who survived being struck by lightning or the area's largest baked good or some other human interest fluff piece. The "human interest" angle is why Jenny McCarthy's views on autism have more traction in the public arena than the views of the majority of doctors and scientists. The "human interest" angle is why people know who &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_the_plumber"&gt;Sam Wurzelbacher&lt;/a&gt; is. "Human interest" is one of the things that's &lt;i&gt;profoundly wrong&lt;/i&gt; about news reporting today. It's one thing to conclude a newscast with a fun fluff piece, it's quite another to devote whole time blocks to such programming--as the 24-hour news networks so regularly do, particularly when the interesting human happens to be a celebrity. Reporting in these stories seems to be a matter of finding which person the most compelling conventional narrative can be built around and running with it, regardless of the facts--this is the case with the "lone underdog" style of most anti-vaccination reports, it's the case with most "pulled up by their own bootstraps" stories, and the other common tropes of our culture. The larger effect of this misplaced focus is that we often lose sight of the bigger picture, and we forget that the real-world facts rarely fit well into a comfortingly familiar and simplistic narrative. If Paul Harvey's contribution to media and reporting was promoting the "human interest" story, then I have an even harder time finding his contributions praiseworthy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm of the (apparent minority) opinion that death shouldn't automatically insulate people from deserved criticism, nor should it result in days of glowing, incredibly superlative eulogies. Such whitewashing of the past is dishonest and destructive. Let's remember people for who they are, not who they are made out to be through the rose-tinted glasses of recent loss. And so let's remember Paul Harvey as an eminently successful broadcaster, an excellent speaker, and a fantastic storyteller who told fantastic stories and labeled them "news."&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't believe I left this out before. Despite my problems with the man, he'll always have a special place in my memory because of this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/_8AI0gEcoBY%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1708977822548375545?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236038927462"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/creativity_daydreaming_and_imaginative_play">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f9bd910d146a6d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Creativity, Daydreaming, and Imaginative Play</title><published>2009-03-03T00:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T00:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/creativity_daydreaming_and_imaginative_play" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/h-k-d/3310336516/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3609/3310336516_35fdc42e93_m.jpg" alt="a woman catching a bubble containing a butterfly, around her more bubbles with butterflies in them and some birds and some other less identifiable objects float" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The creativity of people on the spectrum came up in Kristina's post about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/katie_miller_on_autism_and_painting"&gt;Katie Miller's art&lt;/a&gt;, my post about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_languages_of_the_arts"&gt;art as a mode of communication&lt;/a&gt;, and even in the &lt;a href="http://regulus2.azstarnet.com/blogs/puzzlepieces/13466"&gt;speculation about Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;.  In addition to these pieces, Digital Journal published an article &lt;a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/268258"&gt;Autism Speaks With Its Own Creative Voice&lt;/a&gt; that features the &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/139183.php"&gt;NAS art exhibition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.donnawilliams.net"&gt;Donna Williams&lt;/a&gt;' blog.  Creativity has been a central part of my life, always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic then that "lack of imagination" is so often cited as a "feature" of autism--somehow the outwardly observable "lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level" and "Delays or abnormal functioning in...symbolic or imaginative play" has been popularly interpreted as an internal and generalized "lack of imagination."  This idea of "lack of imagination" is indeed so strong that a huge raft of popular science reporting back in May of 2006 proclaimed &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060508/full/news060508-3.html"&gt;autistic brains may daydream less&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="http://medgadget.com/archives/2006/05/autistic_brains.html"&gt;autistic brains don't daydream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The daydreaming article" I admit is a pet example of mine both about deep issues with some autism research and the deep issues with some science reporting.  In the actual research paper &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/21/8275.abstract?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=kenedy+autism&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;sortspec=date&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;Failing to deactivate: Resting functional abnormalities in autism&lt;/a&gt;, the term "daydreaming" is never mentioned; the study is actually about a more general "rest state" for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point, the study design both fails to take into account the possible literal interpretation of verbal instructions by autistic participants (instructions were to look at a cross--an active activity--not to let the mind wander into a rest state), as well as the slow speed at which many people on the spectrum process transitions in modes of thinking; specifically participants were asked to switch between a cognitively demanding task and a "rest state" in 20 to 30 &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; intervals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has the study shown that autistic people don't daydream, or has it shown that autistic people don't switch between a cognitively demanding task and a resting brain state at the same rate of speed as people who are not autistic?  Or perhaps does it show that autistic people consider the directive to focus on a cross to be an exercise that requires active concentration?  Or does it maybe show that autistic people are unable to quiet their thoughts in a stressful situation like being hooked up to a machine in a strange lab?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe all people on the spectrum are super creative.  After all, not all people with other types of disabilities, or people without any disabilities at all, are super creative.  However, there is a clear discrepancy between the concept of "lack of imagination" as a core feature of autism and the reality that many people who have been labeled autistic do clearly creative work.  I feel it's important to consider the definitions of these terms and the context in which they are being used before making sweeping generalizations about the creative capacity of a diverse group of unique human beings.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236038386594"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/02/plutos-atmosphere-is-upside-down/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d7724930e496a92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Pluto’s atmosphere is upside-down!</title><published>2009-03-02T23:54:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T23:54:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/02/plutos-atmosphere-is-upside-down/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pluto is a weird place. On average, it’s about 6 billion kilometers from the Sun, so it’s very, very cold there. It’s amazing it has an atmosphere at all… but even that is weird. Pluto’s orbit is an ellipse, and right now — even though it’s slowly pulling away from the Sun — it’s still near the point in its orbit when it’s closest to the Sun. The ever-so-slight increase in heat has warmed the solid surface,  turning it into gas, pumping up Pluto’s thin air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-08-09.html"&gt;astronomers have been able to measure that atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; with uncanny accuracy, all the way down to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artist impression of the surface of Pluto. Credit: ESO/L. Calçada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the ESO’s Very Large Telescope together with a spectrometer that has extraordinary resolution — the ability to distinguish very small differences in the wavelength, or &amp;quot;color&amp;quot;, of infrared light — they’ve been able to make a map of the whole atmosphere from the surface of Pluto all the way up to the top. What they’ve found in general is interesting: the atmosphere is about -170 Celsius, or 50 degrees &lt;em&gt;warmer&lt;/em&gt; than the surface! That’s not exactly warm, of course; it’s just barely above the condensation temperature of nitrogen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s really odd, though, is that the atmospheric temperature goes &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; with height, which is more or less the opposite of the Earth, where the temperature (in the lower atmosphere) decreases with increasing height. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, Pluto’s atmosphere is upside down. This temperature inversion is due to a process like sweating: as sweat evaporates, it cools our skin. On Pluto, the frozen gas sublimates (turns directly to gas) when warmed, removing heat from the surface. So the surface cools, and the atmosphere warms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s more: they found that by number, about 0.5% of the atmosphere is methane, a number which was previously not known. In other words, there is one methane molecule for every 199 nitrogen molecules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty astonishing measurement to make. Pluto is a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; way off, and its atmosphere is about 1/100,000&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; as thick as Earth’s; it’s almost, but not quite, a vacuum. Yet there’s enough there, with the right constituents, to profoundly affect how the object behaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to make confident measurements of such a thin soup from so far away is another testament to how advanced our science really is. Because we’re curious apes, we have reached out to an iceball 40 times farther from the Sun than we are and taken its measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’re doing even more. In 2015, &lt;a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/"&gt;the New Horizons probe&lt;/a&gt; will fly past Pluto and its small cadre of moons, taking close up pictures and sampling its environment. These new observations using the VLT will help scientists prepare even better for the fleeting encounter, so that we can maximize the brief time the spacecraft will be near this signpost of the outer solar system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s truly incredible to think of what we can do, simply because we’re curious.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236037808444"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2872237990787868325">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d1c8faa8d07eaf7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Are My Arguments Really Emotional and Superficial?</title><published>2009-03-02T22:27:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-03T12:36:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/5MtA5nlj9Xk/are-my-arguments-really-emotional-and.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/2872237990787868325/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=2872237990787868325" title="13 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/are-my-arguments-really-emotional-and.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Some Christians have basically charged that I left the fold for emotional reasons and that my book is superficial. In talking to Norman Geisler, a former student &lt;a href="http://www.theologyweb.com/campus/showpost.php?p=2297393&amp;amp;postcount=1"&gt;had this to say&lt;/a&gt; about his recommendation of my book.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't deny Geisler thinks this. He said as much in a series of personal email exchanges. But I think many of the arguments used by some of the top Christian apologists and philosophers are superficial too. Bill Craig even called J.L. Mackie's argument against miracles "shockingly superficial"! Really? That is shocking to even read that. Mackie's arguments are not superfical at all. I find them persuasive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where does that get us? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My case rests upon the fact that we simply "see" things differently, and I argue in the first half of my book for why I see things differently. We see through a particular cultural set of controls beliefs. I have an anti-supernatural bias. Christians have a supernatural bias. The real debate is on settling that particular question. No other atheist author that I know of seems to appreciate that point but me, at least not to where s/he will spend over half of a book defending an anti-supernatual bias before looking at the Biblical evidence in the later half of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yes. Intelligent Design provides an alternative explanation to evolution, which is just a theory. It's healthy to give students a choice. (3 responses)
 17.6%&lt;br&gt;
No. Evolution is a time-tested scientific theory, like gravity. Intelligent design is inspired by religion and has no place in a science classroom. (13 responses)
 76.5%&lt;br&gt;
Not sure. I don't know enough about either subject to make an informed choice. (1 responses)
 5.9%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aaargh. "Just a theory" again; and the claim that ID is an "alternative explanation" is about as true and as relevant as claiming that the "my socks are so grungy, they evolved intelligence, built a time machine, and flew back to the Hadean era to seed life on earth" explanation is a reasonable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the grungy socks. Maybe this is the alternative we need to teach in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers at the &lt;a href="http://www.usc.edu"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; (USC) and &lt;a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt; have found that, when a specific gene variant, the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene&amp;amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;amp;list_uids=4233"&gt;MET gene&lt;/a&gt;, is disrupted, this may "contribute to a syndrome that includes autism and co-occurring gastrointestinal dysfunction." Records from 214 families in the &lt;a href="http://www.agre.org/"&gt;Autism Genetic Resource Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (AGRE) were examined.  In the brain, the MET gene plays a role in circuits involved in social behavior and communication; it also assists in the development and repair of the gastrointestinal system. Says principal investigator Pat Levitt in today's &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090302090222.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"....However, our study is the first to bring together genetic risk for autism and co-occurring GI disorders in a way that provides a biologically plausible explanation for why they are seen together so often."&lt;br&gt;
.....&lt;br&gt;
"We believe that there are other genes that will help identify different subgroups of individuals who have autism spectrum disorder......We also believe that there needs to be research looking at whether the children with co-occurring GI dysfunction and autism have unique features that will help us predict what treatments will be best for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his reading of information about autism on the web back in 1999, Jim noted that a number of people mentioned that. it seemed, autistic children had diarrhea or other GI problems. Over the years, it's seemed that many people have noted to us that their children on the spectrum have GI problems, and many have noted that their children don't. Sometimes we've realized that Charlie's had a tough day because his stomach must have been bothering him all day, and he doesn't communicate this in words---so what could be a GI issue seems also equally, possibly, to be a communication issue?&lt;/p&gt;

He plead to excessive cruelty to animals, after being charged with running a high-stakes dog fighting ring. Included in his indictment were acts such as shooting a dog in the face; drowning, fatally electrocuting and hanging dogs for not performing up to his standards.  Not only is there still a hall dedicated in his honor at Virginia Tech, but he may be welcomed back into the NFL, with open arms, as early as July of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While certainly the decision to let him play again is the NFL’s to make. They have to weigh the pros and cons of letting him back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you might want to consider the case of Pete Rose, a man accused of gambling on his own baseball team. He was never charged or convicted of illegal gambling. Although he holds the record for the most hits in MLB history, he will never be allowed into the Hall of Fame. He has been permanently banned from baseball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark McGwire used steroids to improve his game. Cheating or not, back in 1998 he and Sammy Sosa put on a great show that had America enamored with baseball again. But because of steroid use, he will likely never make the Hall of Fame either. The mere mention of his name is likely to be received with an eyeroll and a headshake. There is very little love for McGwire these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to say that the name Michael Vick doesn’t evoke strong emotion, but how are gambling and steroids worse for a person’s career than what Michael Vick did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you believe Michael Vick should be allowed to play in the NFL again? Do you believe that a double standard for athletes and celebrity entertainers exists? Does thata double standard apply more to football players?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236025556461"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/at_last_a_school_board_agenda.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/714357796e4e46dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">At last, a school board agenda I can fully support</title><published>2009-03-02T19:13:13Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T19:13:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/BxVUD508e58/at_last_a_school_board_agenda.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/at_last_a_school_board_agenda.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our local school boards tend to be institutions of endless tedium punctuated by madness.

The topic is important enough that many of us in the medical blogosphere are going to be talking about this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when President Obama said something about returning science to it’s rightful place?  Well, our new president has a real tough climb ahead of him.  The previous administration shoved science aside for political expediency and religious ideology.  Now, forces in the president’s own party are trying to insert their own quasi-religious beliefs into health care reform, leaving science in &lt;a href="http://widnesskips.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/landfill3.jpg"&gt;a whole different place altogether.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the deal.  Some years back, Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) helped set up the  National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).  The whole idea of setting up such an agency is a bit quixotic—after all, the National Institutes of Health already study health science.  As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=nccam"&gt;my colleagues and I have written many times before&lt;/a&gt;, the very idea of the agency seems ridiculous.  Many, many studies have been funded which fail basic tests of plausibility and ethical propriety.  Also, a huge percentage of the studies funded fail to ever publish their results.  Still, some studies have been published, and more often than not, they find that the “alternative” modality being studied fails to behave better than placebo.  That’s probably the sole redeeming quality of the agency, but not enough to keep it open, as these studies could have been done under the auspices of the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Senator Harkin agrees with me on one point: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=293"&gt;NCCAM is failing to validate many alternative modalities&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is that I find it heartening and Harkin finds it disturbing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.”(from &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;last week’s hearings&lt;/a&gt;, time marker approx. 17:20)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least he’s honest.  He comes right out and bemoans the fact that science hasn’t upheld his quasi-religious medical beliefs.  He just doesn’t get it.  If you choose to investigate a scientific question, you have to be prepared for “bad news”.  You don’t get to decide the outcome before the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harkin makes his goals very clear, from &lt;a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c"&gt;his prepared statement&lt;/a&gt;, to the “experts” from whom he took testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin makes clear that these hearing are meant to guide health care reform—this isn’t some show hearing.  Let’s start with his prepared statement, and I’ll just touch on a few highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is time to end the discrimination against alternative health care practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is time for America’s health care system to emphasize coordination and continuity of care, patient-centeredness, and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And it is time to adopt an integrative approach that takes advantage of the very best scientifically based medicines and therapies, whether conventional or alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This familiar trope is right out of the Gary Null playbook.  There is no “discrimination” against alternative health care.  In fact, alternative health care enjoys a lack of oversight and regulation inconceivable in any real health field.  Still, many doctors (such as myself) do scorn altmed—because it is a fairy tale.  There is no alternative medicine; only medicine that has been proved to work, and medicine that has not.  Then he links his fantasy “discrimination” with reasonable goals, such as coordination and continuity of care, making it seem as if the “mainstream” medical community would throw out basic tenets of medicine along with radical cult practices, such as homeopathy. And his stated wish to take advantage of the  best in science-based therapies is belied by his complaint that NCCAM has failed to validate his pet alternative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then invokes the meme of “giving people what they want”—you know, the old &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=287"&gt;health care freedom gambit&lt;/a&gt;, where quacks argue that patients should be given the freedom to choose crappy care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin’s choice of speakers certainly shore up his credentials as a believer in cult medicine. &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;Let’s take a look.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/EMKstatement.pdf"&gt;Dr. Mehmet Oz&lt;/a&gt;, current darling of Oprah. The guy likes to make very nice sounding pronouncements which often have little to do with science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason is that Americans are twice as sick as Europeans as a people because of our chronic disease burden. Since lifestyle choices drive 70% of the aging process, most experts agree that we should focus on what we put in our mouths (food and addictions), how we tune our engines (exercise and sleep) and how we cope with stress (community and psychological growth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begging the question a few times, Doctor.  Are Americans twice as sick as Europeans?  What would it mean to be twice as sick?  What is a “chronic disease burden”?  What does it even mean that “lifestyle choices” drive the aging process? And 70%?  The entire statement is meaningless, unscientific drivel.  He focuses a lot on the wishful and empty topic of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=346"&gt;longevity medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  And a visit from a quack wouldn’t be complete without an appeal to authority and a sales pitch—Oz shows a picture of a left ventricular assist device, the kind he has presumably installed in patients, to show what a bright guy he is.  That’s great, but being an expert in cardiac surgery doesn’t make you an expert in preventative medicine.  Then of course he shows a picture of his book.  Maybe Congress should buy one for every American!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, Dr. Mark Hyman, expert in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=271"&gt;“functional medicine”&lt;/a&gt;. Functional medicine is a newer approach to unscientific medicine, and rests on many of the common myths popular in various health cults, such as the myth that mainstream medicine only treats “symptoms” of disease and not the “disease” itself (whatever that may mean).  Dr. Hyman invokes the language of Kuhn, calling for a “paradigm shift.”  Here, let’s look at his own words (in the same testimony  during which he calls for large-scale funding of his cult):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way of doing medicine, or Functional medicine, is a system of personalized, patient centered care based on how our environment and lifestyle choices act on our genes to create imbalances in our core biologic systems. Those imbalances show up as the signs and symptoms we call disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s very pretty, but doesn’t actually mean anything.  His testimony shows a complete lack of understanding of the actual causes of disease, and ignorance of evidence-based prevention and treatment.  His “paradigm shift” would shift us right back to the 17th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dean Ornish.  They called in Ornish. Really it’s more of the same.  He gives another impassioned plea for ending the madness, the madness of treating sick people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research, and the work of others, have shown that our bodies have a remarkable capacity to begin healing, and much more quickly than we had once realized, if we address the lifestyle factors that often cause these chronic diseases. Medicine today focuses primarily on drugs and surgery, genes and germs, microbes and molecules, but we are so much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes, germs, microbes, molecules…all those hard, science-y things.  Does he have a diet to keep me from throwing up in my mouth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because the above assault on science-based medicine isn’t enough, they called the bearded guru of Arizona, Dr. Andrew Weil.  He, of course, delivers the same old story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For practitioners of IM [integrative medicine], preventing disease is not an afterthought, it is the cornerstone of our practice - the physician and patient form an ongoing partnership to maintain health, rather than fight illness, and IM practitioners are trained to be agents of lifestyle change. We treat illness promptly and aggressively when appropriate, but always seek to maximize the body’s innate capacity to stay healthy and resist disease and injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy’s a great salesman.  He knows how to tell the best kind of lie—the one that contains a kernel of truth.  The implication that real doctors don’t focus on prevention is ridiculous.  When I see my diabetics, I make sure I examine their feet (thereby preventing amputation), I make sure they see the eye doctor (preventing blindness), and I make sure their blood pressure and cholesterol is under control (preventing stroke and heart attack).  It would be lovely if I could have prevented them from being diabetic in the first place, however some people have trouble with all those pesky genes and molecules and end up diabetic despite their best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very disturbing development.  A horribly anti-science Republican administration has been replaced by a Democratic administration that promised to respect science.  They also have a real mandate for health care reform.  If this is how they are going to use their mandate, to give their &lt;em&gt;imprimatur&lt;/em&gt; to cult medicine and to marginalize science-based medicine, we might have been better off with the devil we knew.&lt;/p&gt;

Written by a member of the faculty at a large state university, the essay notes that faculty members, like other earthlings, have only 24 hours per day, many of which are taken up with crucial activities like research, teaching, and responding to student work.  If new assessment tasks are to be added to faculty duties (as they routinely are, at least at universities like my own), it suggests that the administrators or committees adding them think faculty have infinite stores of time and energy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They don't!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the essay argues, those looking for additional assessment need to make reality-based plans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From now on, all plans for assessment should come with plans for who is going to do the labor, where the labor time is going to come from, and, if need be, who will pay for it. This side of any assessment plan should be as detailed as the requirements for assessing itself, including an estimate of the added number of hours required for the assessment, as the IRS estimates the time to do our taxes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing, if new assessment mandates took account of the real costs, there might be more demand on the front end to assess whether the assessment was worth the projected costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a good essay.

Here are a few not-so-big but IMO interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Northern Virginia Magazine published &lt;a href="http://www.northernvirginiamag.com/health-and-beauty/health-beauty-features/2009/02/19/aspergers-syndrome/"&gt;Am I On the Wrong Planet?&lt;/a&gt; featuring both some familiar folks from the autistic adult community like Alex Plank of &lt;a href="http://wrongplanet.com"&gt;Wrong Planet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autisticselfadvocacynetwork-virginia.blogspot.com/"&gt;Paula C. Durbin-Westby&lt;/a&gt;, and some less familiar folks with an AS diagnosis from ages 6 to 50.  I quite agree with Plank's advice to the newly diagnosed, "Get online, and read other people's stories. It's also a good place to make friends." Not so keen am I however on the article's teaser "born without the ability to empathize" bit.  If I could pick one myth about us to dispel, that would be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Because I can't resist anything about artists, &lt;a href="http://www.shelbystar.com/news/peggy_37316___article.html/first_didn.html"&gt;Autistic man finds voice through art&lt;/a&gt; featuring Scott Washington and his art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In news of art about, not by, people on the spectrum, &lt;a href="http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6640454.html?industryid=47052"&gt;an interview with author Francisco X. Stork&lt;/a&gt; about his book &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vIMfPAAACAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Marcelo+in+the+Real+World&amp;amp;ei=JnqrSZ76E4jClQSUo5CYBQ&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marcelo in the Real World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the character "Marcelo" is identified in the interview as having AS).  I've not read the book so can't write anything about the book.  However, I can write the "saintly by mere virtue of having a disability" thing is a stereotype I've always found disturbing.  On a totally different tangent from the book, Stork apparently spent time living at &lt;a href="http://larcheusa.org/"&gt;L'Arche&lt;/a&gt;, an intentional community where people who have an intellectual or developmental disability and people who do not live together.  I have been intending to post more in depth about L'Arche one of these days--perhaps the Stork article will give me the kick in the pants to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236018159604"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8052108847746528156">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e1e9175036b1e18</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Liberal Party Policy Development Workshop</title><published>2009-03-02T18:11:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T18:20:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/liberal-party-policy-development.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8052108847746528156/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8052108847746528156" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;ll be this evening.WHEN:Monday, March 2, 20097:30 - 10:00 PMWHERE:Mississauga Central LibraryMeeting Room #3, second floor  PRICE:Cost: $5 (to recover room and refreshment costs)CONTACT:For more information, please contact Sharon McCarthy 905 828 5786Omar Alghabra 416 564 5468NOTES:The Mississauga-Erindale Federal Liberal Riding Association is organizing an informative and</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236017092084"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2825206310254747428">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/038cebaed552e862</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="War" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Can We Win in Afghanistan?</title><published>2009-03-02T17:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T18:03:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-we-win-in-afghanistan.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2825206310254747428/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2825206310254747428" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> It&amp;#39;s seems like only a few years ago (March 6, 2006) when Prime Minister Stephen Harper said this ...

Hello? Hello? Free publicity here! Sigh.), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1zuAQAhhMI"&gt;but it’s worth clicking to see this clip&lt;/a&gt; of the brilliant comic (and even better skeptic) Stephen Fry hosting the game-like show &amp;quot;Quite Interesting&amp;quot; — a program where he quizzes comedians over various topics, though it’s really just an excuse to make lots of pretty funny jokes. In this particular clip, he asks the celebrity contestants how many moons the Earth has, and the answer is… well, surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know when you’re done watching, OK? I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, finished? Good. Stephen was talking about the asteroid Cruithne (pronounced GORR-bleccchhh), which orbits the Sun on a path very similar to the Earth’s, but slightly more elliptical. Back when the object was first determined to have this odd orbit, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/3753.html"&gt;I wrote about it on the BA News page.&lt;/a&gt; It wasn’t named Cruithne yet, so you won’t see the name there, but the basic idea is how this object is not really a moon of Earth, but not totally independent of us either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/stephenfry_qi.jpg" alt="Stephen Fry on QI"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;We have late-breaking news…it’s evidently &lt;br&gt; pronounced Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky p’kang! &lt;br&gt;Zroop-boing! mrowvm…&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact — and I hate to say this, as &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/stephenfry"&gt;I follow Stephen on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (heck, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; does), I like him very much, and I’m fond of his personal assistant, too — but his information on the show was wrong! There are at least &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; other objects like this, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/08/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-the-earth/"&gt;but in fact none of them is really a moon of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; (see item 7 on that list). They aren’t bound to the Earth gravitationally, so they aren’t moons. We don’t really have a name for this type of object, as far as I know — a fact I find interesting, as in general classes of asteroids with similar orbits are typically named after the first one of their kind discovered. Maybe nobody can pronounce Cruithne (it’s actually pronounced GLAVIN-heyhey) so they didn’t want a class named after it. I’ll note, to be fair, that at least one of these objects was discovered after that episode of QI aired, but some were known beforehand. Still and all, the point is that these objects are definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; moons of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/44/index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/hubble_lmc_starfield.jpg" alt="Hubble LMC starfield"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I can’t leave without pointing out the background image they use in that clip; I recognized it immediately. &lt;a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/44/index.html"&gt; It’s a Hubble picture&lt;/a&gt;, one I’m intimately familiar with (check &lt;a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/44/bio/bio_plait.html"&gt;the Biographies link&lt;/a&gt; for that image). I wrote &lt;a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/44/supplemental.html"&gt;the supplemental essay&lt;/a&gt; for that picture, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to see it unexpectedly like that. I worked so hard on that data I got sick of it — my task was to count the stars in it and get their positions and brightnesses at various wavelengths, and I spent a long time writing buggy code that never quite did the trick — but now I can appreciate the picture for how pretty it is. In fact, I think the image probably did better as just a pretty picture than any impact it had scientifically. Certainly it was seen by more people as a backdrop for QI than read about it in the astronomy journals! And &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; something that is, really, Quite Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;And hey! Pssst. Stephen! If you read this, tweet a link to it and I’ll release you from your coffee-making duties. Ask your PA for details.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He now &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2009/02/sen-harkin-national-center-for-alternative-medicine-disproves-too-much-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;regrets the effort&lt;/a&gt;, but for all the wrong reasons. It's hard to imagine a more damning statement that reveals an utter ignorance of how science should work than this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Tom Harkin, the proud father of the National Center for Complimentary and Alternative Medicine, told a Senate hearing on Thursday that NCCAM had disappointed him by disproving too many alternative therapies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short,"&lt;/span&gt; Harkin said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The senator went on to lament that, since its inception in 1998, the focus of NCCAM has been &lt;span&gt;"disproving things rather than seeking out and approving things."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Skeptics have complained all along that Harkin and his allies founded this office to promote alternative therapies at public expense, not to test them scientifically. Harkin's statement at the hearing explicitly confirms that hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's unhappy because the research didn't give him the answer he wanted. Does he think science is a magic wishing well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need to establish a new political party, the Rationalists, to replace both the Democrats and Republicans. It would be a wonderful idea, but I fear it would never get more than 0.001% of the American vote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/an_honest_admission_from_senat.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UBgJDAL-ofw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236015224454"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6307">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/549904ac9f9117b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links elsewhere"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="economy"/><category term="recession"/><title type="html">Bostonist: Psychics Loving the Boom Times</title><published>2009-03-02T17:30:10Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T17:30:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6307" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, look, the Boston Globe discovers a 4-month old story and does nothing to make it any smarter. This inspired my post today on Bostonist, which begins . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an interesting story: as the economy plunges into a recession and people panic over the prospect of lost jobs and money, psychics continue to make big money. Well, okay - it was a mildly interesting story when &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97524966"&gt;NPR’s Day to Day covered it in November of last year&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href="http://cbs4denver.com/local/psychics.economy.business.2.899843.html"&gt;a CBS affiliate did it in January&lt;/a&gt; it was somewhat less fresh. By the time &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/02/05/psychics.economy/index.html"&gt;CNN wrote about it back in February&lt;/a&gt;, let’s face it, much of the appeal was gone. Yesterday, when &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/03/01/for_psychics_financial_future_in_the_cards/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Local+news"&gt;Boston Globe writer Brian MacQuarrie&lt;/a&gt; found it in the back of the fridge, sniffed it, and tossed it the microwave for 90 seconds, it was probably time to throw it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how this story is always written, and will probably continue to be written until we return to boom times: the economy is bad, people are worried about the future, they seek solace in the supernatural, they drop a lot of cash, the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thought: might future versions of this story be more interesting if they explored whether or not people are getting their money’s worth?&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore it is a problem to get a really random number into a computer when you need one. A common source, looking at the hundredth of seconds in the computer's clock, is not all that good as it leads to predictability if you pull two numbers from the hat with a recurrent time interval between them. You really need to link the computer to something non-digital if you want real randomness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A legendary 80s science fiction computer game, &lt;i&gt;Elite&lt;/i&gt;, used pseudo-randomness to generate its world. The game has next to no data on-board as it wouldn't fit into the tiny work memory of the era's home computers. Instead it has a random-number generator that is hard-wired to start with the same input value every time it's run. Thus, instead of generating a new set of numbers every time, it reliably recreates the same fictional universe with the star systems Lave and Leesti and its edible mountain poets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once came across a hypothesis (whose status among neuroscientists today I do not know) that the human brain likewise has a localised "crazy box" that allows for creativity while the rest of the wetware works on computer-like principles. According to this hypothesis, your creativity will increase if you perturb the brain's function and allow the crazy box to have greater influence over the machine's output. Thus the Skaldic Mead and &lt;i&gt;Sgt. Pepper&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;On the Road&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://random.org/"&gt;Random.org&lt;/a&gt; offers an on-line random number generator for all your creative needs. It takes the numbers from atmospheric noise picked up by three analog radio receivers. Better than perturbing your brain!&lt;/p&gt;

For a while now, Allyson’s day job has been as an administrator and &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2008/12/behold-my-data-for-it-is-mighty.html"&gt;conference organizer&lt;/a&gt; for groups of scientists and engineers — a task of uncertain rewards which, for whatever murky reasons, she &lt;a href="http://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2008/11/the-universe-ma.html"&gt;truly seems to love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a lab secretary. If I’m your lab’s secretary, I have access to your credit cards, your CV, your passport, and your society memberships. I could write a crackpot paper about string theory and its effects on pineapple custard and publish it under your name on Optics Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn’t do that. My job is to get you to the plane on time so that you can present your brilliant paper on quantum physics and gravity in the solar system to a bunch of people whose lives revolve around fun new uses for cesium fountains. I have no idea what any of it means, but if some government bureaucrat gets in between you and your travels, I will cut a bitch to make sure you get to your conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, through a series of circumstances too forehead-slappingly stupid to be convincingly related here, Allyson is soon going to be out of her current job.  (She gave her notice at her lab, under the impression that an even better gig had been lined up, before the rug was pulled out from under her.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So — anyone in the LA area in the market for an extraordinarily talented and dedicated lab secretary?  Whoever ultimately hires Allyson will be extremely lucky, but in this economy jobs don’t come easily.  Things are tough all over, but it’s heartbreaking to see someone so good go jobless through no fault of their own.  Email me and I’ll pass along any leads.  And thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d like to thank the creators of azithromycin for their assistance in my recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now on to more important things – like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti"&gt;Yeti&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wholly mythical and ever elusive Yeti has found a new and reputable ally in trying to convince the world that he/she/it has jumped out of folklore, and into reality. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough"&gt;Sir David Attenborough&lt;/a&gt; is a world famous broadcaster and naturalist (his brother is the actor and director Richard Attenborough) and he has given the Bigfoot true-believers of the world a nice big banner to wave furiously in the face of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attenborough has been the respected face and voice of British natural history programs for more than 50 years. He is best known for writing and presenting &lt;a href="http://www.davidattenborough.co.uk/"&gt;“The Life Series”&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, which collectively form a comprehensive survey of all terrestrial life. He is also a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1157965/Yeti-evidence-convincing-says-wildlife-expert-Sir-David-Attenborough.html"&gt;first reported &lt;/a&gt;on February 28, 2009, Attenborough was quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m baffled by the Abominable Snowman - very convincing footprints have been found at 19,000ft. No-one does that for a joke. I think it’s unanswered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWC-m_zY2Rw"&gt;here is a short clip&lt;/a&gt; of the interview, so you can see and hear it for yourself in its context. What he actually said was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am absolutely baffled by the Abominable Snowman … because very, very convincing footprints have been found. What made them? … Nobody goes up 19,000 feet to make a joke. I think there is an unanswered problem there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic example of how even the truest, most respected scientists can be tricked. Attenborough, a trained scientist and critical thinker, an outspoken defender of evolution over creationism, whose notable awards include: Member of the Order of Merit, Companion of Honour, Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Fellow of the Royal Society, Fellow of Zoological Society of London … this man cannot perceive of a human intervention at 19,000 feet. Why this seems implausible to Attenborough is rather remarkable, and an excellent reminder to us all that every single person in the world is capable of being deceived, either by themselves or by others. It makes no difference as to how studied, revered, and honored a person is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems even more implausible is that Attenborough is making up his mind based on a photograph taken almost 60 years ago. The infamous &lt;a href="http://anomalyinfo.com/articles/sa00006.shtml"&gt;Shipton Photograph&lt;/a&gt;, snapped in 1951, is the single piece of “evidence” that Attenborough (and many others) have deemed as being beyond the possibility of a hoax. To borrow Attenborough’s own words, “very, very convincing footprints” have been made by people all over the world, and the documented evidence of this is abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attenborough’s observation that, “nobody goes up 19,000 feet to make a joke”, while it seems to be simple common sense, does not rule out the possibility that it actually could happen. There were 16 people on the mission (6 of them local Sherpas). Is it impossible that one of these people could have had a hand in the print (no pun intended)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be equally inclined to say that it is implausible that a pair of older Englishman would spend night after night, over the course of years, walking around the fields of Great Britain using a plank and a rope to make shapes in the wheat. What is the likelihood something like that could happen in comparison to a single photograph taken at an exceptionally high altitude?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attenborough is correct in that “there is an unanswered problem there”, but to answer the unanswered by inserting something like the Yeti, with no other direct evidence that such a creature even exists or how it would be possible for such a creature to exist, represents a blind spot in Attenborough’s logical processes. It is an underestimation of the threshold at which people are fooled by what they see. Thank goodness for people like James Randi, who has been one of the world’s greatest teachers of this critically important observation of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attenborough is allowed to explore his fantasies and speculations just like the rest of us, but skeptics are very aware of the law of unintended consequences. The Bigfoot believers of the world will cling on to Attenbororough’s words and wield them high up in the air for everyone to see. If the history of incidents of famous people having lent their credibility to pseudoscience is any indicator, then the damage has been done. Any retraction or correction by Attenborough (if he is even so inclined to make any) will be for naught. Remember Jimmy Carter and his UFO sighting back in 1969? Carter is the “UFO President”, so adopted by MUFON and other extra-terrestrial true believer groups, and Carter will be for as long as UFO’s are part of the culture (i.e. forever). As far as Attenborough and his Yeti comments go, the barn doors are open, and the cows have left the barn. Closing the barn doors now does little good in wrangling up the cows.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236009266410"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/02/time-lapsed-lulin/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0ff3648a017b021</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Time lapsed Lulin</title><published>2009-03-02T15:37:54Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T15:37:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/02/time-lapsed-lulin/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/02/26/comet-lulin-video-watch-the-outgassing-process/"&gt;Universe Today&lt;/a&gt; I saw this video time lapse of comet Lulin as it blows gas off its nucleus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/sO2QIi1f8Cg%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was taken by Joseph Brimacombe, Southern Galactic Telescope Hosting, on February 22, 2009. The solid part of a comet is usually pretty tiny, just a few kilometers across. Bigger than a mountain, but a lot smaller than a moon. But a lot of that solid part is frozen stuff that turns into gas when the comet nears the Sun. It expands, forming a cloud around the solid nucleus. That cloud can be huge– 100,000 kilometers across or more, bigger than planets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gas escapes away from the comet, forming a tail. That tail can get kinks, twists, sheets, ribbons, all kinds of shapes as it moves off. In the video, you really get a sense of the majesty and beauty of this process. As the tail fans out, sometimes it looks like we see part of it on both sides of the comet, but that’s just a perspective effect. Imagine someone with long hair in the wind; their hair forms a comet-like shape behind them. Looking straight at them, face-on, you’d see hair on both sides of their head. That’s more or less what we see with Lulin. You can see the so-called anti-tail in lots of the images posted of Lulin. Try a Google image search and be amazed. This is some gorgeous comet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236009184384"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-356291894277979727">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/21074a0c5419c008</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Free Speech in Ottawa</title><published>2009-03-02T15:31:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T15:51:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/free-speech-in-ottawa.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/356291894277979727/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=356291894277979727" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Some of you might recognize these people in spite of their attempts to disguise themselves!1They are protesting the decision by OC Transpo in Ottawa (Canada) to ban the atheist ads on city buses.

Specifically, it's a report that U. of M. has &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009902270329"&gt;halted the use of dogs in its surgical training:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surgeons training at the University of Michigan Health System will no longer use live, healthy dogs to learn drastic surgical procedures that can save people's lives, the university announced Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;The anesthetized animals -- obtained from shelters -- were used to teach tracheotomies, how to fix collapsed lungs, and other emergency procedures. The animals' injuries from the procedures forced them to be euthanized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As anyone who's read this blog since at least last July knows that I'm a dog lover. Anyone who has any doubt of that should simply go back and read my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/three_uneaten_ears_of_corn.php"&gt;post about the premature death of our dog Echo last summer,&lt;/a&gt; and that should refute all doubts. In fact, it's because I like dogs so much that I've always had a bit of difficulty using dogs in research. I realize that it is not entirely rational. Indeed, as a medical student I experienced a bit of the very training that has now, some 20 years later, come to an end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/animals_in_research_and_medical_training.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/animals_in_research_and_medical_training.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/dKwriXJaFvg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236006577312"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/oh_come_on_american_atheists.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a380d3655b9d2e91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Oh, come on, American Atheists</title><published>2009-03-02T14:46:19Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T14:46:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/If9hO4biTEU/oh_come_on_american_atheists.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/oh_come_on_american_atheists.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The American Atheists web site includes a very silly poll. &lt;a href="http://atheists.org/"&gt;Is Blasphemy a crime?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: 3268
96%&lt;br&gt;
No: 94
2%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it's going in a strongly sensible direction, but wouldn't a short paragraph explaining &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; blasphemy is not an actionable crime be more informative? Just asking atheists to state that their existence is not criminal is a no-brainer. And I sure hope they never try to claim that these results &lt;i&gt;support&lt;/i&gt; the contention that blasphemy is not a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man walks into the police station and says "Officer, I'm pyschic, and I just sensed a murder. It was awful! If you go to 212 Main St. and look in the basement, I'm sure you'll find a man stabbed to death." So the officer brings the psychic along, and upon finding a body there, arrests him. "Why are you arresting me?" the psychic asks. And the officer replies, "If you were really psychic, you'd have known that's what I was going to do, and you wouldn't have come along. And if you're not psychic, you must have killed this guy to know what had happened."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, I've learned from a reliable source that my first instinct was correct: there is actually a new paper in the pipeline from Pagel. I'm not sure whether it presents relevant new results beyond the material in Mark Pagel, Quentin D. Atkinson, and Andrew Meade, "&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7163/abs/nature06176.html"&gt;Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history&lt;/a&gt;", Nature 2007; but at least it would have provided a scientific focus for the PR circus, if the timing had been a bit different. In any case, whenever this paper becomes available, we'll discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236000647394"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/mricon-she-only-looks-half-te/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3de048ff8b780879</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@mricon she only looks half-te…</title><published>2009-03-02T13:27:51Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T13:27:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/mricon-she-only-looks-half-te/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@mricon she only looks half-terrified&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235998295734"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_614.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a80a0d03587e80e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-03-02T12:40:39Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T12:40:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/SHo5QnFnS8E/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_614.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_614.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A study in the March 1 issue of the journal SLEEP suggests the presence of an intrinsic sleep problem specific to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and supports the idea that children with ADHD may be chronically sleep deprived and have abnormal REM sleep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coffee shrubs, both in themselves and because they are most often cultivated in the shade of large trees, can have a positive impact on plant and animal diversity in those parts of the landscape that are deforested and dominated by agriculture.  What constitutes a dilemma for consumers wishing to shop ecologically is that when coffee is grown in a forest, which is also common, the impact on diversity is negative.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_614.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/SHo5QnFnS8E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235997141420"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=487">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3773011566be7b90</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><title type="html">Studying Virtual Communities</title><published>2009-03-02T12:00:35Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T12:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=487" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It certainly seems as if we are living through a transformational period of time. Computers are changing the way we access information, communicate, work, and play. Perhaps the biggest change is the rise of virtual communities - changing the fundamental milieu of our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as much as I feel computers have changed my life, it is nothing compared to the younger generation. I have a vicarious view of how college-age students are reinventing social structures. This goes beyond networking online and endless texting. You now have to learn how to break up on Facebook. You have to worry that your new boyfriend will decide to brag about your exploits in front of the entire online world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid social changes the internet and digital communication bring likely presents a challenge to social scientists, struggling to keep up. But it also presents the promise of new tools to study social behavior. Now researchers from the University of Minnesota have presented their study of social behavior in the massive multiplayer online (MMPO) community, Everquest 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jaideep Srivastava, Noshir Contractor and Scott Poole looked at 60 terabytes of data covering three years of game time, including 300,000 individual players who logged an average of 26 hours per week (displaying the addictive nature of the game that has earned in the nickname “Evercrack”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with MMPOs, they are game worlds in which players create one or more characters who then adventure, either alone or in teams. Players are connected online to a server with hundreds of thousands of other players, all interacting with each other and the game world in real time. Everquest is a fantasy “swords and sorcery” genre game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The games have grown so large and complex, the researchers argue, that social dynamics are now at play. And those dynamics can be studied in unbelievable detail because much of it is logged in the game’s servers. This presents an interesting opportunity that could potentially accelerate the rate of such research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it also present new challenges. Online communities are likely to have interesting differences from real-world communities, and exactly what those differences are will need to be explored in detail. But we should remember that it is still people in those online communities, and those people bring their human nature into the game world with them.  Researchers can now ask - how do people behave in online communities. It remains to be seen, however, what that really tells us about human nature and how it relates to non-virtual communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, game worlds also have their own economies. There is an in-game economy, where players can obtain raw material, make items, and sell them. The principles of supply and demand are clearly at work. However, this in-game economy exists within an out-of-game real-world economy. Specifically, players can pay real money to buy in-game gold for their characters. This “breaks” the in-game economy to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often referred to as Chinese gold, because Chinese companies have workers play the game to amass as much gold as possible then sell it to Western customers. This causes in-game inflation because players now have more gold with which to by material and items and so are willing to pay a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if any economists have thought to study in-game economies the way these researchers have studied in-game communities, but I think it’s inevitable.  Whether or not it’s a good model, the fact that it takes place in a virtual world makes it accessible to study. It’s looking where the light is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also virtual worlds like Second Life, which are not games, really, just an online virtual world. With nothing to do it can be boring and pointless, but many people are finding that the virtual world is very useful for some things - like having online virtual meetings, lectures, and gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the middle of a grand online experiment, as individuals, companies, organizations, and communities explore what works and what does not work online. It’s changing fast. Even as a dedicated technophile I find it hard to keep up, and secretly I’m glad I did not have to go through adolescence living in an online fishbowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad researchers are starting to take a serious look at online communities. Science might give us a bit of a rudder to guide us through the waters ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

Once again the ombudsman decides to defend George Will, but only on &lt;i&gt;a single point&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A key paragraph, aimed at those who believe in man-made global warming, asserted: "According to the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center, global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bizarrely, he acknowledges Will was wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It said that while global sea ice areas are "near or slightly lower than those observed in late 1979," sea ice area in the Northern Hemisphere is "almost one million sq. km below" the levels of late 1979. That's roughly the size of Texas and California combined. In my mind, it should have triggered a call for clarification to the center.

&lt;p&gt;But according to Bill Chapman, a climate scientist with the center, there was no call from Will or Post editors before the column appeared. He added that it wasn't until last Tuesday -- nine days after The Post began receiving demands for a correction -- that he heard from an editor at the newspaper. It was Brewington who finally e-mailed, offering Chapman the opportunity to write something that might help clear the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will's column is grossly dishonest, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/the_global_warming_cranks_-_ge.php"&gt;we and others pointed out&lt;/a&gt; it wasn't just sea ice, but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/02/the_importance_of_actually_rea.php"&gt;the repeated misquote of a scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/02/15/george-will-global-cooling-warming-debunked/"&gt;a whole host&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2009/feb/18/climate-denial-george-will"&gt;of dishonest statements&lt;/a&gt;.  He's apparently been misquoting one paper to push this "global cooling" nonsense since 1992 and basically &lt;a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/02/23/george-will-zombie/"&gt;recycling this same BS article for almost two decades&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander may be correct there is fact checking "on multiple levels", but that does not change that it was incompetent, missed willful errors, and that there has not been a correction of Will's mistakes or a repudiation of his incessant repetition of falsehoods like the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2006/02/they-predicted-cooling-in-1970s.php"&gt;myth of global cooling&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

I spent a good part of Sunday at a workshop with many members and staff of &lt;a href="http://www.autismnj.org"&gt;Autism NJ&lt;/a&gt;, which is New Jersey's largest autism organization. Autism NJ is launching a Listening Tour, with the goal of creating a Blueprint for Lifetime Support Services for individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families. Responses will be sought from individuals, families, and "those connected to the autism community (service providers, professionals, educators, advocates etc.)."  At the Sunday session, we were given a draft of the interview questions and paired with another workshop participant to do  "test" the questions; after lunch, we got into groups and critiqued the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions were all centered on services, on access to them, and on what we felt would be necessary to maintain what we considered "high quality" services for individuals on the spectrum throughout their lifespan. (There was some discussion about what exactly "high quality" services means, with some people noting that, for many individuals and families, just getting &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; is the first, overriding challenge---"access" is the main issue, and "timely access" at that.) Further, there was a quiet, constant theme of emphasizing the positive in all of the questions: We were asked to note when we'd had access to the "highest quality of services and supports" possible. This strategy helped to keep the discussion focused on what works and what we  wished could be in place to keep things working; it forestalled the discussion from devolving into complaints and &lt;em&gt;if only we had this&lt;/em&gt;'s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question was specifically about crisis situations and how these were handled, in our experience. We were asked to rate what we thought about the current level of response to crisis situations we were receiving. This question particularly hit home with me, due to my son's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;past couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/slowly_slowly_thoughts_on_progress"&gt;months&lt;/a&gt;, when Jim and I felt we were stumbling and at a loss as much as we were some ten years ago when Charlie's daycare teachers started to mumble about "something neurological." Then, though, we were stumbling and fumbling and had no idea of what to do, of where to turn: Now, we knew immediately who to contact and what to look into. I noted that, at the moment, the response to Charlie's having a crisis situation is pretty much a 10 (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 "the most appropriate and timely")---if, when, Charlie has a really tough day at school, his teacher calls me even before he gets home and we start to evaluate and strategize. (Whereas, in a former school district, it took about two weeks after Charlie had had a really bad day for us to hear what an "outside external" consultant had to suggest.) (Yes, &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to talk to a number of professionals---therapists and teachers (some of whom noted they are parents of a child on the spectrum, too).  This was extremely instructive to me. I certainly talk with, email, etc. Charlie's teacher a lot, but the conversation is, of course, all about Charlie and his learning and needs. But what does it take to create, run, and maintain educational and other programs for children and individuals on the spectrum? What kinds of qualifications and credentials and supports are needed? How can I as a parent best support the people who help Charlie to learn and grow and be a part of the community----not invisible, in an institutional setting, about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;out and about&lt;/a&gt;----living and working in the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Regarding the latter---here's a story of a &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/maplewood_bookstore_owners_aim.html"&gt;New Jersey father&lt;/a&gt; who opened a bookstore, Words; his 13-year-old son is on the spectrum and the bookstore is designed with special needs kids in mind.) (It's also the only bookstore in the town it's located in---go, independent bookstores!) (Back to the point.......)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview questions are being revised (even as you read this post). I'm planning on interviewing parents (guess who's going to be #1), self-advocates, some teachers and/or therapists, the special education director in our school district, some medical professionals (Charlie's dentist, perhaps? the supervisors of the grocery stores he and I visit to much.....).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've told a great deal of our story here, and &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I know I need to keep listening more---I certainly would like the blueprint that might result to be as well-informed, as well-designed, as reflective of the needs and hopes and wishes of as many as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Corleone in &lt;em&gt;The Godfather, Part 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t planned on doing two vaccine posts with such a short interval between them, but all too often, as the they say in the weakest of the &lt;em&gt;Godfather&lt;/em&gt; movies, I get pulled back in again. So, after noting last week that 2009 was shaping up–fortunately–to be a very &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;bad year for antivaccinationists&lt;/a&gt;, I should have expected a counterattack from the antivaccine fringe. Indeed, the only thing that surprised me after the twin blows of the revelations about &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; on the part of the originator of the claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism, Andrew Wakefield, and the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478"&gt;resounding defeat&lt;/a&gt; of the first three test cases of the Autism Omnibus proceedings, was that it took longer than I had expected. True, a group had formed, proclaiming that “&lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/23/will-patrick-holford-be-calling-upon-his-mailing-list-to-sign-the-new-andrew-wakefield-petition/"&gt;we support Dr. Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;.” Also true, the antivaccine activists at the Age of Autism have been working overtime to attack the Autism Omnibus as being hopelessly rigged. Indeed, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;our “old friend” Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt; has even &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/there-is-no-proof-that-ci_b_167157.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;likened attempts to refute antivaccine pseudoscience to tobacco companies’&lt;/a&gt; P.R. and astroturf campaigns back in the 1950s through 1980s to cast doubt on the strong scientific and epidemiological evidence showing that cigarettes cause lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those contortions of science, epidemiology, law, and logic were merely a warmup for the real counterattack. On February 25, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; purchased this &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/generation-rescue-ad-in-usa-today-court-again-concedes-vaccines-cause-autism.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;full page ad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27470541@N02/3318450038/" title="GenRescue_ad by David SBM, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="GenRescue_ad" height="676" width="350" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3377/3318450038_040ac62920_o.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the advertisement above was only the beginning. &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; managed to team up the chief progagandist for the antivaccine movement, &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, along with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whom I have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=198"&gt;discussed before&lt;/a&gt; for his total support of the antivaccine movement. The question then becomes: Where would these two team up to spread their message against vaccines? Do you even have to ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their twin articles appear on that repository of all things antivaccine, The Huffington Post, under the title &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html"&gt;Vaccine Court: Autism Debate Continues&lt;/a&gt;. As I will explain, these twin articles represent yet another example of what I have at times referred to as the “incredibly shrinking vaccine-autism hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look first at the article by RFK, Jr., &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html"&gt;Another Autism Case Wins in Vaccine Court&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times joined the government Health Agency (HRSA) and its big pharma allies hailing the decisions as proof that the scientific doubts about vaccine safety had finally been “demolished.” The US Department of Health and Human services said the rulings should “help reassure parents that vaccines do not cause autism.” The Times, which has made itself a blind mouthpiece for HRSA and a leading defender of vaccine safety, joined crowing government and vaccine industry flacks applauding the decisions like giddy cheerleaders, rooting for the same court that many of these same voices viscously derided just one year ago, after Hannah Poling won compensation for her vaccine induced autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last week, the parents of yet another child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were awarded a lump sum of more than $810,000 (plus an estimated $30-40,000 per year for autism services and care) in compensation by the Court, which &lt;a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BANKS_CASE.pdf"&gt;ruled that the measels-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine had caused acute brain damage&lt;/a&gt; that led to his autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=66"&gt;Hannah Poling case&lt;/a&gt; all over again, except this time the antivaccine movement is not rebranding autism as a mitochondrial disorder. What it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; trying to rebrand autism as again, you will see in a moment. In the meantime, RFK, Jr. spins and twists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family of 10-year-old Bailey Banks won their case quietly and without fanfare in June of 2007, but the ruling has only now come to public attention. In the remarkably clear and eloquent decision, Special Master Richard Abell ruled that the Banks had successfully demonstrated that “the MMR vaccine at issue actually caused the conditions from which Bailey suffered and continues to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey’s diagnosis is Pervasive Developmental Disorder — Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) which has been recognized as an autism spectrum disorder by CDC, HRSA and the other federal health agencies since at least the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervasive_developmental_disorder_not_otherwise_specified"&gt;PDD-NOS&lt;/a&gt; is indeed one of the conditions that fall under the category of disorders known as autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) and is thus considered an ASD. The ruling concluded that, in the case of Bailey Banks, the MMR had caused a condition  known as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Here is the &lt;a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BANKS_CASE.pdf"&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt; that RFK, Jr. quotes in his HuffPo article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court found that Bailey’s ADEM was both caused-in-fact and proximately caused by his vaccination. It is well-understood that the vaccination at issue can cause ADEM, and the Court found, based upon a full reading and hearing of the pertinent facts in this case, that it did actually cause the ADEM. Furthermore, Bailey’s ADEM was severe enough to cause lasting, residual damage, and retarded his developmental progress, which fits under the generalized heading of Pervasive Developmental Delay, or PDD [an autism spectrum disorder]. The Court found that Bailey would not have suffered this delay but for the administration of the MMR vaccine, and that this chain of causation was… a proximate sequence of cause and effect leading inexorably from vaccination to Pervasive Developmental Delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an exact quote of what Special Master Richard Abell’s ruling. Note the term “an autism spectrum disorder” in brackets. There’s just one problem. PDD is not an autistic spectrum disorder. Let’s look at the very beginning of the Special Master’s ruling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 26 June 2002, the Petitioner filed a petition for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Vaccine Act or Act)2 alleging that, as a result of the MMR vaccination received on 14 March 2000, his child, Bailey, suffered a seizure and Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (”ADEM”),3 which led to Pervasive Developmental Delay (”PDD”), a condition from which he continues to suffer (the “Petition”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the difference. The claim in the ruling is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that ADEM led to pervasive developmental &lt;em&gt;disorder&lt;/em&gt;, not otherwise specialized (PDD-NOS). The ruling is about pervasive developmental &lt;em&gt;delay&lt;/em&gt; (PDD). The difference is more than a matter of semantics, as &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1917"&gt;Kev&lt;/a&gt; points out. PDD is not the same thing as PDD-NOS. In fact, the ruling itself makes this point very, very clear in one of its footnotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) is a ’subthreshold’ condition in which some - but not all - features of autism or another explicitly identified Pervasive Developmental Disorder are identified. PDD-NOS is often incorrectly referred to as simply “PDD.” The term PDD refers to the class of conditions to which autism belongs. PDD is NOT itself a diagnosis, while PDD-NOS IS a diagnosis. The term Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS; also referred to as “atypical personality development,” “atypical PDD,” or “atypical autism”) is included in DSM-IV to encompass cases where there is marked impairment of social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behavior patterns or interest, but when full features for autism or another explicitly defined PDD are not met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, PDD-NOS is a &lt;a href="http://old.nichcy.org/pubs/factshe/fs20txt.htm"&gt;subset of PDD&lt;/a&gt;, but there are other forms of PDD. This is what RFK, Jr. says about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey’s diagnosis is Pervasive Developmental Disorder — Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) which has been recognized as an autism spectrum disorder by CDC, HRSA and the other federal health agencies since at least the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not. Read the &lt;a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BANKS_CASE.pdf"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, the terms PDD and PDD-NOS seem to be used almost interchangeably and sloppily so, but latching on to that doesn’t “prove” anything. In fact, if you read through the ruling, you’ll also see that even the facts of the case do not represent the slam dunk that RFK, Jr. seems to think they do. Indeed, the Special Master even acknowledges that and feels the need to justify his decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their accord on certain factual predicates contained in Bailey’s medical records, there is, unsurprisingly, a pronounced conflict between the parties as to the following issues: whether a biologically plausible link exists between ADEM and pervasive developmental delay (PDD) in a direct chain of causation, whether Bailey did in fact suffer from ADEM, and ultimately whether the administration of the MMR vaccine to Bailey actually caused ADEM which would then cause PDD that currently besets Bailey today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Special Master Abell referred to PDD as “pervasive developmental &lt;em&gt;delay&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll grant you (and even the antivaccine movement) that Abell seems to flip back and forth between using PDD to mean pervasive developmental delay or PDD-NOS in a confusing manner, trying to explain himself in the footnotes and failing. My point is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that Bailey Banks doesn’t have PDD-NOS. Rather, it is that the antivaccine fringe reads far more into the terminology than is warranted. Reading the entire judgment, whatever neurological disorder Bailey has, I consider it arguable whether Bailey actually has an ASD. He very well might have PDD-NOS; he might not. In fact, the title of the ruling should tell you how sure Special Master Abell was that the MMR caused Bailey Banks’ autism: &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/bailey-banks-his-father-kenneth-banks-v-secretary-health-and-human-services-020738v"&gt;Non-autistic developmental delay; Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis; Expert Credibility; Evidentiary Reliability; Scientific Validity; Burden of Proof; Causation in Fact; Proximate Causation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, even if Bailey does have PDD-NOS, the chain of causality gets more strained when we consider ADEM. For one thing, it’s not even entirely clear that Bailey actually had ADEM, as the testimony in the case reveals. However, clearly something happened; so, for the sake of argument, let’s say for the moment that he definitely did suffer a vaccine-induced incident of ADEM. Here’s where the problem comes in: There’s close to no scientific literature to support an epidemiological or pathologic link between ADEM or PDD (or PDD-NOS, for that matter). Basically, the ruling is best read as saying that in this case MMR &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., with a 51% or more probability)  caused Bailey’s ADEM, a rare condition after vaccination that is compensable, and that Bailey’s ADEM further &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; have resulted in PDD or PDD-NOS. That’s a lot different than RFK, Jr.’s confident assertion that this case is a slam-dunk indication that the Vaccine Court has accepted the general principle that vaccines can cause autism. Such nuances undermine the antivaccine spin on the case, however; so they can’t be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find more troubling, however, is this statement in Special Master Abell’s ruling, quoted by David Kirby in his article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Respondent’s expert stated that, although ADEM may result in “permanent neurological sequelae,” nevertheless “all the medical literature is negative in that regard;” however, soon thereafter, he corrected this statement by clarifying, “I can find no literature relating ADEM to autism or [PDD].” Tr. at 84-85. It may be that Respondent’s research reveals a dearth of evidence linking ADEM to PDD, but that is not the same as positive proof that the two are unrelated, something Respondent was unable to produce. Therefore, the statement that “all the medical literature is negative” is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one request of anyone who fervently believes that the Vaccine Court is overwhelmingly biased against the petitioners who bring cases before it. Read the above paragraph. Then read it again. Then read it over and over. That single paragraph tells you all you need to know about the true attitude and “bias” of the Vaccine Court, which most definitely are not what Kirby represents them as. The above paragraph reveals a Special Master of the Vaccine Court bending over backwards to give the petitioner’s experts the benefit of the doubt &lt;em&gt;even in the absence of any positive peer-reviewed medical literature supporting the petitioner’s hypothesis of causation for the vaccine injury claimed&lt;/em&gt;. Abell even appears to be chiding the government’s expert witness for being too particular about actually requiring some evidence published in the peer-reviewed journals to back the petitioner’s claim that the MMR caused ADEM, which resulted in PDD-NOS. Moreover, Abell’s statement above that the observation that there is a “dearth of evidence linking ADEM to PDD, but that is not the same as positive proof that the two are unrelated” suggests that he think that science can ever “positively” prove a negative. It cannot; it can only suggest probabilities. In any case, the Special Master appears to be going beyond even that. He appears to be looking for a reason to reject the Respondent’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong. Special Master Abell’s misunderstanding of how science works aside, for the most part, as a matter of public health policy this bias of the Vaccine Court towards granting petitioners’ claims is probably a good thing. After all, if we as a society are going to require mass vaccination programs of our children, even though the benefits far outweigh the risks, there are small risks, and there will always be a small number of adverse events. Children who suffer an adverse event deserve to be compensated in an expeditious fashion. Indeed, the Vaccine Court was set up to do just that by streamlining the compensation process. Given that Bailey had a reaction close enough to his vaccination that the law considers it likely that the vaccination caused it &lt;em&gt;as a matter of law&lt;/em&gt;, it is probably not unreasonable that the Vaccine Court decided to compensate him. But, please, let’s not confuse a &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; ruling with science. As I pointed out when I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;discussed the recent rejection of the claims&lt;/a&gt; of causation by the first three test case petitioners in the Autism Omnibus, I was pleasantly surprised that, in the instance of the Omnibus at least, the law got the science right. Far too often, it does not. The rulings and litigation over silicone breast implants that bankrupted Dow-Corning in the 1990s come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boil it all down, the antivaccine movement is doing nothing other than &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=174"&gt;what it did&lt;/a&gt; in the Hannah Poling case, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=66"&gt;attempting to “rebrand” autism&lt;/a&gt;. RFK, Jr. and David Kirby are throwing people a big red herring. What the court admitted is that Bailey’s seizures occurred soon enough after the MMR to be considered a vaccine injury and accepted that his neurologic problems could be the result. It did not “admit that vaccines cause autism” any more than it did in the Hannah Poling case. Indeed, it bent over backward to give the petitioner every opportunity to come up with a concept of how vaccines might contribute to autism and argue it, primarily based on the relatively close temporal proximity. It even in essence ignored testimony that there was no convincing evidence in the peer-reviewed medical literature linking ADEM to PDD. I did the PubMed searches myself, and there really isn’t much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Kirby, characteristically, is a bit more careful–and, of course, weaselly–about the issue. Clearly he is the smarter and cleverer of the two. What Kirby does is to throw Andrew Wakefield under the bus, metaphorically speaking, at least as far as &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; he claimed that MMR caused autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is vaccine-induced ADEM (and similar disorders) a neurological gateway for a subset of children to go on and develop an ASD? That question will now become subject to debate. Thousands of parents have reported similar reactions and symptoms following vaccination, yet they lack radiological proof of ADEM or related disorders in the form of an MRI. Meanwhile, most children with autism do not present with myelin damage, but many do test positive for antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what were these reactions? Kirby described them earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases of ADEM (80%) are in children. Symptoms usually appear within a few days to a couple of weeks. They include: headache, delirium, lethargy, seizures, stiff neck, fever, ataxia (incoordination), optic nerve damage, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, irritability and changes in mental status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know of thousands of parents who witnessed many of these same symptoms afflict their children shortly after vaccination, most typically the MMR. Did these children with autism also suffer initially from ADEM or some subclinical version of the disorder? We may never know (physical signs like myelin damage are transitory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another “I’m just asking” gambit by David Kirby, the same sort of rhetorical prestidigitation he performed for the Hannah Poling case, connecting condition after condition without any firm scientific evidence that a connection is warranted, each connection getting more tenuous as he continues. He’s also playing a subtler game that that in that he is implicitly attributing all sorts of nonspecific neurological symptoms to “regressive autism” without specifically saying that that’s what he’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at it this way. Again, let’s go beyond what we conceded to the antivaccine movement for the sake of argument. Let’s concede that, in the case of Bailey Banks, MMR caused ADEM, which then lead to PDD-NOS or even full blown autism, exactly as David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. are claiming. Here’s the problem. ADEM occurring after vaccination is very rare–so rare that, epidemiologically, it has been very difficult to determine whether it’s even correlated with a vaccine at all. For example, this &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6TD4-4KJTM8X-7&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=f2d748569b0755651567bfe89e3645f9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; looking at post-marketing adverse events from vaccines in Japan reported the total estimated incidence of serious neurological incidents, including ADEM, encephalitis or encephalopathy, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, after vaccination as being in the range of 0.1-0.2 per million immunization practices. That’s incredibly rare. Fellow SBM blogger &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/02/dumb_and_dangerous---kennedy-k.php"&gt;Dr. Lipson&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out that the incidence of ADEM after measles and some other viral infections is 5,000 to 10,000 times higher than after vaccination, on the order of 1 in 1,000. In other words, &lt;em&gt;even in the worst case scenario and granting every single link between vaccines, ADEM, and ASDs that David Kirby and RFK, Jr. speculate about&lt;/em&gt;, the risk of a child’s suffering a bout of ADEM after getting the measles is several orders of magnitude higher than it is after MMR vaccination–if there even is an elevated risk of ADEM after MMR vaccination at all! By David Kirby’s and RFK, Jr.’s own arguments, vaccination with MMR is vastly safer and vastly less likely to result in neurological sequelae than not vaccinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Kirby has a ready answer for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADEM is said to be rare, but the disorder may be grossly under-diagnosed (or misdiagnosed). Even the government’s chief witness against Bailey’s case testified that he sees patients with ADEM “on a fairly regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the cleverness, so pathognomonic of Kirby’s writing style. ADEM itself may not be incredibly rare, but ADEM associated with vaccination is very rare and much more common after at least one of the diseases that vaccination prevents. At the end of the article, Kirby repeats the sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People will argue that ADEM is rare; that vaccines “only” caused PDD in Bailey; and that this was a legal and not scientific decision. The problem is we don’t know how prevalent ADEM is because we never looked; while “PDD” is interchangeable with “ASD” in the language of public health. And, the three cases that lost were also “legal” decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just plain incorrect. Scientists and doctors &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; looked. There are numerous epidemiological studies and post-marketing surveillance studies looking for neurological sequelae after vaccination, be it with MMR or any other childhood vaccine.  These studies just haven’t found what Kirby wants them to find. I strongly suspect that Kirby’s definition o which is why his definition of “look” is to do CT scans and MRIs on every child brought to the emergency room with any complaint at all after vaccination. Also remember that Bailey underwent an MRI because he had a seizure associated with fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have on occasion referred to the vaccine-autism hypothesis as the “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/vaccines_and_autism_the_incredible_shrin.php"&gt;incredible shrinking causation hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;.” This tag-team assault by two luminaries of the antivaccine movement is yet more evidence of just how puny this hypothesis has become. Remember, the original claim of the antivaccine movement was not that a couple of very rare conditions predispose a child to vaccine injury, which predisposes them to developing autism. It was not that vaccines might cause autism in one or even two in a million children. No! It was that vaccines are a major cause, if not the main cause of an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=340"&gt;alleged “autism epidemic”&lt;/a&gt; that has been going on since the mid-1990s. Of course, the real cause of the apparent increase in autism diagnoses appears to be largely due to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=95"&gt;diagnostic substitution and the broadening&lt;/a&gt; of the diagnostic criteria for autism, but to antivaccine advocates, correlation must equal causation, and the increase in autism diagnoses correlated roughly with an increase in the number of vaccines in the recommended childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=14"&gt;discredited hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that the mercury in the thimerosal preservatives in vaccines causes autism, Generation Rescue, for example, before its shifting of the goalposts declared autism to be a “&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060527112428/http://www.generationrescue.org/index2.html"&gt;misdiagnosis for mercury poisoning&lt;/a&gt;” due to vaccines. After the science became so overwhelming that even antivaccine activists had a hard time blaming autism on thimerosal anymore, GR describes autism in much vaguer terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe these neurological disorders (”NDs”) are environmental illnesses caused by an overload of heavy metals, live viruses, and bacteria. Proper treatment of our children, known as “biomedical intervention”, is leading to recovery for thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of this epidemic of NDs is extremely controversial. We believe the cause includes the tripling of vaccines given to children in the last 15 years (with unstudied ingredients like mercury, aluminum and live viruses); growing evidence also suggests that maternal toxic load and prenatal vaccines, heavy metals like mercury in our air, toxic ingredients in our water, pesticides; and the overuse of antibiotics are also implicated. Generation Rescue’s mission is to support continued research on causative factors and treatment approaches for NDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we have now from the antivaccine movement, now that the thimerosal hypothesis has been &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=14"&gt;discredited scientifically&lt;/a&gt; and Andrew Wakefield’s MMR work has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=200"&gt;been thoroughly repudiated&lt;/a&gt;? Vague ideas about “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;” in vaccines. I want to emphasize it again: What we now see now is truly the incredibly shrinking hypothesis. By latching onto a rare mitochondrial disorder as the “linking factor” between vaccines and autism last year and now latching onto a very rare possible complication of vaccination, ADEM, as a “gateway” to autism, using only a questionable legal ruling and in essence no science, Kirby and Kennedy are showing just how small the vaccine hypothesis for autism has become. Even if such a link exists between the MMR and ADEM and autism and is ultimately scientifically confirmed (unlikely) it could not possibly account for very many cases of autism–just as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=66"&gt;mitochondrial disorders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=174"&gt;couldn’t account for very many cases&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, even more so than neurological complications in children with mitochondrial disorders, neurological complications due to ADEM are more likely to occur in the unvaccinated because measles is more likely in such children. Science, facts, and reason notwithstanding, look for a lot of very bad “science” to pour out of the “labs” of Thoughtful House, Mark and David Geier’s basement, and Boyd Haley’s lab, wherever that may be these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find it rather convenient that the antivaccine movement seemingly forgot all about this particular ruling. After all, the ruling was originally issued in 2007 and Kathleen Seidel even &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/148/"&gt;blogged about it and other similar rulings nearly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. One wonders why &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; waited until now to trot it out. Coincidence? I think not. Here’s what I think, and I believe I have good reason behind my thinking: Pre-Autism Omnibus ruling, even the antivaccine movement considered the Banks case thin gruel, too thin to make much of a stink about. Indeed, if that weren’t the case, the Banks case would almost certainly have received major hype when its ruling was originally announced a year and a half ago. I also don’t buy the argument that this ruling was “hidden.” The antivaccine movement is very aware of rulings made by the Vaccine Court, as they are always looking for a ruling to use. Now, post-Autism Omnibus ruling and Andrew Wakefield revelations, the antivaccine movement needs something to distract people from the drubbing they’ve taken scientifically and legally. So they pull an old ruling out of the closet, tart it up a bit using their post-Poling spin skills, and send it flouncing down the runway in the hope that it impresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that doesn’t work, RFK, Jr. in his own inimitable fashion cranks up the paranoia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the vaccine court is mandated to fairly serve the victims of vaccine injuries, their primary purpose and raison d’etre is to protect the vaccine program and vaccine makers. Damages are doled out from a 75-cent tax on every vaccine sold and not from the vaccine makers. “You can understand why special masters, burdened with their duty to protect vaccine programs, might be unwilling to make the direct causal link between autism and vaccines,” Krakow observed. “If you ask the big question and answer it in the affirmative, there is a sense that it will damage the vaccine program irreparably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine Court judges are equipped with a draconian armory of weapons deployable against plaintiffs intent on proving the causal connection between vaccines and autism. Jury trials are prohibited. Damages are capped; awards for pain and suffering are strictly limited and punitive damages banned altogether. Vaccine defenders have an army of Department of Justice attorneys with virtually unlimited resources for expert witnesses and other litigation costs. Plaintiffs, in contrast, must fund the up front costs for experts on their own. In a cultural choice that clearly favors defendants, vaccine court gives overwhelming weight to written medical records which are often inaccurate — over all other forms of testimony and evidence. Observations by parents and other caretakers are given little weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one question for David Kirby and RFK, Jr.: If the proceedings of the Vaccine Court are so rigged against the petitioners, why is it that the U.S. government pays their legal fees, win or lose? Readers may or may not have heard of a certain lawyer named &lt;a href="http://www.shoemakerassociates.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Clifford Shoemaker&lt;/a&gt;, who abused the subpoena process to punish Kathleen Seidel. What caused him to &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/150/"&gt;go after Kathleen Seidel with legal thuggery&lt;/a&gt;? What led him to take abusive retaliatory legal action was Seidel’s revelation of just &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/149/"&gt;how much money he had made from representing Vaccine Court petitioners&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the Vaccine Court goes beyond paying legal fees, even for those who lose. As Kathleen Seidel has &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/142/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;, the law guarantees payment of attorney’s fees and costs incurred by petitioners in presenting a claim to the Vaccine Court, as long as the claim is brought in good faith and the costs are deemed reasonable and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly odd to me is RFK, Jr.’s rant that the court gives overwhelming weight to written medical records. What on earth else is the court supposed to give the most weight to when considering medical-legal claims? Humans are very prone to confusing correlation with causation, as well as confirmation bias, and the tendency to subconsciously adjust memories to conform to beliefs. Medical records may indeed be fallible, but eyewitness testimony is even more fallible. Indeed, the Michelle Cedillo case shows that, given how the parents insisted that her neurological problems started after her vaccine. Videotapes made by her parents before she was vaccinated and before her neurologic symptoms manifested themselves to her parents showed that her abnormalities were pre-existing. Experts could see the early signs; her parents didn’t know what to look for and did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to cap off the advertisement in &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; and the tag team crankfest of David Kirby and RFK, Jr., Generation Rescue pulls out all the stops, trotting out–yes, you guessed it!–Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey. Check out this &lt;a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/29384043/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was heartbreaking to hear about Bailey’s story, but through this ruling we are gaining the proof we need to open the eyes of the world to the fact that vaccines do, in fact, cause autism,” said Jenny McCarthy, Hollywood actress, autism activist, best-selling author and Generation Rescue board member. “Bailey Banks’ regression into autism after vaccination is the same story I went through with my own son and the same story I have heard from thousands of mothers and fathers around the country. Our hope is that this ruling will influence decision and policy-makers to help the hundreds of thousands of children and families affected by this terrible condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiming in immediately after is her boyfriend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Carrey, Hollywood legend and Generation Rescue board member, reacted to the news, “It seems the U.S. government is sending mixed messages by telling the world that vaccines don’t cause autism, while, at the same time, they are quietly managing a separate ‘vaccine court’ that is ruling in favor of affected families and finding that vaccines, in fact, were the cause. For most of the autism community the question is no longer whether vaccines caused of their child’s autism. The question is why is their government only promoting the rulings that are in favor of the vaccine companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Jim, the question is why you and Jenny think your Google University education and personal anecdotal experience trumps science, epidemiology, and the accumulated knowledge based on mountains of epidemiological and scientific evidence, and why you think that a legal ruling on science decides science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, so much misinformation is there, especially in RFK, Jr.’s article, where he complains to high heaven about how plaintiffs’ attorneys supposedly can’t get access to the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Likely this is another one of RFK, Jr.’s exaggerations, but even if it weren’t, I’d have to wonder if, assuming the court may be indeed reluctant to give plaintiff’s attorneys access to the VSD, this reluctance has anything to do with concerns about the confidential medical information under HIPAA for the millions of medical records contained in that database. Or perhaps it is knowledge of how Mark and David Geier once tried to alter file extensions and merge datasets, very possibly to match names with cases. True, they denied it, but as &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/92/"&gt;Kathleen Seidel&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To justify their attempt to merge datasets, they refer to the absence of direct identifiers in patient records, apparently unaware or dismissive of the well-documented fact that aggregation of indirect identifiers (such as race, sex, birthweight, APGAR, maternal age, gestation, and date of vaccination) would compromise the confidentiality of private health information. Modern data mining software heightens the risk that patient confidentiality might be compromised by statistical researchers, hence the proliferation of guidelines for the conduct of such research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, legitimate researchers can get access to the VSD. Even lawyers for petitioners for the Vaccine Court &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php#comment-1432094"&gt;can get access&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, numerous studies have looked at the VSD data on vaccines, none finding any correlation between vaccines or thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. If the antivaccine movement had any scientists other than crank scientists, it could do studies using the VSD data too. All it takes is a protocol that can be approved by an IRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are  seeing here is desperation. The leadership of the antivaccine movement sees the writing on the wall. Study after study have failed to find even a whiff of a link between mercury and autism or vaccines and autism. The Vaccine Court, which, as the Banks case shows, is about as petitioner-friendly as can be, has recently conclusively ruled against the vaccine-autism hypothesis. The hero of the antivaccine movement has been revealed for the world to see as not just a dishonest man in the pay of lawyers suing vaccine manufacturers and hiding his conflict of interest, not just an incompetent scientist, but as an outright scientific fraud. They know that, in the reality-based world, the last nails are being driven into the coffin of the vaccine-autism hypothesis, which, zombie like, keeps pounding on the lid of the casket to try to loosen them and get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science does not support them; so all that is left is spin and P.R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll explain in a minute, but first you have to know why I even give a rodent's posterior about Harkin. As you may recall, no single legislator in the U.S. has done more to damage the cause of science- and evidence-based medicine than Tom Harkin. It was through his efforts that the National Institutes of Health, despite the fact that its scientists were not agitating for it, had the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NCCAM) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/nccam_your_tax_dollars_at_work.php"&gt;rammed down its throat&lt;/a&gt;, first as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) and then, when NIH Director Harold Varmus tried to place &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;OAM under more scientific NIH control&lt;/a&gt; in 1998, by elevating OAM to a full and independent Center within the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_national_center_for_complementary_an.php"&gt;complained many times&lt;/a&gt; about how NCCAM funds studies of pseudoscience and quackery and even more about how it promotes unscientific medical practices. I've said time and time again that there is nothing that is funded by NCCAM that wouldn't better be dealt with by other Centers or Institutes within the NIH. I've also pointed out Harkin and other CAM-friendly legislators created and promoted NCCAM not for the purpose of rigorous scientific evaluation of CAM practices, but rather to promote CAM and ultimately "integrate" it with scientific medicine. At this they have been enormously successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At "proving" that CAM works, not so much, so much so that Senator Tom Harkin is very, very unhappy with NCCAM and said so recently, as pointed out by &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2009/02/sen-harkin-national-center-for-alternative-medicine-disproves-too-much-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;Majikthise&lt;/a&gt;. On Thursday, Harkin told a Senate panel that he was disappointed that NCCAM had disproven too many alternative therapies. The video can be viewed &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Harkin's statements have also been &lt;a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c"&gt;posted to his Senate blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/maybe_nccam_isnt_so_bad_after_allnahhh.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/maybe_nccam_isnt_so_bad_after_allnahhh.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/0fON0xXzXmk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235972233769"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2383">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/871857f738c6b2a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="religion"/><category term="bigotry"/><category term="Glenn Beck"/><title type="html">Glenn Beck says I’m un-American.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/21018/"&gt;That is when Glenn Beck intends to take back the country . . . but from who?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The above time is taken from Beck’s website. Kinda has a Donnie Darko-kinda ring to it, doesn’t it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Anywho, he has 9 principles to answer who he wants to take the country back from. Oh, goody!!!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Below are nine simple principles. If you believe in at least seven of them, then we have something in common. I urge you to read the instructions at the end for how to help make your voice heard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nine Principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1. America is good.&lt;strong&gt; [you mean, all the time?]&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I believe in God and He is the Center of my Life. &lt;strong&gt; [which god?]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. I must always try to be a more honest person than I was yesterday.            &lt;strong&gt;[I guess Glenn fails that one]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The family is sacred. My spouse and I are the ultimate authority, not the government.             &lt;strong&gt;[I guess Glenn fails that one]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. If you break the law you pay the penalty. Justice is blind and no one is above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. I have a right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, but there is no guarantee of equal results.&lt;strong&gt; [Yup, true Americans support slavery]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. I work hard for what I have and I will share it with who I want to. Government cannot force me to be charitable. [&lt;strong&gt;No one can force Glenn to be charitable]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. It is not un-American for me to disagree with authority or to share my personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. The government works for me. I do not answer to them, they answer to me.            &lt;strong&gt;[Interesting theory. Now try refusing to pay your taxes and see what happens, Glenn]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Are Not Alone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;That’s right. You are not alone. But with Glenn as you’re company, you’ll wish you were.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese still have big plans for exploration, including a manned landing on the Moon. This was a small step for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that Emily says there are three extant orbiters around the Moon now that Chang’e 1 has ditched: Kaguya, a mini-orbiter released by Kaguya, and Chadrayaan-1. See anything interesting? Yeah, two are Japanese and the other Indian. Anything by the U.S.? Bueller? Bueller?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/28/launch-meat/"&gt;LRO launches in May&lt;/a&gt;, the first U.S. lunar probe in many years. I certainly hope it’s the first of a renaissance in lunar exploration… so that we can join the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

Health Minister Alan Johnson &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.2487305.0.chocolate_firms_are_urged_to_cut_bar_size.php"&gt;met with a coalition of confectionery giants&lt;/a&gt; including Mars, Coca-Cola and Nestle, urging them to reduce the sizes of their delicious, calorie-laden snacks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shrinking portions is not a new idea. Last year, Food Standards Agency formed a panel to &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/jun/portionsize"&gt;explore the role of food portion&lt;/a&gt; in our diets after announcing that reducing portions would be &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546891/Smaller-chocolate-bars-could-reduce-obesity.html"&gt;one of four key proposals&lt;/a&gt; for encouraging healthier eating in Britain. But someone else got the idea of reducing portions years before the FSA drew up their plan. The BBC News website devoted &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3693320.stm"&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; to the idea way back in 2004, after &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3692508.stm"&gt;confectionery giants announced&lt;/a&gt; that they would reduce the sizes of their delicious, calorie-laden snacks! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if the Food and Drink Federation agreed to cut the sizes of their snacks five years ago, how come Alan Johnson still pressing them to do so? The answer is in the alchemy of nutritional labelling and the science of psychology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/shrinking_snacks_how_junk_food.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/shrinking_snacks_how_junk_food.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235959148697"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1408">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1fa29b9d775bc303</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Special Education"/><category term="Teaching/Tutoring"/><category term="behaviour management"/><title type="html">Down a hall, noisily</title><published>2009-03-02T01:49:59Z</published><updated>2009-03-02T01:49:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/down-a-hall-noisily/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">It’s amazing just how much hallways comprise the problem-solving part of my day, compared to the actual amount of time I am in them, instead of the classroom.

&lt;p&gt;No, not by me, by your own party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republican party is now a &lt;a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/02/starry-eyed-look-at-2012-republican.html" title=""&gt;clown car&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sane, thoughtful conservatives have left it over the years, some prominent ones quite publicly last year, either more openly by stating they are leaving GOP, or a little more carefully, by endorsing Obama for President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is left are racist, sexist, homophobic, femiphobic, xenophobic, Creationist, authoritarian, theocratic, cowardly scuzbuckets like &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/rush-limbaughs-message-nation-libera" title=""&gt;Rush Limbaugh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/understanding_michele_bachmann.php" title=""&gt;Michele Bachmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/what-should-government-do-a-jindal-meditation/" title=""&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/search?q=sailer" title=""&gt;Steve Sailer&lt;/a&gt;, Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity, Anne Coulter and &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/18379" title=""&gt;Joe The Plumber&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the lowlife that came to Palin events to drool at her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the most insane Republicans in Congress. The sane ones lost their elections. None of them are left in the House.  A couple of them still in the Senate, but will have to switch to Independent if they want to get re-elected in their Blue states. The brand is THAT damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their platform? Make &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/03/01/america/socialism.php" title=""&gt;fun&lt;/a&gt; of everything that normal people &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/weekinreview/01connelly.html?_r=2&amp;amp;hp" title=""&gt;want&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/republicans_whos_that.php" title=""&gt;with that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are judged by who they are friends with. Do you want to be associated with those lunatics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why didn't you get the memo you were Expelled?  Because they are too high on endogenous hallucinogens. And they still hope to get your vote. One thing they have no interest in whatsoever are your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get together with other sane conservatives and try to wrestle the party from those cretins? Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get together with other sane conservatives and try to take over another party, e.g., Libertarians? Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get together with other sane conservatives and try to form another party? Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the above three scenarios will produce a party that is almost indistinguishable from the Democrats, who have firmly taken the Center. Tough to compete with a copycat against the Real McCoy. Anything even a little to the right of them is, right now, bordering on insane and totally unpopular because all those ideas have been tried over the past 40 years and each one of them failed miserably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the Democrats? As they are so corporate and straight in the middle, and unlikely, constitutionally (in the sense of their own mindset, not the highest law of the country), to ever move Left, that may be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just go Independent and watch as the US political ecosystem evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama has been the President for just a month. Give it a few more months and watch. It is quite possible that we are entering a very different &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/11/07/fourth_republic/index.html" title=""&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new world, we will have to forget the idea that there are two opposing parties keeping each other in check (even if one of them is full of shit on everything). In it, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php" title=""&gt;it will be us&lt;/a&gt; keeping check on our elected representatives. In such a world, parties and party affiliation will not be as important as they have been to date. It will take us some time to get used to the idea and to start using it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who get this new world will be relevant in it. Those who don't will be left behind. GOP will continue to be irrelevant as their &lt;em&gt;modus vivendi&lt;/em&gt; is the hating of Democrats and laughing at words they think are funny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSM will be irrelevant as they are still paying attention to what GOP-ers say (as if anyone cares), give them equal time (as if their opinions touch reality), or wonder how the Republicans will stage a come-back (as if this is some kind of inevitable Law Of Nature that this will ever happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you don't want to be laughed at, quit the GOP. You REALLY don't want to be associated with that amount of hate, idiocy and obstructionism, do you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/memo_to_self-described_sane_ra.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/a1_3ZFkZZ-Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235959027421"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/positive_emotions_and_psychoph.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/32da3a3921636090</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychology"/><title type="html">Positive Emotions and Psychophysiology</title><published>2009-03-01T22:48:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T22:48:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/WZnv0xRXrYw/positive_emotions_and_psychoph.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/positive_emotions_and_psychoph.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://sconc.org/" title=""&gt;SCONC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll explain in a minute, but first you have to know why I even care about what Harkin says or does, given that he’s not my Senator. As you may recall, arguably no single legislator in the U.S. has done more to harm to the cause of promoting science- and evidence-based medicine than Tom Harkin. That’s because it was primarily through Harkin’s efforts that the National Institutes of Health, despite the fact that its scientists were not agitating for it, had the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NCCAM) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/nccam_your_tax_dollars_at_work.php"&gt;rammed down its throat&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, first as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), then in 1998, when NIH Director Harold Varmus tried to place &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;OAM under more scientific NIH control&lt;/a&gt;, by elevating OAM to a full and independent Center within the NIH. Thus was NCCAM born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;complained many times&lt;/a&gt; about how NCCAM funds studies that, let’s face it, are of pseudoscience and quackery (homeopathy, anyone?) and even more about how it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=7"&gt;promotes unscientific medical practices&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve argued time and time again that there is no research that is funded by NCCAM that couldn’t be dealt with as well or better by other Centers or Institutes within the NIH. I’ve even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=342"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that NCCAM should be &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=345"&gt;defunded and dismantled&lt;/a&gt;, allowing CAM grant applications to be evaluated by the most appropriate center, as has our fearless leader &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=341"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. Most vociferous of all has been my fellow SBM blogger &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=349"&gt;Kimball Atwood&lt;/a&gt;, who has made &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=351"&gt;similar arguments&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=356"&gt;even greater length&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also pointed out Harkin and other CAM-friendly legislators created and managed to increase the funding of NCCAM to the tune of $120+ million a year not for the purpose of rigorous scientific evaluation of CAM practices, but rather to promote CAM and ultimately “integrate” it with scientific medicine. At this they have been enormously successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify. What I meant is that NCCAM, along with the Bravewell Collaborative, has been very successful in popularizing CAM in medical academia; at “proving” that CAM works, not so much. Evidence that this is so comes from a recent observation that Senator Tom Harkin is very, very unhappy with NCCAM these days and has publicly said so recently, as pointed out by &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2009/02/sen-harkin-national-center-for-alternative-medicine-disproves-too-much-alternative-medicine.html"&gt;Lindsay Beyerstein&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the &lt;a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2007/06/barry-l-beyerst.html"&gt;late, great skeptical psychologist Barry Beyerstein&lt;/a&gt;. On Thursday, Harkin told a Senate panel, &lt;a href="http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_02_26/2009_02_26.html"&gt;Integrative Care: A Pathway to a Healthier Nation&lt;/a&gt;, that he was disappointed that NCCAM had disproven too many alternative therapies. (His remarks begin about 17 minutes into the video on the webpage to which I linked.) In addition, Harkin’s statements have also been &lt;a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c"&gt;posted to his Senate blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased to co-chair this morning’s hearing with Senator Mikulski.  And I am eager to hear our distinguished witnesses’ ideas on using integrative care to keep people healthy, improve healthcare outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is fashionable, these days, to quote Abraham Lincoln.  So I would like to quote from his 1862 address to Congress - words that should inspire us as we craft health care reform legislation.  Lincoln said, “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty . . . .  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, the time has come to “think anew” and to “disenthrall ourselves” from the dogmas and biases that have made our current health care system - based overwhelmingly on conventional medicine - in so many ways wasteful and dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I note that on the video, Harkin does not say “conventional medicine.” In fact, he says “conventional &lt;em&gt;allopathic&lt;/em&gt; medicine.” And, as any regular reader of this blog knows, anyone who uses the term “allopathic” in such a contemptuous manner to describe conventional scientific medicine has clearly drunk the Kool Aid. But, consistent with how I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=369"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that CAM advocates would do their best to hijack any effort on the part of the Obama administration to reform the health care system by trying to link all manner of unscientific woo to “prevention,” Harkin goes on to do just that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to end the discrimination against alternative health care practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is time for America’s health care system to emphasize coordination and continuity of care, patient-centeredness, and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And it is time to adopt an integrative approach that takes advantage of the very best scientifically based medicines and therapies, whether conventional or alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is about giving people the pragmatic alternatives they want, while ending discrimination against practitioners of scientifically based alternative health care.  It is about improving health care outcomes.  And, yes, it is about reducing health care costs.   Generally speaking, alternative therapies are less expensive and less intrusive - and we need to take advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the false dichotomy. It is not necessary to embrace pseudoscience in order to reform the health care system to emphasize “coordination, continuity of care, and prevention.” Nor, I would argue, is it necessary to use placebo medicine as a coequal to scientific medicine in order to reduce costs (unless, of course, your goal is to reduce costs by not treating patients adequately), and, let’s face it, placebo medicine is what the vast majority of the hodge-podge of unscientific and pseudoscientific practices that fall under the rubric of CAM are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tellingly, Harkins makes the agenda of CAM advocates to hijack health care reform in order to get their foot in the door as “preventative” medicine as plain as can be, exactly as I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=369"&gt;described recently&lt;/a&gt;. Harkins first prefaces his remarks by explaining how he decided he wanted to write the legislation that brought into existence the OAM and, later, NCCAM. Not surprisingly, it was based on an anecdote about a friend of his from the House of Representatives who had a serious illness, tried “alternative” approaches, and supposedly got better. Then, Harkins makes a startling admission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note what Harkin first says here. He doesn’t say that the purpose of NCCAM was to investigate alternative approaches and determine if they work or not, regardless of what the results turned out to be. Rather, he states plainly that the purpose of NCCAM was to investigate and &lt;em&gt;validate&lt;/em&gt; alternative approaches. His concept for NCCAM is that it would prove that his favored woo works. That’s why he’s so disappointed that the vast majority of the studies coming out of NCCAM are actually negative. Moreover, he clearly doesn’t understand how science works. Hypothesis testing involves designing experiments or clinical trials that can be falsified; i.e., “disproved.” If an experiment or clinical trial can’t falsify the hypothesis that is being tested, then it is not really science. Falsification (attempting to disprove the hypothesis) is at the heart of how the scientific method works. But Tom Harkin does not want NCCAM to work by the scientific method. Not really. He has claimed that he does, but his statements above make it very clear that he only likes the scientific method when its results are what he wants them to be. Under NCCAM, many studies have been performed by believers under conditions quite favorable to producing apparently “positive results”; yet few and far between are any results resembling anything postive when it comes to NCCAM-funded studies, and they’re firtually nonexistent for studies funded by NCCAM for the major favored CAM modalities, such as “energy healing,” acupuncture, therapeutic touch. Only studies of herbs produce positive results, and such studies are nothing more than pharmacognosy, which could be done in virtually any Institute, depending upon what natural product is being studied. A special center for herbalism is not needed, and all the other CAM practices have, by and large, failed to stand up to even the favorable scrutiny of NCCAM-funded studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, now Senator Harkin is unhappy because NCCAM isn’t proving what he wants it to prove. So what’s his new strategy? Why, to “integrate” these therapies that have failed thus far to stand up to scientific scrutiny with scientific medicine! In fact, he makes it very clear that he plans on yoking any health care reform that President Obama tries to pass through the Congress to the addition of integrative medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1992 the field has evolved and matured.  Today, we are not just talking about alternative practices but also the integration between conventional and alternative therapies in order to achieve truly integrative health.  We need to have practitioners talking with each other, collaborating to treat the whole person.  And this is the model we intend to build into our health care reform bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On several occasions, I have laid down a public marker, saying that if we pass a bill that greatly extends health insurance coverage but does nothing to create a dramatically stronger prevention and public health infrastructure and agenda, then we will have failed the American people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this morning, I want to lay down a second marker:  If we fail to seize this unique opportunity to adopt a pragmatic, integrative approach to health care, then that, too, would constitute a serious failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, my dear readers, is what we are dealing with. A very powerful, senior Senator invites “luminaries” of the CAM movement to testify in front of his Senate committee and states openly that he will consider any health care reform that doesn’t include “integrative medicine” to be a failure. Funny, but as an advocate of science- and evidence-based medicine, I would consider a health care reform package that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; include the integration of unproven health care modalities, many of which are based on a pre-scientific understanding of illness, with science- and evidence-based medicine to be a catastrophic failure of health care reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage our readers, particularly the ones who are registered voters in Iowa, to comment on Senator Harkin’s statement using the &lt;a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/blog/?i=0b48b652-1947-405e-b4db-622f58d2a76c"&gt;link at the bottom of his blog entry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s a clean miss, but still pretty close. The rock, called 2009 DD45, was discovered only a few days ago — it’s small and faint, making it easy to miss. Closest approach is at 13:44 UT, and it happens over the Pacific. Hopefully lots of amateur astronomers will get images of it; it’ll be bright enough for awhile to catch. The problem is it’ll be moving really fast across the sky… well, fast meaning half a degree per minute, which in turn means getting images of it will be very tough; it’ll streak through a telescope’s field of view like a meteor at that rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll never see it naked eye; at magnitude 10 at brightest it’s a fraction as bright as what you can see with just your eye. It’s also too high up to be a danger to any satellites (space is big, so even one getting much closer is really unlikely to smack into something). Still, it’s pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll add that while news like this scares some people, it actually makes me feel somewhat better: we’re getting really good at finding these kinds of things.  Sure, if this rock had happened to be headed right for us we’d only have a few days warning before it hit (generating an enormous blast, as much as a high-yield nuclear weapon). But the thing is &lt;em&gt;we’re looking for and finding such rocks&lt;/em&gt;. That’s the first step; identifying potentially dangerous impactors. We’ve shown we can do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to do something about them. &lt;a href="http://www.b612foundation.org"&gt;Smart folks are working on it&lt;/a&gt;, and I bet in the next few years we’ll have a realistic and deployable plan on what action to take if we do see one drawing a bead on us.  Since the odds of getting hit at any given time are low, statistically speaking we still have time to figure this all out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t have forever. Let’s let 2009 DD45 be a reminder of that. We need to start doing something about these things, before we find one that really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; scary.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, "The card will inform police the carrier has autism and it is designed to take the stress out of them speaking to officers. The card will have the carrier's name and contact details of people who will be able to advise police on how best to respond to that person's needs."  A super short post &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-3565-Hartford-Parenting-Examiner~y2009m2d28-Autism-alert-identification-tags"&gt;Autism alert identification tags&lt;/a&gt; from Hartford (US) also talks about tags to assist with police interactions, for example "Sensitive to touch. Speak slowly. Use concrete terms. allow time for responses. May appear anxious, nervous, or upset for no apparent reason. See ID."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cards and IDs may help (I have both and wouldn't if I didn't think &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/disclosure_2_who_needs_to_know"&gt;such disclosure&lt;/a&gt; increased my safety in some way), but I worry that some key issues are not being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is whether someone is able, under pressure, to remember to use a communication card or show some form of identification.  I, personally, am not.  I have never once under pressure remembered to show my communication card.  It's always in the situations when I most need to communicate something that I am least able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is whether a person will be checked for an ID &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; dangerous or incorrect assumptions are made about that individual on the part of the police.  While theoretically first response officers are supposed to look for medical ID tags, they may not be able to even if they remember to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a concrete example, I was discussing the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_safety_and_danger_of_police_registries"&gt;police registry issue&lt;/a&gt; with someone involved in the more general ID/DD self-advocacy movement, and she told me about a friend of hers on the spectrum who is afraid of police officers because of some prior bad experiences.  He will literally run away from a police officer when he sees one.  This not only can cause the police officer to take actions that will further terrify the man and place him in additional danger, but it ensures that the officer won't be able to view an ID of any sort, including getting the man's name for a look up in a police registry, before taking an action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring safety is a systems issue; the problem does not reside in any single part of the system alone, so the solution likely won't either.&lt;/p&gt;

Said golfer Ernie Els about his son, Ben, who's on the autism spectrum, in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2009-02-27-2271174476_x.htm"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't help but feel for this kid, Ben..........He's a healthy kid and everything about him is perfect. He's just not going to be a, call it normal, kid one day. You're not going to play the same sport and he's not going to do the same things as you envisioned. That's the hard part."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our kids can do things that we've yet perhaps to envision----just one of the things about my own that makes him, yes, perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's hoping that Els, who's to compete in the Honda Classic in the upcoming week, will use his celebrity to promote this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of space, I went out last night with binoculars to take a peek at comet Lulin, but I could barely see it through a strip of thick cirrus spanning the sky right across the comet’s position. It’s cloudy again now, and the window of viewing opportunity on Lulin is narrowing: as the Moon waxes, it gets brighter, washing out the comet. Their positions on the sky are closing as well, so in about three days it’ll be over for casual comet watching for a week or so. So get out tonight if you can and take another look! &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/23/naked-eye-comet-graces-the-skies/"&gt;I have links to maps in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235949977444"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/purple-striped_jellies.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45dd8a1ead3f2be7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">Purple-striped jellies.</title><published>2009-03-01T20:42:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T20:42:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/gzcBT03fVRA/purple-striped_jellies.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/purple-striped_jellies.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;During our second day at the &lt;a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/"&gt;Monterey Bay Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; last weekend, I finally got my much needed jelly time.  I also had occasion to notice that their jelly exhibits have shrunk significantly since their height a few years ago, and that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/12/spotted_jellies.php"&gt;some of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/09/mediterranean_jellies.php"&gt;my favorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/12/hungry_flowers.php"&gt;varieties&lt;/a&gt; are no longer on display.  Booo!  MOAR JELLEES PLEEZ!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahem.  Where was I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there are still some pleasing jellies on display.  One of these is the &lt;a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx?enc=n3f4wmcSJaNx01oyfCKuWA=="&gt;purple-striped jelly&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Chrysaora colorata&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

This includes two BPR3-icon-worthy posts about science! The first was on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/circadian_rhythm_of_aggression.php" title=""&gt;Circadian Rhythm of Aggression in Crayfish&lt;/a&gt; with the longish addendum on citing blog posts in scientific literature. The second was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/an_awesome_whale_tale.php" title=""&gt;An Awesome Whale Tale&lt;/a&gt;, and, related to this paper, I announced the new Palaeontology Collection in PLoS ONE in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/fossils_fossils_fossils.php" title=""&gt;Fossils! Fossils! Fossils!&lt;/a&gt;. I also did an &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/interview_with_dradam_ratner.php" title=""&gt;interview with Dr.Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have covered another session in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_315.php" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09 - Saturday 3:15pm - Blog carnivals&lt;/a&gt;. Miss Baker and her students were &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/miss_baker_and_students_on_npr.php" title=""&gt;on NPR&lt;/a&gt; and one of the students wrote a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_malaria_song.php" title=""&gt;Malaria Song&lt;/a&gt; that spread virally across the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave an hour-long radio interview about ScienceOnline'09, science blogging and science journalism, and you can &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/this_morning_on_the_radio_-_po.php" title=""&gt;listen to the podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Zimmer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/darwin_day_with_carl_zimmer_-.php" title=""&gt;was in town&lt;/a&gt; for Darwin Day so we had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/darwin_day_recap.php" title=""&gt;great fun at his talk and after&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the Media roll again, starting with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/dc_press_core_dissed_again_-_b.php" title=""&gt;D.C. press corps dissed again - but this time for good reasons&lt;/a&gt;, continuing with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/a_quick_note_to_huffington_pos.php" title=""&gt;A Quick Note to Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/incendiary_weekend_post_on_blo.php" title=""&gt;Incendiary weekend post on bloggers vs. journalists&lt;/a&gt;, then noted that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_carrboro_citizen_wins_six.php" title=""&gt;Carrboro Citizen won six NC press awards&lt;/a&gt;, and ending with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php" title=""&gt;Why good science journalists are rare?&lt;/a&gt; and two linkfests of good related stuff: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/a_smorgasbord.php" title=""&gt;A smorgasbord....&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/on_the_media_-_your_weekend_re.php" title=""&gt;On the Media - your weekend reading (instead of the hardcopy NYT you are not subscribed to anyway)&lt;/a&gt; (plus several more link and copy+paste posts on the topic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On blogging and social media, there were, as usual, several posts. First, I asked &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/do_you_comment_on_your_own_blo.php" title=""&gt;Do you comment on your own blog?&lt;/a&gt;. Then, relating it to politics, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php" title=""&gt;Who has power?&lt;/a&gt;. Then I traced &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_evolution_of_facebook.php" title=""&gt;The Evolution of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, announced the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/join_the_north_carolina_group.php" title=""&gt;North Carolina group on Nature Network&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the analysis of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/user_activity_on_plos_one_-_an.php" title=""&gt;User activity on PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, announced an amazing inaugural &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/diversity_in_science_carnival.php" title=""&gt;Diversity in Science Carnival&lt;/a&gt; and noted a two-fer from the Nature Publishing group on the same day: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_its_good_to_blog.php" title=""&gt;Nature: It's good to blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_methods_its_good_to_blo.php" title=""&gt;Nature Methods: It's good to blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also listed several meetings I'd like to go to: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart.php" title=""&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart_1.php" title=""&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart_2.php" title=""&gt;Part III&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart_3.php" title=""&gt;Part IV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart_4.php" title=""&gt;Part V&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart_5.php" title=""&gt;Part VI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to NYC and participated in a panel &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/quick_check-in_from_nyc.php" title=""&gt;on Open Science&lt;/a&gt;, then had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/google-bombing_curmudgeons_one.php" title=""&gt;coffee with Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, lunch with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_ars_of_lunch.php" title=""&gt;John Timmer&lt;/a&gt;, dinner with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/last_night_in_nyc.php" title=""&gt;a bunch of bloggers&lt;/a&gt; and another dinner in a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_one_and_onnly_serbian_rest.php" title=""&gt;Serbian restaurant&lt;/a&gt; before coming &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/home_2.php" title=""&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I'll be in Boston, so if you are there, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/in_boston_are_you.php" title=""&gt;meet me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_best_of_february.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/dek2nJG6M9A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235943505213"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/you_want_to_put_what_in_my_wha.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed64810fd4ae905a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">You want to put WHAT in my what??!?</title><published>2009-03-01T20:56:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T20:56:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/HhIyM5UXb2Y/you_want_to_put_what_in_my_wha.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/you_want_to_put_what_in_my_wha.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the phallus of a beetle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early last year &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/25/basteroid/"&gt;I announced&lt;/a&gt; that my friend Jeff Medkeff had named an asteroid after me (as well others named after PZ Myers, Rebecca Watson, and Michael Stackpole). 165347 philplait is a smallish rock about 1.3 kilometers across, just shy of a mile. It orbits the Sun in the main asteroid belt, on average — the orbit is a mild ellipse — about 350 million kilometers from the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was thinking it would be fun to see if anyone could nab cool images of the rock. However, its size and distance make it very faint, so it was a bit of a difficult target. Worse, its position in the sky at that time put it too close to the Sun to see for long. So I basically put it on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, eventually the viewing geometry got better, and so few days ago amateur astronomer and BABloggee Rick Johnson &lt;a href="http://www.bautforum.com/astrophotography/85413-phil-plaits-bad-asteroid.html"&gt;decided to go for it&lt;/a&gt;. Despite clouds (and later, snow!) he was able to take several images of 165347 philplait, which he combined to make &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3316978397/"&gt;this totally cool movie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;



&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v%3D67090&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=267&amp;amp;flashVars=intl_lang%3Den-us%26photo_secret%3Dc3f1c72acc%26photo_id%3D3316978397" width="400" height="267"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, Rick says, he can make animations like this for pretty faint objects, but the clouds made this one difficult. He had to do some post-processing to make it viewable; that’s why the stars look like round disks but the asteroid is just a couple of dots (normally, the asteroid would look the same size as the stars). Still, how cool is this? If he can do that under pretty poor  observing conditions, what can be done when the weather is clear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up the asteroid’s orbit using &lt;a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=165347&amp;amp;orb=1"&gt;the JPL Small Bodies Browser&lt;/a&gt;, and saw that 165347 philplait reaches opposition around March 15, in just a couple of weeks. That means it’s up all night, giving plenty of time to observe it, and it’s closest to Earth, making it as bright as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m giving a call out to any amateurs out there: I’d love to see more images and even animations of &amp;quot;my&amp;quot; asteroid! If you have the right equipment — a 12″ ’scope with a good CCD should be sufficient to get images of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; magnitude rock — then give it a shot. If you get good images (or animations) put them up on &lt;a href="http://www.bautforum.com/astrophotography/"&gt;the Bad Astronomy/Universe Today forum&lt;/a&gt;, or Flickr, or wherever, and send me a link. I’ll collect them and post the images here, too. And if you can get images of the other asteroids that’s fine too, we can get PZ, Rebecca, and Stackpole in on the fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy rock hunting!

He seems angry. There just might be stages that formerly brainwashed believers go through who leave the fold, and the first stage is anger. I myself didn't experience that stage, and I still have no anger after learning &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/best-antidote-to-brainwashing-demanding.html"&gt;I was brainwashed into believing&lt;/a&gt;. After all, I was brainwashed by the brainwashed and I in turn brainwashed others.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dane writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We love to mock Christian evangelicals. If you complain about this blog's contents being offensive after just reading the above text you're only proving two things about yourself. And these are that you're a hypocrite and that you are an idiot!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some of the purposes of his blog are:&lt;blockquote&gt;To point out the hypocrisy of far right fundamentalists.&lt;br&gt;To mock Christian fundamentalism.&lt;br&gt;To offer evidence that Christian evangelical fundamentalism is actually a mental illness and delusional thinking.&lt;br&gt;To report on the latest moral failures of Christian fundamentalist preachers through providing the links to and commenting about the news articles and videos catching these hypocrites in action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And in one of his posts he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; I openly mock you Christian fundamentalists! I piss on the name of your God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Don't get me wrong, as I've written previously, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/03/are-we-angry-atheists.html"&gt;I understand Dane's anger&lt;/a&gt;, much like there was an understandable African-American rage once blacks began gaining their needed rights in American society, it's just that I wish angry atheists would first calm down before they write much. It plays into the stereotypical view believers have of atheists, and it's not healthy if sustained for a long period of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time some anger seems justified. Psychologist Dr. Valerie Tarico has written an excellent piece describing the phenomenon of &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/01/atheist-arrogance.html"&gt;Atheist Arrogance&lt;/a&gt; which equally applies I think to “Angry Atheists.” I wish everyone would read what she wrote. It explains so much of what is underneath the stereotype.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

As Ben Goldacre &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/the-evidence-aric-sigman-ignored"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; on badscience.net:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Professor Susan Greenfield is the head of the &lt;a href="http://www.rigb.org/"&gt;Royal Institution&lt;/a&gt; and the person behind the Daily Mail headline "&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1153583/oh-please-no-more-of-this-ricockulousness.html"&gt;Social websites harm children’s brains&lt;/a&gt;: Chilling warning to parents from top neuroscientist”, which has spread &lt;a href="http://news.google.co.uk/news?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;%20rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tab=wn&amp;amp;ncl=1307456451"&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/young-minds-in-hitech-turmoil-426326.html"&gt;like the last time&lt;/a&gt; she said it, and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/mobile/bbc_news/haveyoursay/5/523/forum5235.shtml"&gt;the time before that&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It is my view that Professor Greenfield has been abusing her position as a professor, and head of the Royal Institution, for many years now, using these roles to give weight to her speculations and prejudices in a way that is entirely inappropriate. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We are all free to have fanciful ideas. Professor Greenfield’s stated aim, however, is to improve the public’s understanding of science: and yet repeatedly she appears in the media making wild headline-grabbing claims, without evidence, all the while telling us repeatedly that she is a &lt;em&gt;scientist&lt;/em&gt;. By doing this, the head of the RI grossly misrepresents what it is that scientists do, and indeed the whole notion of what it means to have empirical evidence for a claim. It makes me quite sad, when the public’s understanding of science is in such a terrible state, that this is one of our most prominent and well funded champions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This example also shows that transnational flows of foolishness do sometimes surge westward across the Atlantic, since Prof. Greenfield's warnings were picked up by several major U.S. media outlets, including &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/25/earlyshow/health/main4827591.shtml"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/02/25/oxford-scientist-facebook-might-ruin-minds/"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-talk-brainfeb25,0,2615704.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;, one of the NYT's blogs (Robert Mackey, "&lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/the-health-effects-of-social-networking/"&gt;The Health Effects of Social Networking&lt;/a&gt;", 2/24/2009), one of the SF Chronicle's blogs (Amy Graff, "&lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfmoms/detail?&amp;amp;entry_id=36231"&gt;Will Facebook turn our kids into social cowards?&lt;/a&gt;", 2/25/2009), and prompted a common-sense debunking  by Sarah Lacy in the Washington Post ("&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/0/24/AR2009022401706.html"&gt;Why Social Networks are Good for the Kids&lt;/a&gt;", 2/24/2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can listen to Prof. Greenfield's own words in an interview with the Guardian &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/audio/2009/feb/25/greenfield-facebook"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts is near the start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We actually know now that the environment can actually influence&lt;br&gt;
uh the connections between your brain cells,&lt;br&gt;
so that as you have individual experiences, the brilliant thing about&lt;br&gt;
being born&lt;br&gt;
a human being&lt;br&gt;
is that you have um individual brain cell connections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She neglects to mention that this is also the brilliant thing about being born a dog, or an octopus, or for that matter (I think) a worm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second favorite part comes towards the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This is the first time — the &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; first time –&lt;br&gt;
that grown up adults — human beings –&lt;br&gt;
have spent their precious money and leisure time&lt;br&gt;
playing games all on their own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s technically true that reading novels is not a game — but isn&amp;#39;t it a more solitary form of activity than Facebook and the like are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my understanding is that autism (at least the type that used to be called "early infantile autism") generally appears within the first few years of life, well before Facebook comes into the picture for most children. That's one reason that some people became convinced of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy"&gt;connection to the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, since the age at which that type of autism appears (or at least is diagnosed) is often about the same time that the vaccine is usually given, roughly between 1 and 5. In any case, the major increase in the number of reported cases of autism was in the  1990s and early 2000s, or even before that — Facebook was founded in 2004. (Some portions of Prof. Greenfield&amp;#39;s remarks seem to refer to gaming rather than to social networking sites — the target of her warnings is not very crisply delineated — and thus there would be a better case for concerns about computer games in this connection, if only there were any reason to think that very many 2-year-olds had been playing them much over the past 20 years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in addition to the lack of any concrete evidence to support Prof. Greenfield's warnings, there seems to be a good &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; case that the suggested connection between social networking sites and increased autism is intrinsically implausible. Similar things could be said about the suggested connection to ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do we get parents to lighten up? After talking with Dr. Stuart Brown, I am convinced that we are sucking not only all the danger out of play, but all the learning and creativity out of it, but insisting that structured and supervised activities are the only marks of quality- when sometimes, kids learn more from free play and goofing around than from any adult structured project. As much as we’re all scared to death of what could happen, (pedophiles, broken bones, name your horror here) &lt;strong&gt;most of this stuff is incredibly rare&lt;/strong&gt;, and in the name of helicopter parent-like safety, we may actually be depriving our kids from learning the skills they need to be independent adults. And if they don’t get safe practice as kids, they will be woefully underprepared for the real world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235931842505"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/movie_star_for_a_day.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0d1191f4d57251f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Local"/><title type="html">Movie star for a day</title><published>2009-03-01T15:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T15:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/DQkPhxM-9HQ/movie_star_for_a_day.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/movie_star_for_a_day.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last time I was interviewed on location here in Morris was the fateful day that I was taped for a little movie that became &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;…and we know how that turned out. It&amp;#39;s happening again, only this time it&amp;#39;s not some secretive intelligent design proponent coming in on false pretenses: it&amp;#39;s Josh Timonen of the Richard Dawkins Foundation stopping by.

&lt;p&gt;It takes some dedication to do this. We&amp;#39;re a long 3 hour drive from the nearest airport, reached by way of a notorious series of speed-traps, it&amp;#39;s -10°F, snow is piled high in deep drifts all around, and once you get here, well, you&amp;#39;re in the tiny town of &lt;i&gt;Morris&lt;/i&gt;.

If I were not hip to 80's posterkid and converted "atheist", Kirk Cameron and his NAMBLA-looking, banana-loving Master, Ray Comfort, I'd think that &lt;a href="http://www.pulltheplugonatheism.com/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; were a tremendous &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Poe%27s+Law%60"&gt;Poe&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, take a look at this little video - a preview from the new season of &lt;i&gt;Way of the Master&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/UbDd2erbVJM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can always count on Ray Comfort to push the dumbest possible "argument" on people and then claim victory.  See, Ray has to do the ambush technique because he knows most people don't spend much, if any, time thinking about religion or retarded questions like, &lt;i&gt;"How do you make honey from nothing?"&lt;/i&gt;.  He knows he can catch people off guard and that's when he makes them look silly for not having a coherent answer for his nonsensical, drug-addled homeless person, unquestions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you make milk from nothing?  The correct answer is, &lt;i&gt;"What's your real question, asshole?"&lt;/i&gt;  He would then have to revert to something like, &lt;i&gt;"Why is there something instead of nothing?"&lt;/i&gt;, or, &lt;i&gt;"Do you believe that there is an Intelligent Designer who made the universe and everything in it?"&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least that would stop him from wasting your time.  Then you could say, &lt;i&gt;"No.  I don't.  Go blow Kirk."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 2:23 of the video below (it's painful, so maybe just let it load and skip ahead), Kirk says that he, "knows there's a God" because he's living, he's breathing, and he's standing here.  Brings back the ol' &lt;i&gt;"I know there's a God because, well, just look at that pretty sunset."&lt;/i&gt; It's about as childish as pooping in your pants, only a bit harder to clean up after. &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RKnxhrnHGew%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Ray, at about the 3:00 mark says that atheists "hate God".  *sigh*  Such stupidity is hardly worth countering because it's like explaining that hating Lenny the Flaming Sabre-Tooth Apple Fairy doesn't make sense.  You can't hate Lenny, Ray.  Sadly, Kirk-n-Ray can't see the how ridiculous these videos make them look and that their sites are most popular among atheists because of the tremendous amount of humour we get from watching them flounder about in their wet-toilet-paper-deep philosophy.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

I’ve seen the red ball trick described in the article, and it really is cool.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[I] &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;wrote about a coordinated attack&lt;/a&gt; by the antivaccine movement on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;Autism Omnibus decision&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago. Given that it involved Generation Rescue, Jim Carrey, Jenny McCarthy, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Deirdre Imus and her Deirdre Imus Environmental Center for Pediatric Oncology, the Huffington Post, Age of Autism, and various other antivaccine activists, I thought it pretty obvious that there was a lot of planning and coordination of effort. However, I never expected to find the sort of planning and coordination of effort discovered by Kevin Leitch. It turns out that David Kirby and Peter Bell of &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1921"&gt;coordinating their efforts&lt;/a&gt; to drum up &amp;quot;respectability&amp;quot; to the idea that vaccines cause autism.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin discovered this when David Kirby posted an e-mail to his &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evidence of Harm&lt;/a&gt; Yahoo! group. This e-mail happened to include an exchange between him and Peter Bell that led to Kirby writing his &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/nih-agency-head-vaccine-a_b_170034.html"&gt;latest HuffPo spinfest&lt;/a&gt; based on an &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science_news/nichd_alexander_interview.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Autism Speaks interview&lt;/a&gt; with Duane Alexander, M.D., Director of the NICHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most telling is this exchange, after Bell had forwarded this interview to Kirby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell:&lt;/strong&gt; You just happened to find this on our website, right? J


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby:&lt;/strong&gt; I go there often, yes! The piece will be up in minutes NICE JOB!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So let me give a shout-out to Matt Springer at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/"&gt;Built on Facts&lt;/a&gt;, who had the brilliant idea of discussing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/sunday_function/"&gt;a different function every Sunday&lt;/a&gt;.  Functions are one of those things that are as necessary to math and science as breathing, but which don’t necessarily percolate into the wider world.  And he (quite correctly, I think) interprets his self-imposed mandate fairly liberally, taking the time to talk about various issues in middle-level mathematics.  Here are some selections from Matt’s series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/12/sunday_function_16.php"&gt;Exponential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/11/sunday_function_12.php"&gt;Arctangent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/10/sunday_function_9.php"&gt;Witch of Agnesi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/11/sunday_function_13.php"&gt;Stirling’s approximation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2008/09/sunday_function_6.php"&gt;Continuous but almost-nowhere differentiable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, 28 February, p. A20) and paused a moment: why was this name so familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, later in the obit, came&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jorden's first marriage, to Eleanor Harz, a professor of Japanese at Cornell University and elsewhere, ended in divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! Eleanor Harz Jorden, author of the very influential textbooks &lt;em&gt;Reading Japanese&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Japanese: The Spoken Language&lt;/em&gt; (and a member of the Linguistic Society of America). And there she was in a photo (with her husband and son) from 1956.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it turns out that she too died recently, on 11 February (William J. Jorden died on 20 February). A brief obituary (&lt;a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Feb09/JordenObit.html"&gt;reprinted&lt;/a&gt; from the Cornell Chronicle), citing her as "a linguist and world leader in language pedagogy and language teacher training", &lt;a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/20/20-623.html"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; yesterday on the Linguist List.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235921088202"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4383359275276698275">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0070aa85d5a6f15c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">When Atheism Is the Norm</title><published>2009-03-01T15:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T15:19:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/when-atheism-is-norm.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4383359275276698275/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4383359275276698275" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The Friendly Atheist has posted an interesting comment on what&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like to live in Denmark or Sweden [What Happens When Atheism is the Norm Instead of the Exception?].His comments are based on a recent article in The New York Times that discussed that topic [Scandanavian Nonbelievers, Which Is Not to Say Atheists].Anyone who has paid attention knows that Denmark and Sweden are among the least</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235920141942"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-2130224209509607322">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4a1cb24355c100ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humour" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">My favourite PhD comics.</title><published>2009-03-01T12:33:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T12:58:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/ii3UokxZQAk/my-favourite-phd-comics.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=2130224209509607322" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-favourite-phd-comics.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Stephen Jay Gould once noted that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Far_Side"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Far Side&lt;/span&gt; by Gary Larson&lt;/a&gt; adorns more scientists' office doors than any other series of cartoons.

The dedicated faculty and dynamic curriculum produce graduates of excellent clinical skill with a strong sense of service. Initially I was too focused on coursework to pay much mind to the student-run interest group in “cross-cultural and integrative medicine” and the occasional extracurricular CAM event. More recently, however, I noticed that such events had become a highly-publicized, monthly occurrence. It was still very much outside the official curriculum, but the discussion was one-sided with no public debate.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;In addition to the student group on my local campus, we have a “CAM institute” that boosts CAM across the wider university. The CAM institute is a major sponsor of events organized by the student group in addition to producing its own lecture series and publications. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;The events hosted by either group are of two types. The first kind is an activity for med students that essentially functions as stress management: a yoga instructor leads free sessions between lectures once a week, and free herbal tea or massages are offered during final exam week. Who can complain about that? The massages are quite popular.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;The second kind of event is a lecture or workshop on a particular CAM modality.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Topics have included acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy, and Reiki. The lecturer is a practitioner of the modality in question, sometimes an MD who “integrates” the CAM into standard practice. These lectures are publicized more widely than any type of event on campus, with color posters littering the hallways from the parking deck to the hospital cafeteria. As a rule I avoid the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;“hands-on” workshops with, for example, Reiki masters and craniosacral manipulators, but I have attended several lectures first out of curiosity but increasingly in frustration at the lack critical analysis. After the &lt;em&gt;second &lt;/em&gt;time I listened to a visiting MD promote homeopathy, I was moved to publish a critique in our student newspaper and finally start a public debate. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Campus-wide emails and posters announced for weeks the upcoming guest lecture by Dr. Larry Baskind, pediatrician and instructor for &lt;font color="#000000"&gt;the &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cedhusa.org/"&gt;Center for the Education and Development of Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;. The title of the lecture was “Clinical Homeopathy in Medicine” and the advertisements said: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;“Dr. Baskind will discuss basic principles of homeopathy, review cases from his practice, and suggest some useful homeopathic and herbal medicines for the upcoming cold and flu season. … Dr. Baskind has found that homeopathic (and herbal) medicines can be very effective treatments for a variety of complaints that a busy pediatrician sees in practice on a daily basis.  When knowledgeably prescribed, these medicines are inexpensive, safe to take, and beneficial to patients.”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Searching Google for Dr. Baskind, I found a &lt;a href="http://www.boironusahcp.com/tools_resources/kol_larry_baskind.aspx"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;of him recommending Oscillococcinum, a homeopathic flu remedy derived from &lt;a href="http://www.homeowatch.org/history/oscillo.html"&gt;duck liver&lt;/a&gt; (insert quackery pun here),&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt; on the website of its manufacturer. In the promotional video, he describes Oscillococcinum as a safe, easy, over-the-counter way for parents to treat children at the first sign of flu. The viewer may be heartened to hear him stress the importance of flu vaccine and of medical treatment for flu complications. Immediately following that advice, however, he asserts (emphasis mine): “What I find &lt;strong&gt;most impressive &lt;/strong&gt;is that Oscillococcinum has been available for 65 years. … 14 million people around the world treat themselves with Oscillococcinum for the flu.” Apparently less impressive than the marketing numbers are the data he references at the end of the video, which are not accessible on PubMed and were criticized for “suspiciously round numbers” by the &lt;a href="http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD001957/frame.html"&gt;Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt;. Appeals to age and popularity rather than decent data while glossing over the fundamental implausibility of homeopathy was a good preview of Dr. Baskind’s lecture.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;The talk took place in the largest hall of the medical school, which to my dismay was filled rather more than it was for most course lectures. Hopefully, I told myself, the high attendance was due to the impressive spread of wraps and salads. (Most extracurricular lectures necessarily use pizza or subs to entice busy med students, and the CAM events can be often counted on for a free lunch of exceptional quality.) If AMSA thinks I should be “&lt;a href="http://www.pharmfree.org/"&gt;Pharm-free&lt;/a&gt;“, I thought, then I will be “CAM-free” to stay impartial, so I brought my own food.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;The speaker was comfortable and charming before the audience. He assured us that he always follows evidence-based medicine (EBM) when possible, praising vaccines and antibiotics as proof of this commitment. However, he finds that EBM has nothing to offer for many common complaints brought by his patients, such as viral infections, and he feels compelled to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore he looks to homeopathy to pick up the slack when EBM fails. He showed with a chart how often in a given month, according to a review of his patient records, he has no EBM recommendation for a patient’s chief complaint. (These frequencies of EBM failure were the only data presented during the hour.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Dr. Baskind freely acknowledged, with a knowing grin, that the 200-year-old theory behind homeopathy strains credulity. He then explained all about similars and &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Arial"&gt;infinitesimals &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;anyway, without suggesting any more plausible mechanism. Pointing out the problem with Avogardro’s number he all but admitted that there is no trace of the original ingredient, and yet he still claimed that the &lt;em&gt;particular &lt;/em&gt;pill he selects for a &lt;em&gt;particular &lt;/em&gt;symptom has a &lt;em&gt;specific &lt;/em&gt;effect that is clinically significant. Sprinkled through his description of which remedies address which symptoms were anecdotes about happy patients.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;From my article in the student newspaper:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Why does Baskind believe in homeopathy? He expresses incredulity that &lt;em&gt;so many &lt;/em&gt;people could believe in it for &lt;em&gt;so long &lt;/em&gt;if it were not effective, but the “old and popular” practices of bloodletting, racism, and astrology suggest that mass delusion is certainly plausible. He is comforted because FDA regulates the manufacture of homeopathic products, but of course “not contaminated with melamine” is a far cry from “proven safe and efficacious by Phase III clinic trials.” He puts great faith in reports of patients whose symptoms improve after taking homeopathic drugs, but the &lt;em&gt;primary rationale &lt;/em&gt;for using EBM is that such &lt;em&gt;uncontrolled observations &lt;/em&gt;cannot distinguish correlation from causation. His anecdotes are rife with possible confounding effects, such as regression to the mean or concomitant EBM therapy, so how can we know? &lt;em&gt;Randomized controlled trials &lt;/em&gt;(RCTs) are the appropriate way to evaluate such complex interventions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Homeopaths often deny the power of RCTs to analyze homeopathy because homeopathy’s mechanism is mysterious. The history of scientific medicine belies this excuse. Although the value of hygiene, for example, met resistance from physicians who relied on tradition and personal experience, incontrovertible data won the day even before the germ theory of infectious diseases was available to explain them. Similarly, the famous trial showing that lemons cure scurvy saved many lives before ascorbic acid and lysyl hydroxylase were identified.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt; Baskind’s claim that RCTs are ineffective because different people respond differently to homeopathy is odd because this is true for many drugs, perhaps through genetic variation in target receptors or liver enzymes. Rather, RCTs are the &lt;em&gt;solution &lt;/em&gt;to this problem; carefully controlled studies allow us to identify which groups respond best to which interventions &lt;em&gt;even if we do not understand why &lt;/em&gt;(e.g., particular hypertension drugs for African Americans). If his “chronic reactional modes” have validity, then Baskind can assign subjects into appropriate groups and thereby &lt;em&gt;increase &lt;/em&gt;the power of a homeopathy study.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"&gt;Homeopathy should not be adopted into modern medicine until it meets the same standards of science-based care as other disciplines. Baskind neither showed nor referenced data for the specific efficacy of homeopathy, probably because only low-quality trials show positive effects. Given the implausible tenets of this pre-scientific philosophy, “placebo” is the null hypothesis and the burden of proof is on homeopaths. I celebrate the ICAM call for research into old and popular treatments, but such drugs should not be used on patients &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;good research shows them efficacious.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the talk ended, I raised my hand to ask my question, carefully prepared in advance to challenge without sounding presumptuous or rude. (Please remember: I am a medical student confronting a lecturing physician in a packed hall.) I asked, “How do you respond to physicians who believe the effects of homeopathy are explained by placebo?” He dismissed such physicians as obviously having never tried homeopathy before. I have noticed this theme previously in CAM apologists, effectively “you can’t knock it until you’ve tried it.” Does experiencing a possible placebo effect firsthand make a human being &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;objective about it? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke up again, with less grace this time since I was not prepared for his response, saying that surely we physicians and students do not &lt;em&gt;each &lt;/em&gt;need to try &lt;em&gt;every &lt;/em&gt;drug or intervention personally; rather we rely on collective wisdom in the form of evidence-based guidelines. Baskind responded with a story about a woman with unexplained symptoms that improved after homeopathic treatment. It seems his primary reason for using homeopathy is not “we have good evidence (or theory) that it works” but rather “we’d hate to send patients home empty handed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My article earned me words of thanks from a few students, those skeptical but too busy to care much. One grumbled “someone had to say it.” Only secondhand did I hear about classmates who were unhappy about the article, though no one responded to my arguments in person or in public. In fact, one particularly friendly leader of the integrative medicine group thanked me for being respectful in my disagreement and invited me to attend an upcoming presentation by a naturopath! More on that to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my article I found a sympathetic professor and some likeminded students who want to invite a skeptical physician to speak on campus, either as a counterbalance to the deluge of CAM speakers or to participate in an organized debate. Any interest from SBM writers or readers in the NYC area?&lt;/p&gt;

His link actually points to a BBC News story whose headline now reads "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/7909510.stm"&gt;Peer jailed for motorway texting&lt;/a&gt;". All the same, Fev's larger point seems to be exactly right: "American hed dialect just doesn't do this".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A quick search on Lexis Nexis turn up a Daily Mail story from 12/2/2008 with the headline "M1 death crash peer is banned". And a search on the BBC News website turns up a story about "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7578010.stm"&gt;Safari death crash Britons&lt;/a&gt;", and another about "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lincolnshire/7846801.stm"&gt;Family death crash father&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the jounalistic dialect difference is not just the general taste for big noun-compound pile-ups suggested by Geoff Pullum's recent post on the "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1121"&gt;Dentist fear girl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; — the simple two-noun phrase &amp;quot;death crash&amp;quot; seems to be strongly biased towards British Commonwealth sources. A Lexis Nexis search for &amp;quot;death crash&amp;quot; in the headlines of &lt;em&gt;Major U.S. and World Publications&lt;/em&gt;, for a time span of the past two years, gets 798 hits, not a single one of  which is in a U.S. paper. Most of the sources are British, from The Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail to the Guardian and the Times; but there's also the Belfast Telegraph, the South China Morning Post, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Christchurch (NZ) Press, the Toronto Sun, the Irish Times,  the Sunday Times (of South Africa), and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently L-N doesn't index the BBC News site, but a "death crash" search there gets 151 hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, searching the Times of India, the Nation (Pakistan), and the Daily Star (Bangladesh) failed to turn up anything. I didn't try English-language papers from former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to the U.K., "death crash" in headlines is often used to modify a following noun, such as &lt;em&gt;beers, bike, biker, bride, brothers, boy, bus, car, charges, constable, cops, cyclist, dad, damages, driver, fireman, footballer, garda, goalkeeper, hubby, jet, joyrider, man, mother, motorbike, motorcyclist, mum, nurse, PC, peer, pilot, probe, schoolgirls, sisters, soldier, squaddie, survivors, teenagers, tourist, trio, trucker, vehicle, verdict, victims, witness, woman, youth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combinations with following noun pairs are also fairly common: &lt;em&gt;death crash speed camera, death crash traffic chaos, death crash lap dancer, death crash text woman, death crash RAF pilot, death crash coach driver, … , miracle girl, soccer star, drink driver, lorry driver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less common for "death crash" to be pre-modified: &lt;em&gt;girl death crash, Diana death crash, tunnel death crash&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifications both fore and aft are even less common, but do occur. In addition to those cited above, I found one five-element compound: "Army air death crash probe".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American headline phrase for high-kinetic-energy accidents leading to fatalities is usually the adjective-noun sequence "fatal crash". But even this phrase is apparently more common among current or recent British subjects, at least journalistically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Lexis Nexis search for "fatal crash" in headlines during the past two years turns up 892 hits. Though there are many U.S. papers in the resulting list, a majority of the examples seem still to be from British Commonwealth sources (53 of them, vs. 12 U.S. papers). Comparing counts in specific papers supports the same conclusion: thus the Times of London has 28 instances of "death crash" in headlines and 25 of "fatal crash", vs. 0 and 17, respectively, in the New York Times.  The inquest concerning Diana's accident seems to account for only a small fraction of this difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pending a larger and better-controlled study (which I'll leave to someone else), it seems that stories about fatal crashes, under whatever description, simply play a larger role in British (journalistic?) culture overall. But why?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235912204741"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=476">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3fcc252ef12b7202</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience/Psychology"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="pareidolia"/><title type="html">Audio Pareidolia</title><published>2009-03-01T12:52:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T12:52:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=476" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been singing a popular song along with the radio when your friend turns to you and asks, “What are you singing?” The incredulous look on their face suggests to you that perhaps you are not singing the correct words, and eventually you both get a laugh at how horrendously you mangled the lyrics. I friend of mine, for example, once confessed that they thought that in the  song “little red corvet” Prince was singing “pay the rent collect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a form of audio pareidolia. Pareidolia is the neurological phenomenon of seeing a pattern or figure in random noise - a face in the clouds, or Jesus on a tortilla shell, for example. The images are not really there. There is just the suggestion of a face or some figure in the image and our brain does all work, finding the closest match to a recognized pattern, and then enhancing and even filling in details to create the illusion of a face or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio pareidolia is hearing words in sound that are not actually there. This can occur by misinterpreting words that are being said, or by hearing words in random noise. The phenomenon is the same as with visual pareidolia, in that the brain is searching for a recognized pattern, finds the closest match, and then processes the incoming sensory information to enhance the apparent match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example (sent in by Peter Davis) -&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM6xbDX5iHU"&gt; a Youtube video&lt;/a&gt; of what looks like a church group singing a song. Below are subtitles suggesting what they are saying - and this is sufficient suggestion to force a match between what you are hearing and the words in the subtitles. It’s pretty funny, but also a good demonstration of the effect. And here is a great one - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUm6XUFV8_U"&gt;alternate lyrics to Carmina Burana&lt;/a&gt; (a nerd favorite because of its use in the movie Excalibur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently on the SGU, a Who’s That Noisy segment was the &lt;a href="http://www.kjrh.com/news/local/story/UPDATED-Does-doll-deliver-Islamic-message/yjo4XNLDPUu0pVqBCLpJcQ.cspx"&gt;doll that allegedly says “Islam is the light.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes audio pareidolia can fool people into believing (or perhaps is driven by belief) in bizarre ideas. Here is &lt;a href="http://victorthebudgie.com/videopage.html"&gt;Victor the Budgie&lt;/a&gt; who, it is claimed, can not only speak but can speak in context, displaying an understanding of human speech. I recommend you listen to the video first without looking at the subtitles suggesting what the bird is supposed to be saying, then listen back watching with the subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio pareidolia also is common in the world of paranormal research - mostly with the alleged phenomenon known as EVP or electronic voice phenomenon. Here ghost “researchers” listen to hours of recorded audio until pareidolia kicks in for a word here or a phrase there. They then not only supply the words that are being said but the context as well. &lt;a href="http://www.evpzone.com/listen_to_evps.html"&gt;Here is a good page&lt;/a&gt; with lots of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics love talking about pareidolia, whether visual or audio, because it is right in the sweet spot of the skeptical skill set - understanding why people often come to dubious and even bizarre conclusions because they fail to understand the nature of the human mind. It’s also fun and easily demonstrated, and so it makes an excellent skeptical lesson - your brain can be fooled, you can be fooled, and in order to properly interpret this one needs only to understand a little bit about how our brains work. Our brain actively process sensory input, making many assmptions, and forcing fits to recognized patterns. Our brains do not give a truly objective and accurate representation of the world.

"Autism and Education," a February 28th &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/186960"&gt;My Turn&lt;/a&gt; column in &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/186960"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; by Stephanie Lindsley, hits home with me in more than one way. Lindsley's 8-year-old son is on the autism spectrum and "'tests in the 'severe' range in many subjects."  He is partially mainstreamed in a regular classroom with an aide and benefits greatly from the individualized attention----as would, Lindsley notes, her 12-year-old daughter, who "tests in the 95th percentile nationwide on standardized tests" and is in the public school's gifted program. And, is so bored at school that she "often hides a book in her desk and reads" and "resents being drilled over and over on something she learned in 10 minutes." Write Lindsley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine how much my daughter would excel if she had a program specifically geared to her strengths, one that challenged her creativity on a daily basis. Or if she received even half the individual attention my son receives every week. What if she had a person sitting next to her to encourage her to think of new ways of doing things? What if her teacher didn't have to manage a large classroom full of kids, who didn't scold her for "making things confusing for everyone else"? What would happen if she spent all day in a room with two to six other gifted children, along with a couple of adults who specialized in pushing them to realize their potential?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no "government mandate" for gifted education, Lindsley writes. So what children are really being left behind in our schools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i'm very familiar with the situation Lindsley describes for her son; my own son certainly benefits from the individualized education and one-on-one attention that he receives. While our school district has had to make some serious budget cuts, so far the special ed programs have yet to be touched, though I suspect this is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also more than sympathize with Lindsley's daughter. When I was her age, I felt exactly the same way about school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd been in gifted programs throughout elementary school and lucked out in the sixth grade, with a teacher who taught us about anthropology, the Inuit, and baboon behavior and encouraged me to write. Junior high in Oakland public schools was simply not challenging.  I was in the hardest classes and learned everything easily and quickly, and was very bored and, eventually, miserable and frustrated. I guess you can say that I've been feeling more than empathetic with Charlie's adolescent and middle school struggles---I actually ended up switching to a much smaller, private school, where I did very well, and indeed received more of the individualized attention that Lindsley notes would be so helpful for her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School was only part of it, though. I read and read, and in the different languages I was studying. I only had to take one---French---and somehow managed to learn Latin and ancient Greek. I did a lot of writing (all fiction and poetry) and read more, novels and poetry anthologies, and collected works of poets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it helped to go to a smaller school that was much more focused on academics, first and foremost. I suspect, though, that I would still have read all those books, and scrounged to learn as many languages as I could, and played viola in a youth orchestra. I equally suspect that without nearly nine years of education focused on his needs and individualized to his learning, that Charlie would not have come as far as he has----would not be a student (albeit in a self-contained classroom) in our local middle school, a kid who had a super successful dentist appointment early Friday morning (no cavities, what a relief) and raced to don his bike helmet and gloves for a chilly bike ride Saturday afternoon and who's started &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/doin_the_math"&gt;doing addition&lt;/a&gt; (on a calculator) in decimals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit of a rocky road for me at times and often I had to make my own path, but somehow I managed. I don't know more of the particulars of Lindsley's daughter's education than are noted in the &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/186960"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; article and I'm pulling for her---I do think all that reading she's doing is going to lead somewhere, yet unknown. I also know that, just a few years ago, the educational services for Lindsley's son and for mine were not at all available and it says something significant about our society, that we devote so many resources to students in special ed---that we provide teaching for students who, in the past and still all too often, are left far behind.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235903682429"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca4901c17fd6d096</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Is Solar Always Green?</title><published>2009-03-01T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/459-is-solar-always-green.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px groove #000000;margin:5px;float:right" alt="solarbus" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/solarbus.gif" height="140" width="400"&gt;Arguably, there can be no cleaner source of energy than the sun. If you place a black container filled with water in the sun, you'll heat water at no cost and with no appreciable environmental impact. That's well and good, but impractical if you want to take a shower at 3AM, or need to boil water for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what we need is electricity, as our culture is based on electrical devices. So how does one turn solar power into electricity? While you could &lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/london/renewable-energy/mailarchives/renew-energy/msg00066.html"&gt;create a solar furnace&lt;/a&gt; that boiled water to produce steam that powered a generator, the cost and size are prohibitive. It's far more reasonable to use solar panels. But are they "green"?&lt;/p&gt;

You can’t get away that easily. As a former Nazi youth, The Pope doesn’t take kindly to having people deny the Nazi atrocities. &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/02/27/holocaust.bishop/"&gt;The Vatican demands that Williamson clearly “distance himself” from the controversial comments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bishop Richard Williamson, who is now in England, issued a statement Thursday saying he regretted making the remarks. But he did not retract them or say he had changed his mind about the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have thought the Catholic Church was stupid, but I’ll have you know that just because the Catholic Church employs individuals to perform actual exorcisms and to investigate to determine if the face of Jesus on a taco is a legitimate miracle, that doesn’t make them–wait, where was I going with that again? I kinda lost my train of thought after the whole exorcism thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for those who forgot what Williamson had actually said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Swedish interview, which was broadcast in January but apparently recorded earlier, Williamson said, “I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against — is hugely against — 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler. I believe there were no gas chambers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just think, in 25 years, this douche will be out and able to commit more genocidal activities. Clearly justice has been served.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV is evolving rapidly to escape the human immune system, an international study led by Oxford University has shown. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrate the challenge involved in developing a vaccine for HIV that keeps pace with the changing nature of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Even in the short time that HIV has been in the human population, it is doing an effective job of evading our best efforts at natural immune control of the virus. This is high-speed evolution that we’re seeing in the space of just a couple of decades.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just another reason why you should never let a creationist doctor treat you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument over whether an outcrop of rock in South West Greenland contains the earliest known traces of life on Earth has been reignited, in a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Geological Society&lt;/em&gt;. The research, led by Martin J. Whitehouse at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, argues that the controversial rocks “cannot host evidence of Earth’s oldest life,” reopening the debate over where the oldest traces of life are located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists had dated the rocks originally at 3.85 billion years old, older than any other life we knew of. But the new research challenges the original dating, finding no evidence that they are any older than c. 3.67 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this puts John McCain back in the running as the possible oldest life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

This species of bird first appeared 50 million years ago and was extinct about 2.5 million years ago because of climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So again, the fossil is of a 10 million-year-old bird. Now for those keeping count that’s 9,994,000 years before the existence of the entire universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long timers here may recall that I &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/nina_paley/"&gt;mentioned this cool video&lt;/a&gt; by Nina Paley called &lt;i&gt;Sita Sings the Blues&lt;/i&gt; several years ago. At that time, all that was available were some short but very pretty clips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good news! &lt;a href="http://www.thirteen.org/sites/reel13/indies/indie-sita-sings-the-blues/241/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sita Sings the Blues&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is done, and available on the web. It&amp;#39;s Saturday evening — go ahead, set aside an hour and a half to watch it. How often do you run across Hindu myths animated and set to the 1920&amp;#39;s jazz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Hindu myths, have you ever read any of their creation stories? Here's one version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before time began there was no heaven, no earth and no space between.  A vast dark ocean washed upon the shores of nothingness and licked the edges of night.  A giant cobra floated on the waters.  Asleep within its endless coils lay the Lord Vishnu. He was watched over by the mighty serpent. Everything was so peaceful and silent that Vishnu slept undisturbed by dreams or motion.
From the depths a humming sound began to tremble, Om. It grew and spread, filling the emptiness and throbbing with energy. The night had ended.  Vishnu awoke.  As the dawn began to break, from Vishnu's navel grew a magnificent lotus flower. In the middle of the blossom sat Vishnu's servant, Brahma. He awaited the Lord's command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Vishnu spoke to his servant: 'It is time to begin.' Brahma bowed. Vishnu commanded: 'Create the world.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's silly and magical, but it's also beautiful. We hear that awful tinny poetry of Genesis so often that I think it's worth looking around at other cultures just to see how petty and third-rate the Western bible is. Not that I want anyone &lt;i&gt;believing&lt;/i&gt; in Vishnu and the lotus growing out of his navel, but at least it's much more lovely and imaginative than the repetitive nonsense we're used to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_greatest_break-up_story_ev.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/GynG_Dumrio" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235887067867"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=584">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e61f11cc4d433aa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="anti-vaccers"/><category term="Australian Government"/><category term="Dr Michael Wooldridge"/><category term="exemption"/><category term="immunisation"/><category term="Maternity Immunisation Allowance"/><title type="html">How to get the Maternity Immunisation Allowance without getting your kids vaccinated.</title><published>2009-03-01T05:52:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T05:52:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/03/01/how-to-get-the-maternity-immunisation-allowance-without-getting-your-kids-vaccinated/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I turned up about the &lt;a href="http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/maternity_allow.htm"&gt;Maternity Immunisation Allowance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="http://www.foodsecretariat.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-archive-mediarel-1997-mw1697.htm"&gt;established in 1997 by Dr Michael Wooldridge&lt;/a&gt;, the then Federal Minister for Health and Family Services, in response to low levels of immunisation in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new initiatives were designed to reach the 97 per cent of parents who are in favour of immunisation, but who did not finish the full vaccination regime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/baby-vaccination2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="baby-vaccination2" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/baby-vaccination2-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the launch, Dr Wooldridge said; “With such a high rate of acceptance of immunisation, it is appalling that only 53 per cent of Australian children are fully immunised for their age. This leaves all children at risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, whooping cough and German measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Present childhood immunisation rates in Australia are among the worst in western countries and lower than many Third World countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Wooldridge said the Federal Government was so concerned about the low rates of childhood immunisation that it had put its full weight behind an ambitious national strategy to significantly improve immunisation compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This included the introduction of the Maternity Immunisation Allowance, a non-means tested bonus to encourage parents to fully immunise their children and the offer of financial incentives to medical practitioners as part of the Better Practice Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Maternity Immunisation Allowance aims to encourage parents or guardians to fully immunise children in their care. Maternity Immunisation Allowance is a payment for children aged 18 to 24 months who are fully immunised or have an approved exemption from immunisation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can still get the money even if you don’t get your kids vaccinated. Following is an excerpt from the &lt;a href="http://www.familyassist.gov.au/internet/fao/fao1.nsf/content/payments-mia-exemptions.htm"&gt;exemption clause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a recognised immunisation provider (e.g. your doctor) signs a letter or form saying that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt; • they have told you about the benefits and risks of immunising your child and you have a conscientious objection to immunising your child (your provider should complete a Health Insurance Commission Immu-12 form),
&lt;p&gt;• immunising your child with a particular vaccine is medically contraindicated (your provider should use the Health Insurance Commission Immu-11 form),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• the child has a natural immunity to the disease, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• the vaccine is not available,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• you or your partner are a member of the Church of Christ, Scientist and you have a letter from an official of the Church advising that you are a practising member of the Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very interesting that this is never mentioned by the anti-vacc crowd. They are very quick to accuse GPs of being involved in some “big pharma” conspiracy since they also receive financial incentives to vaccinate and talk to parents about immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did they forget to mention they also get paid for leeching off the rest of us who do comply thereby benefiting from they herd immunity we provide? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as my mum who alerted me to this story said, if they are so opposed to vaccination shouldn’t they decline to take the money out of principle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/</id><title type="html">The Skeptics&amp;#39; Book of Pooh-Pooh</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235887067867"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=569">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d5404109f6a3bf1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Excuses"/><category term="anti-vaccination"/><category term="Australian Government"/><category term="centrelink"/><category term="Meryl Dorey"/><category term="mothers groups"/><category term="vaccine payout"/><title type="html">Government money for conscientious objectors?</title><published>2009-02-28T14:27:47Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T14:27:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/03/01/government-money-for-conscientious-objectors/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wanna get paid to not vaccinate?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0649276400.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border:1px solid black;margin:7px" title="0649276400" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0649276400-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="271"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished a conversation with my school friend who has two girls, one 15 months and the other 3 years, about vaccination. She relayed to me a story about her mothers and babies group where one such mother had steadfastly refused to have her kids immunised and was making a song and dance about the fact. This erked my friend, since she has been vigilant about getting both her girls immunised according to the Australian Government’s recommendations. She informed me that when you get your kids vaccinated in Australia, the government (in fact, Centrelink) send you $200 for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems they also send this money to conscientious objectors. The objector in question proudly told my friend she had signed a statutory declaration, under the watch of her GP, detailing her reasons for not having her kids vaccinated. Despite this, the Australian government still sent her the $200, normally reserved for those who have their kids immunised. This mother was very proud of the fact, which eventually resulted in her being involved in a rather large argument with the rest of the parents who were essentially protecting her child via herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting to know for me, as a non-parent, and as a person interested in the anti-vacc crowd, since they never seem to mention that you also get money for refusing to get your kids vaccinated. However, they are very quick to mention that doctors get paid for reporting the vaccination of kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypocrisy? I will do some further research and get back to you, but I smell a rat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/</id><title type="html">The Skeptics&amp;#39; Book of Pooh-Pooh</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235885733453"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2368">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca7965c4fbbc80b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1st Amendment Rights"/><category term="Education"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="Illinois"/><category term="atheists"/><category term="Johnsburg High School"/><category term="Savannah Lanz"/><title type="html">Atheist group in Illinois high school may be facing discrimination</title><published>2009-03-01T05:32:57Z</published><updated>2009-03-01T05:32:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/atheist-group-in-illinois-high-school-may-be-facing-discrimination/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student, Savannah Lanz, at Johnsburg High School in northwestern McHenry County, IL intends to start an atheist club at her school. And although there doesn’t seem to be anyone stopping her from forming an atheist club, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/02/28/high-school-student-faces-challenges-in-starting-an-atheist-group/"&gt;a far subtler form of discrimination seems to be occurring&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lanz said she was under the impression that the group — named the Johnsburg Freethinkers Society — had been approved by an assistant principal at the school, and &lt;strong&gt;simply wouldn’t be allowed to advertise with fliers in the building.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the club doesn’t print anything inappropriate in their fliers, the school has no legal right to stop prevent her from advertising the club. So if this is indeed the case, then the school has effectively opened themselves up to a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sidenote, it’s awesome to see teenage atheists actively organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

Naturally, those of us who know and love Hubble were &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/20/space-junk-1-science-0/"&gt;a tad concerned&lt;/a&gt; about this latest development, which would probably have led to a complete shutdown of the telescope in a year or two.  Hubble is currently the equivalent of a 1969 VW Beetle that’s scheduled for an upcoming episode of “Pimp My Ride” — it gets around town just fine at the moment, but we hope it keeps long running long enough to be tricked out during SM4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest news (or latest to me, since I just got a hold of the memo, which is actually about a week old), is that they’re cautiously optomistic that the servicing mission will be able to go ahead.  The key points given in the “settle down y’all” memo are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NASA is proceeding with plans for the STS-125 (SM4) servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope in May 2009. A safety and mission assurance review for SM4 is scheduled for April. An in-depth analysis of all the risks, including the potential orbital debris risk – something assessed before every mission – will be considered at that time.  NASA also will further assess debris risk at the mission’s flight readiness review, held routinely before each shuttle launch.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hubble servicing mission team is confident the debris risk will be acceptable for the flight, but it requires time for proper analysis. Currently, the team does not have an updated risk assessment for the STS-125 mission that includes the satellite collision on Feb. 10. A detailed analysis will be available in mid-March to develop mitigating strategies, such as alternating attitudes or adjustments to the planned spacewalks.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As NASA orbital debris experts continue to better define the risks to our spacecraft resulting from the collision, the Hubble servicing mission team will evaluate any potential additional risk caused by the collision.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other good news, assuming that the servicing mission goes, is that the astronauts are doing &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; well at speeding up the installation and/or repair of the new and refurbished instruments.  In terms of instruments, the servicing mission’s priorities are to install COS and WFC3, and, if there’s time, to repair STIS and ACS.  However, the repairs are limited by the numbers of EVA’s (extravehicular activities) and their duration.  Thus, the faster the repairs can go, the higher the chance that all 4 instruments will be up and running by the end of the mission.  The key to getting them all in is whether ACS can be repaired in one EVA, or split over two.  If it’s the latter, then there’s lots of packing and unpacking that has to be done at the beginning and end of each EVA, which adds a lot of overhead that could be spent actually fixing stuff.  The word is that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grunsfeld"&gt;John Grunsfeld&lt;/a&gt; (astronaut, astrophysicist, and veteran of previous servicing missions) is getting positively speedy at the repairs.  Moreover, he’s rumored to have a metabolism that doesn’t burn much oxygen, which means he can stay out on an EVA longer that mere mortals — kind of like Lance Armstrong, but in space.  This means he can probably fix ACS in one shot, which will help them get ahead of schedule.  So, if the mission goes in May as expected, the news from Hubble could be terrific.&lt;/p&gt;

Stuffing envelopes and stapling papers: These are the sorts of things too often taught to individuals on the autism spectrum who are transitioning from being teenagers to adults, according to educator Peter Gerhardt in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.somdnews.com/stories/02272009/rectop140843_32182.shtml"&gt;Southern Maryland Newspapers Online&lt;/a&gt;. "Getting a Life: Transition to Competent Adulthood for Young People with Autism" was the title of a presentation given by Gerhardt at the College of Southern Maryland Prince Frederick campus. Gerhardt emphasized that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;learning to be "interdependent" through transition and social interaction is far more vital to people with autism leading a full life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerhardt noted that none of us are "independent." "Independence" for some individuals on the autism spectrum need not have to mirror precisely what this terms means for many people. Rather, Gerhardt proposes that it's as important for individuals on the spectrum to learn to rely on others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this Gerhardt gave was teaching people with autism to go to Wal-Mart. He first spoke to the store's manager to explain what he was doing and to find out who was the best cashier for his students. He then spoke to that cashier and told her to "talk to them, not to me," when his students were purchasing their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once one person starts to [become comfortable working with autistic people], other people want to do it; other people want to get involved," Gerhardt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerhardt also discussed the transition that takes place when autistic individuals go to college or start full- or part-time employment. He said he felt that quality of life was always the most important aspect in either of these initiatives, though "intense instruction" is necessary for adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can teach you how to make copies but the real skill is what to do when something goes wrong," he said in regard to people with autism entering the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps especially here in the US, there's a tendency to equate adulthood---being a "successful" adult---with attaining a kind of "rugged individualism" and, indeed, a sort of freedom from being interdependent. Are we only preparing people for a kind of poor imitation of "independence" in teaching them to stuff envelopes and put flyers in folders---tasks which get labeled as "work" and a "job"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, Dora posted about the emphasis on teaching "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_skills_bridges_and_gaps_the_other_side_of_the_story"&gt;life skills&lt;/a&gt;":  Why can't certain "daily living skills" be the sphere of some, and other tasks for others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a serious need to rethink the content and the form of educating older students on the spectrum and adults requiring such; to reconsider what is "basic" not simply for "daily living skills," but for &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/18981/actually-journalists-do-take-some-of-the-blame-for-the-death-of-newspapers/" title=""&gt;Actually, Journalists do take some of the blame for the death of newspapers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But why is the business model dying?

&lt;p&gt;Competition is a factor, and blogs are obviously part of that mix. But again, if I'd started a business and someone else opened up down the street and offered a more appealing product, and I lost customers, would it be fair to blame the other guy alone for my problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a free market, we have competition. Yes, it can suck when you're not on the winning side. But there's nothing saying that you can't start a new business, or reform your existing one to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspapers remain wedded to print in a market that is switching to an all digital model. Newspapers offer a variety of news in a market that has moved strongly towards specialization (not exclusively, but more so than in the past.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If more and more people are no longer buying newspapers because the content has no appeal vs the competition, wouldn't at least some of the blame lie with the people who produce the newspaper content that fewer people now want to read?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/28/ice-ice-baby-when-fact-checking-is-not-fact-checking/" title=""&gt;Ice, Ice Baby: When Fact-Checking Is Not Fact-Checking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know that I may be sounding a bit Talmudic by spending so many blog posts on this one bit of information, but examining how these Post editors have dealt with it has proven to be very revealing. They never bothered to check with scientists about the validity of a statement in a column, and after thousands of people have complained, they recognize that there was something so amiss that should have called the scientists. But they still can't manage to make a decision about whether the statement requires a correction.

&lt;p&gt;What's more, they continue to ignore the broader, more important problem with Will's discussion of sea ice: the facts that picking out two days from a thirty-year time series is not a meaningful way to look at climate trends, and that climate models do not, in fact, lead you to expect a decrease in global ice cover. And they have not even taken any notice of all the other errors in Will's two columns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/the_george_will_affair.php?page=1" title=""&gt;The George Will Affair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A wide variety of scientists, journalists, bloggers, and pundits has refuted Will's arguments many times over in the week and a half since. A comprehensive list of those rebuttals, including an early entry from CJR, can be found here.

&lt;p&gt;-------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But his point about the wiggly, lawyerly language is especially germane because this is a classic case of evidence versus inference. The Post can argue that, technically, all of the evidence Will presents passed fact-checking; and Will can then infer what he wants about that evidence--even if his inferences differ drastically from those of the scientists who collected the evidence--without journalistic foul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/02/george_will_the_washington_pos.php" title=""&gt;George Will, the Washington Post, and the Death of Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some bloggers seem to think this piece is hard on them; precisely the opposite was intended. I think it's amazing that bloggers have basically destroyed the credibility of both George Will and the Washington Post editorial page. Both seem to deserve it; bloggers gave it to them. Bravo. But I also lament the decline of our newspapers--even though much of it is their own fault, as in this instance--and worry that without them, we won't be better off.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/02/the-george-will-scandal/" title=""&gt;The George Will Scandal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Something striking has happened over the past week in the dynamical relationship between the blogosphere and the rather gaunt-looking "mainstream media," or MSM, with respect to a science controversy. And watching it unfold makes one wonder if we aren't seeing a kind of turning-point moment in the transition--for better or worse--away from  newspapers as the dominant source of opinion, commentary, and thoughtful analysis in our society.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/27/unchecked-ice-a-saga-in-five-chapters/" title=""&gt;Unchecked Ice: A Saga in Five Chapters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I guess I don't understand editorial pages. The laws of physics must be different there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/02/the_reality_of_fact-checking_a.php" title=""&gt;The reality of fact-checking at daily newspapers: George Will is no exception&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, contrary to what many non-journalists seem to believe, George F. Will is a journalist. Just because he gets to add interpretation and value judgment to the factual material that serves as his raw material doesn't mean he gets to flout the ethical parameters of the business. In other words, he is obliged to represent the source material he cites fairly and accurately. If he doesn't then he's violating his contract with his employer and his obligation to his readers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/02/does_what_george_will_thinks_a.php" title=""&gt;Does what George Will thinks about climate change really matter?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was trying to be polite, but the conversation quickly slid into the frustration so many in the room, not just me, have with climate science denialism. Here's the thing: If Will is right, and there is no global warming, then much of what we think we know about chemistry and biology and ecology and thermodynamics and geology and physics is wrong. If Will is right, then thousands of climatologists are not only wrong, but participating in a global conspiracy to conceal the truth about the state of the planet's ecosystem. The climatologists have nothing to gain from perpetuating the "lie" of anthropogenic global warming, but they're doing it anyway, just to be mean.

&lt;p&gt;And if that isn't the silliest idea since the 8-track tape, I don't know what is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/02/george_will_lies_music_to_my_e.php" title=""&gt;George Will Lies; His Editor Does Nothing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are many problems with this philosophy, but those are irrelevant, since George Will made factual errors rather than debatable inferences. Once again, he wrote that "according to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, there has been no recorded global warming for more than a decade." There is no inference there. Will isn't saying he disagrees with the WMO's interpretation of the data, he's saying the WMO thinks there's been no recorded warming for more than a decade. The WMO doesn't think this. No serious scientific organization thinks this.

&lt;p&gt;It's a sad display from one of our great papers. The Post still has a lot of talented and hardworking writers; this is a slight to them all. In these difficult times, the paper ought to be striving to show it's still relevant. Instead, it shows us that at least at the editorial/oped page, they don't choose well between the truth on the one hand, and making such an eminence as George Will retract on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/02/once_more_into_the_breach.php" title=""&gt;Once more into the breach&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do I put this politely?

&lt;p&gt;It is not possible for a reasonable person equipped with a secondary education to read the material George F. Will cites in his columns arguing against the scientific evidence for global warming and come to the conclusions that Will reaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/02/my_email_to_fred_hiatt_of_the.php" title=""&gt;My Email to Fred Hiatt of the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Mr. Hiatt, [Introductory Comments]...I believe what I've called the "Republican War on Science" continues, and the George Will saga represents a stunning example. In my opinion, the Post editorial/oped page makes a terrible mistake by not correcting his manifest errors; but leave that aside--you've said people should instead "debate him." Would you publish an oped by me exposing Will's egregious errors, misrepresentations, and distortions of the science of global warming, and thus further debate?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inkstain.net/fleck/?p=3418" title=""&gt;In Defense of Walter Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was trying to learn the craft of writing about the earth, a geologist who was serving as my guide said I had to read Walter Sullivan's Continents in Motion. The book was a revelation to me - for the skill with which Sullivan explained the science of plate tectonics, but more importantly for the nuance with which he explained how science works: the fits and starts, the struggle to find data, the even greater struggle to find theory to structure and think about what that data is telling us.

&lt;p&gt;----------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a great deal of time recently studying climate science during that time period (see here for the result). If newspaper journalism is the first draft of history, Sullivan's work needs very little editing. It is anything but a megaphone of global cooling alarm, but rather a rich account of the complex science of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.chicagoreader.com/chicagoland/2009/02/27/come-back-tell-you-all-i-shall-tell-you-all-chicag/" title=""&gt;Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all: The Chicago Journalism Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of the people newspapers pay to write are not just competing against people who write for free, they are competing against people who write better than they do, and those people are compelled to write because they are experts, which they are paid to be.

&lt;p&gt;------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now anyone with a computer can read those, and thousands of other professional and amateur equivalents. You can also use this thing called Twitter and it's kind of like reading a Richard Roeper column (you can even follow Richard Roeper on Twitter, but it's less interesting than most Twitter feeds). Look at it economically: the value of Richard Roeper, star columnist, has declined due to market forces. There are a lot of people offering the same or better service. The Roeper Bubble has burst. And I don't mean to pick on Richard Roeper. Well, actually I do, but there are more grave examples. Take David Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More simply: journalists have historically been paid by newspapers to call up experts and talk to them (I have done this many times), and to then relay that information back to the reader. Now many of those experts write. For readers. It saves them time, and usually a lot of stupid questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's getting close to a week after the Chicago Journalism Town Hall, on which I was a panelist along with 13 other of the city's media luminaries (that there were far more watching us supposed experts from the audience speaks to the depth and breadth of talent in Chicago -- any number of them could have taken our place.) You can listen to the three hour discussion in two parts on chicagopublicradio.org. I'd hoped to jump right into the fray here on the blog, but work has kept me from getting my thoughts out in print.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/gore-and-will-and-climate-and-the-press/" title=""&gt;Gore, Will, Climate and Complexity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many climate scientists, bloggers and readers have weighed in this morning online and in my in-box to complain about my short print story assessing the risk of overstatement or inaccuracy facing everyone pressing an argument about climate science and policy. (I'll include some examples in the comment thread this morning.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orient-lodge.com/node/3442" title=""&gt;NPR and Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is Saturday morning. I turn on my laptop and check various websites; new friends to add on Facebook, Tweets to reply to on Twitter. I grab a cup of coffee and tune in Weekend Edition on NPR. I am not alone. NPR has just run a story about Twitter, and Andy Carvin's efforts to get Dan Schorr to use Twitter. In the world of Twitter, it is a big story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.philebrity.com/2009/02/27/editorial-the-32-theory/" title=""&gt;Editorial: The 32% Theory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you break down the percentages, that means a full 37% percent of what was in the paper was either shit you could get anywhere or shit you'd never want at all. And among the remaining 63%, let's charitably assume that half of that news had been available prior via TV, radio, or Internet. That leaves you with a daily newspaper that is -- again, charitably -- 32% relevant. That's not good.

&lt;p&gt;Now, let's plug the human element back in. The fact of it is simple: Print media is fast becoming a boutique medium -- it will always be around, but will never again employ the number of people it does today, and certainly never again the number that it did thirty years ago. Some -- many, even -- of these people are talented, and all of them, as human beings, deserve jobs. What will become of them? Some will hang on until the house burns down completely, some will find other fields of employ, others will strike upon a new model, one that is desperately needed as news itself continues to dumb itself down throughout all media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/02/breaking-press-corps-incredulous-that.html" title=""&gt;BREAKING: Press Corps Incredulous That Obama Budget Reflects Campaign Promises&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It felt like a primal whine from rich reporters. Hasn't Barack Obama considered that maybe John McCain's tax policy is the right one? Does Obama not realize that the best way to be a Democrat is preserve conservative Republican tax policy?

&lt;p&gt;-----------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a remarkable scene, Gibbs patiently and repeatedly explained that, no really, Obama actually won the election, that he'd explained exactly what he was going to do during the campaign, the American people understood and voted on it, and now he's doing it. During the campaign, Obama had pledged to cut taxes for 95% of American workers and end the catastrophic non-workingness of George Bush's trickle-down tax policy. Now, among some questioners, there seems to be confusion and alarm that Obama intends to implement that policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sour mood of the elite press corps was apparent from the first question, by the Associated Press' Jennifer Loven. Noting Obama's quote from earlier today, "There are times when you can afford to redecorate your house and there are times when you have to focus on rebuilding its foundation," Loven asked whether it was appropriate that the Obamas conduct any re-decorations in the White House as they settle in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one reporter observed after the briefing, "Did you notice all the questions about taxes came from reporters making over $250,000 a year, especially the TV guys?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/column/the_monday_papers_142.php" title=""&gt;The [Monday] Papers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A column is based on the length of a column of type!" Ann Marie Lipinski once explained to me in frustration, when explaining why one of her former columnists was at odds with the paper because he wanted his columns to jump. (And many newspaper columnists today still act as if that artificial length was handed down by God as optimal, or that there is something valuable about news stories filed at 6 p.m. that sit around until 6 a.m. before anyone sees them.)

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but not only is that an artificial constraint, but columns are of different lengths in different-sized publications. And besides that, aren't journalists the ones who should know better than any that rules are made to be broken? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One scenario discussed on Sunday was a city without a newspaper. Inherent in the discussion was the false notion that that meant a city without news. Somehow I think chicagotribune.com - or its remnants - will stay alive if the rest of the company sinks. And if not, that's a whole lot of reporters and business folk who could re-band together immediately on the Web. It's just not a useful discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more unbelievable is the notion that somehow serendipity is lost in the Internet. The Internet is a case study in serendipity! Ever hear of the term surfing? That's serendipity! But then, I seem to remember reading that the youth of America were wasting their lives surfing the Internet. Better to surf the newspaper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Carol Marin, but when she said that you could create something, but how would you drive traffic to it I almost had to revoke my membership in her fan club. Meanwhile, Nate Silver reports that folks are "throwing money" at him. A year ago, Silver's site didn't exist and he had no traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/column/the_eric_zorn_papers.php" title=""&gt;The [Eric Zorn] Papers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Robust local online news operations aren't going to spring up fully formed. But the examples I've listed are indeed going concerns. Online sites have been included in the Pulitzer Prize competition for the first time this year. It takes time. But newspapers should already be there; they have squandered their tremendous advantage, and I don't think anyone in the industry seriously argues otherwise. And why does a concern have to be self-sustaining through advertising? There are other models. Maybe MinnPost and other new sites are the newspapers of the future. Would that be so wrong? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beachwoodreporter.com/column/the_thursday_papers_148.php" title=""&gt;The [Thursday] Papers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Besides that, limiting access to your product is madness. Thanks to the Internet, the Tribune now has more readers than it's ever had in its history. And the ability to know something about those readers to tell advertisers, to tailor editorial content, to create community, to interact, and to sell services and products to is virtually unlimited.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I've said and written before, if you want to try to put your crappy feature stories behind a firewall, go right ahead. I recommend not writing them instead and focusing on unique content, which means local reporting first and foremost, though not merely conducted in the same crappy traditional way. And this reporting should never have a price tag put on it - not in a democracy. There are many other revenue streams to tap; just look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I would say that you can't just put up your existing print content and park ads around them and expect that to be the model. The new business model is a new CONTENT model . . . the nature of content can and should change on the web in all sorts of ways, and that creates new ad models too . . . I don't know why everyone is so quick to declare online advertising dead except as wish fulfillment; to the contrary, it's just in its infancy! We don't even know what metrics to use yet, advertisers are still unknowledgeable about the web, sales forces largely aren't selling it, and the new media products still haven't been developed . . . the Web model is every bit a new content model as anything; the advertising model will follow, but the only thing different about the business model itself will be a wider array of revenue streams available."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand and reiterate, you can't just put your old content on the Web and think you can slap ads around it and that's that. Your old content, by and large, sucks. And it's not reported, written or edited for the Web. You might as well slap radio transcripts on the Web and think you're now doing Internet journalism; you're not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thesocialpath.com/2009/02/could-bloggers-be-sued-for-telling-the-truth.html" title=""&gt;Could bloggers be sued for telling the truth?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you've ever worked in journalism, you've probably heard the expression, "Truth is the ultimate defense against libel."

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not, according to a new court decision that could leave countless bloggers and other citizen journalists exposed to libel suits for true statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2009/02/west_seattle_blog_is_so_hot_ri.php" title=""&gt;West Seattle Blog Is So Hot Right Now&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know I'm stating the obvious, but if I brought anything away from last night's journalist mash-up, No News Is Bad News, it's that West Seattle Blog is HOT, HOT SHIT right now.

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the event was ... well, I don't remember. But, what it became was a chance for 150ish journalists and a few of their subjects to come together in one room, talk about the state of the industry, pontificate on how we got where we are and who's to blame, and toss around ideas for how to save QUALITY JOURNALISM (not necessarily ink and paper). West Seattle Blog, perhaps more than any other voice in the room, is demonstrating an idea, a business model, and a way to preserve local journalism. They have skin in the game. They're making it work. They're not just talking about it, they're doing it. And doing it well. But they're not saying they've found the digital news solution, either. They've found something that works in West Seattle, not necessarily the rest of the country or even the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lostremote.com/2009/02/26/journalisms-fatal-disconnect-with-business/" title=""&gt;Journalism's fatal disconnect with business&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;By splitting journalism and business into two buckets separated by a longstanding cultural divide, the two groups fail to collaborate on ideas that tap the strengths of both. And neither have a track record of understanding how technology enables community, the greatest opportunity of all. In fact, nearly three-quarters of local online news consumers say newspapers have failed in providing a sense of community and "connective tissue" in their local cities and neighborhoods (Forrester Research 2009). After all, most journalists want to control the conversation. So do the sales folks. So you need a third element: creative technology folks, empowered with resources, who can infuse community in content and revenue generation, providing value to both users and businesses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7913400.stm" title=""&gt;Crisis in the US newspaper industry &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever model the newspapers of the future adopt, the current crisis is likely to put at least some titles out of business, with only the strongest surviving.

&lt;p&gt;Less competition could mean more business for the survivors and the industry is likely to consolidate, with cities and regions being served by fewer newspapers; we could perhaps see a truly national newspaper market develop in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with US newspapers competing with one another, as well as with international news providers (including the BBC), there would still be plenty of choice for news consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"With even half a dozen papers, the American newspaper industry will be more competitive than it was when there were hundreds," writes Michael Kinsley. "Competition will keep the Baghdad bureaus open and the investigative units stoked with dudgeon."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "crisis" in the newspaper industry may, therefore, be more of a crisis for the journalists and publishers who are currently facing job losses and bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if it is merely the quantity, but not the quality, of journalism that declines then - for readers - there may not be a crisis at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090225/0302243897.shtml" title=""&gt;No, The Death Of Newspapers Does Not Mean An Age Of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A few folks have sent in Paul Starr's long but thoughtful article in The New Republic, which worries that, thanks to newspapers dying, we'll be entering a new age of corruption, since no one will be watching government officials like investigative reporters have in the past. The article is well worth reading, and brings up a number of interesting points -- but, in the end, fails to make a compelling case for a number of reasons -- most specifically that it relies on both a faulty model of news production and a faulty understanding of economics. This isn't to knock Starr or the article, because the mistakes are subtle, but important.

&lt;p&gt;The first mistake is in looking at news production itself -- and specifically investigative reporting. Starr seems to significantly overestimate how much investigative reporting newspapers do. In fact, investigative reporting is a fairly new phenomenon and has never been a major focus of newspapers. Those bemoaning the supposed "loss" of this function don't seem to recognize how little money has been put towards such investigative reporting in the past. As that second link suggests, most newspapers spend more on their comics pages than on investigations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://recoveringjournalist.typepad.com/recovering_journalist/2009/02/guest-post-the-powers-that-were.html" title=""&gt;The Powers That Were&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, the tradition of great journalism that many pundits seem to romanticize is a relatively recent development. Before Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, there wasn't a lot of investigative journalism at most papers; it really exploded in the '80s. The financial success that Chris cites also allowed the professionalism of a lot of newsrooms that were pretty crummy a generation ago. We need to find new ways to preserve quality journalism-but it's anything but a divine right, and btw, there's no reason why newspapers should think they have a monopoly on it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xark.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/02/whos-watching-the-watchdogs.html" title=""&gt;Who's watching the Watchdogs?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Goose a few newspaper journalists these days and they're likely to exclaim something about why Americans should care about saving their industry. And it's likely to sound something like this: "Without us protecting the public as investigative watchdogs, government corruption is going to run amok!"

&lt;p&gt;Which might be a compelling point, were it not for five little things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's try this another way, shall we? Sure, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with newspapers conducting investigative journalism -- in fact, I hope they choose to do more of it. But let's consider for a moment the possibility that newspapers have done at least as much to encourage bad behavior by government and business as they've done to curb it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder who does most of the public-policy grunt work in America? For the good guys, it's typically underpaid crusaders at civic-minded non-profit groups, people who care about clean water and safe food and healthy children other such left-wing nonsense. Newspapers count on these scruffy muckrackers, even though they typically distance themselves from their "radical" agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of what passes for watchdog investigative reporting is based on studies conducted by these pesky non-profits, or by anonymous government underlings in some state auditor's office, or the federal GAO, and so on. They produce the proof, editors build stories around their findings, and each year on press awards night, some reporters get plaques that credit them with the whole enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there newspaper reporting, investigative or otherwise, that takes on a public-policy issue and challenges ruling orthodoxy without a boost from an interest group? Probably. But newspapers generally refuse to poke the status-quo without being able to cite some interest group for raising the issue. Wanna know why? Because the status quo is where the money and power are. Do the math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In journalists' romantic private world, they are working-class heroes confronting the powerful on behalf of the powerless, and that happy myth is hard to give up. In truth, they are effectively limited by the compromises inherent in their business and our society. Newspapers simply will not long engage in unpopular whistleblowing, or in watchdogging that hurts their circulation. Medicare watchdogging isn't sexy, and the people who benefit from it aren't valuable to advertisers, yet newspaper advocates promote a system that leaves the watchdogging function to a secretive guess about which stories will be the most valuable to the paper, not society. Is this supposedly important role really something that's best left to such furtive whims? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's mediascape is a remnant of a collapsing 20th century system in which most of the journalistic infrastructure belonged to newspapers. Their current argument for their social value oozes irony because it reverses the way newspapers have valued themselves for a generation -- not for their civic-mindedness, but for their bottom line. And if that bottom line is less than 20 percent profit, you can bet they're laying off reporters, not offering stockholders smaller dividend payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody should investigate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2009/02/25_ideas_for_re.php" title=""&gt;25 ideas: Creating An Open-Source Business Model For Newspapers &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm just one of many people coming up with business ideas for saving newspapers. There are a lot of posts being published on this subject.

&lt;p&gt;Someone should collect all the advice because it's turning into some kind of open source business model. And the beauty of this approach is that only a few newspapers need to have the courage to try new ideas--if any one of them succeeds then the rest can piggyback. They win and we win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my 25 ideas on how newspapers might be able to survive and become innovative media businesses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stoweboyd.com/ground/2009/02/failing-.html" title=""&gt;Failing: The NY Times And Andrew Revkin Blow The George Will Story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But there aren't two sides to this, just because Will and company want there to be, or because the American population doesn't know what to think. 40% of Americans don't believe in evolution, but the NY Times doesn't portray that as a scientific debate. Likewise, 25% of Americans think the Sun circles the Earth, but that doesn't warrant 4 inches in the newshole.

&lt;p&gt;Revkin -- and the NY Times -- had another chance to say that public opinion on climate change, perhaps the most critical issue we face, is simply and clearly wrong. Climate change is not a topic debated by serious scientists anymore: it is taken as a given that the climate is changing, faster than we expected, and it is speeding up. This is due to human impact, principally in the form of CO2 emissions. No debate left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media have an obligation to get to the real scientific bottom of these stories, not just offer up the arguments of two hypothetical sides, and leave it to the reader to figure out whether Will is right or Gore was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://benatlas.com/2009/02/the-five-question-interview-jay-rosen/" title=""&gt;The Five Question Interview - Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The program in which I got my PhD at NYU (1986) was the kind of program McLuhan said he wanted to establish. In it, we studied the history of communication systems from speech-the first medium-through writing, printing, telegraph, telephone, radio, TV, looking not at the devices themselves but at, say... the problems of cultural memory in an oral culture, or "craft literacy" where a group controls access to the writing system and thus to priestly authority. The democratizing influence of print in the Protestant reformation. The disruptive influence of photography on realism in painting. The information science of code breaking- where I first met my friends, signal and noise. It was a great subject to study and very good preparation for the Web.

&lt;p&gt;McLuhan and Postman were both creatures of print civilization, masters of literacy, who were able to break the page. They were ready to "unlearn dead concepts," a phrase from Postman's books. I was also influenced by the semiotics of Roland Barthes, a French critic who was big when I was in grad school. McLuhan and Barthes were doing something very similar in the 1950s: short essays about advertisements and myth. (Appreciate the simple definition for myth that Barthes had: "many signifiers, one signified.") I made my first acquaintance with the curmudgeons of the world in studying the reactions McLuhan got from "big literature" around 1964-67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/22/a-wrinkle-in-ice-or-not/" title=""&gt;A Wrinkle In Ice (or Not)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's been a wrinkle in the global warming fact-checking saga I've been following this week.

&lt;p&gt;Just to recap-George Will wrote a column claiming that global warming's a lot of hype. He made a number of misleading statements, including one that was rejected by the very scientists he claimed as his source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/02/washington_post_stands_by_climate_change_denialism.php" title=""&gt;Washington Post Stands By Climate Change Denialism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This started as a problem for Will, his direct supervisors, and the Post's ombudsman. But now that the Post as a paper is standing behind Will's deceptions, I think it's a problem for all the other people who work at the Post. Some of those people do bad work, which is too bad. And some of those people do good work. And unfortunately, that's worse. It means that when good work appears in the Post it bolsters the reputation of the Post as an institution. And the Post, as an institution, has taken a stand that says it's okay to claim that up is down. It's okay to claim that day is night. It's okay to claim that hot is cold. It's okay to claim that a consensus existed when it didn't. It's okay to claim that George Will is a better source of authority on interpreting the ACRC's scientific research than is the ACRC.

So now’s your big chance. A &lt;a href="http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2009/02/28/news/local/21-weakwords.txt"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; will tell you the way things are out here in the rugged mountain west. We don’t use weak, wimpy words in this part of the country. No, siree. We drink strong coffee, we drive power vehicles, and we don’t use weak, wimpy language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who remember the fallen Montana war hero, Lt. Col. Gary Derby, recently killed in one of the many wars going on these days, have only good things to say about him, including the fact that he insisted that the troops under his command avoid weak, wimpy words, like “I think,” “I might,” and “maybe.” You have to be strong, firm, and optimistic if you’re going to command your troops. Lt.Col. Derby did this very well. But this got me thinking about what happens when academic linguists testify in lawsuits. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Academics are carefully trained to qualify the conclusions they make from their findings, using expressions like “a majority of,” “usually,” “often,” “may occur,” and “can affect.” Of course they usually can back up their words with numbers, percentages, and statistical measures, but it’s often  difficult for them to be able to say that their findings lead to absolute conclusions on the scale of anything. Language, like much of social science, has to deal with many variables, mostly human, so arriving at absolute, black and white conclusions can be usually difficult, if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet when linguists testify in lawsuits, they run smack dab into the conflicting goals of the legal system, where triers of the facts have to find defendants in criminal cases either guilty or innocent and opposing sides in civil cases have to either win or lose. This black and white situation is not what academics are used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic researchers are used to defining the problem they want to work on, then collect the data that is relevant to its solution.  Not so in court cases, where the problem is the legal issue and the data, called evidence, usually has already been assembled for analysis. There’s not much linguists can do about that. They have to work with what’s given them.  Working with trial evidence can be interesting, but it’s very different from the type of work that usually produces academic papers and books, where it’s obligatory to define the problem, to collect appropriate data, and to describe the variability and account for it. Absolute conclusions are uncommon in such  work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when linguists take the witness stand, retaining lawyers often need more than this. That’s understandable, because lawyers need the linguistic analyses to come closer to absolute conclusions than experts may or should want to go. So sometimes testimony can become a battle between linguists who try to stay within the boundaries of acceptable academic behavior and the retaining lawyers, who need strong conclusions to support their own need for an absolute conclusion. Occasionally lawyers will push their expert  witnesses to move closer to their own courtroom goal of winning, and this should not be surprising, for after all, the ethical principles of the legal profession require them to do the best job they can to win the case for their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some linguistics expert witnesses succumb to the temptation and join in with the advocacy of their retaining lawyers. When they do so, they abandon the ethical principles of their science. This is a great temptation that experts can slip into easily.  But doing so can give all expert witnesses a bad name. When they join with the lawyers’ advocacy, they move closer to the common criticism of expert witnesses—only one more  “hired gun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to Lt. Col. Derby. He wanted his soldiers to be strong and firm. With the best of intentions, he wanted them to avoid language that is weak and wimpy. Stressing this may be very important for combat troops, where winning and losing are in the balance, and it also may be good for courtroom lawyers, where winning is the ultimate goal. But it doesn’t often fit well with scientific analysis, including the analysis linguists can present in lawsuit trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postscript: You have may noticed that in this post, I, a linguist, have used weak and wimpy expressions over and over again. Look back, if you feel so inclined, and you’ll find a lot of &lt;em&gt;usually, can, may, seem, some,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;. Good thing I’m not a soldier or trial lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235862830978"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1120">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff85ea86d1269d94</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Briffa On Fluoridation</title><published>2009-02-28T21:31:30Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T21:31:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/briffa-on-fluoridation/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Dr John Briffa has a blog.

Not every mutation under positive selection responds to a change in selection: beneficial changes also occur at evolutionary equilibrium, repairing previous deleterious changes and restoring existing functions. Adaptation, by contrast, is viewed here as a non-equilibrium phenomenon: the genomic response to time-dependent selection. Our approach extends the static concept of fitness landscapes to dynamic fitness seascapes. It shows that adaptation requires a surplus of beneficial substitutions over deleterious ones. Here, we focus on the evolution of yeast and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; genomes, providing examples where adaptive evolution can and cannot be inferred, despite the presence of positive selection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;No it isn't.  No they don't.  Oh, by the way, the authors appear to be physicists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mustonena, V. and Lässiga, M.  2009.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/"&gt;Kepler&lt;/a&gt;, the telescope designed to look for Earthlike planets around nearby stars, is due to launch on a Delta II on March 6. That’s still to be confirmed, but it looks good. Kepler will stare at about 100,000 stars and look for periodic dimming in them due to an orbiting planet passing in front of the star. It will be able to detect planets the size of Earth orbiting sunlike stars, so we may be on the verge of a very large breakthrough in exoplanet astronomy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;a href="http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt; the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; is due to launch on May 20. This is an ambitious Moon probe that will be able to take images of the lunar surface with a resolution of &lt;em&gt;half a meter&lt;/em&gt;. Years ago I tried to pressure NASA to take Apollo landing site images and make them a high priority — I think the PR value alone would be fantastic, plus I’m curious to see how things may have changed. I expect the nylon in the flags has long ago succumbed to solar UV bombardment. But the rovers and landers will be big enough to see, though fuzzy. How cool would that be? I have no idea if they plan on doing that or not — as &lt;a href="http://www.chicon.org/gohs/baen.htm"&gt;Jim Baen once said&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;I just think that the space program reminds me of a government agency&amp;quot; — but maybe they’ll do it. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get launch news about non-Shuttle related rockets at NASA’s &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/status/index.html"&gt;Expendable Launch Vehicle Status Reports page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235854243439"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/what-george-will-should-have-written/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b8a4045a8b545424</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Reporting on climate"/><category term="Arctic and Antarctic"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">What George Will should have written</title><published>2009-02-28T20:42:26Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T20:42:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/what-george-will-should-have-written/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've avoided piling on to the George Will &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/27/unchecked-ice-a-saga-in-five-chapters/"&gt;kerfuffle&lt;/a&gt;, partly because this was not a new story for us (we'd commented on very similar distortions in previous columns in &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/will-full-ignorance/"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/04/incurious-george/"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;), but mostly because &lt;a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/02/george-f-will-takes-on-science-loses.html"&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/02/the_importance_of_actually_rea.php"&gt;else&lt;/a&gt; seems to be doing a great job in pointing out the problems in his recent columns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are actually quite gratified that a much wider group of people than normal have been involved in calling out this latest nonsense, taking the discussion well outside the sometimes-rarefied atmosphere of the scientific blogosphere (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wiki/index.php?title=George_Will"&gt;summary of links&lt;/a&gt;). Maybe RealClimate has succeeded in its original aim of increasing the wider awareness of the scientific context? However, like many, we are profoundly disappointed in the reaction of the Washington Post editors and George Will himself (though the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/02/27/ST2009022702494.html"&gt;ombudsman's column&lt;/a&gt; today is a step in the right direction). It would have been pleasant to see an example of the conservative punditocracy actually learning something from the real world instead of resorting to ever-more unconvincing pseudo-legalistic justifications and attacks on the messenger to avoid taking their head out of the sand. Nonetheless, in a moment of naive optimism, we have allowed ourselves to indulge in a fantasy for how a more serious columnist might have dealt with the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The scientific method in journalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Feb 29th, 2009, Washington post&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This column recently reported and commented on some developments pertinent to the debate about whether global warming is occurring and what can and should be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that I am a critic of  sensationalism in the coverage of environmental issues and that I have a philosophical preference for reality-based policies over those based on the ideologically-based fantasies of those I critique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last column, I reported on a statistic concerning sea ice extent - that global sea ice extent is unchanged since 1979 - that was trivially shown to be untrue, and for that I apologize. Rather than throw the fact checkers in my office or at the Washington Post under the bus, I take full responsibility for the mistake. However, as with good scientific practice, this provides an example of how journalism too can learn from its mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of the original quote was a Daily Tech blog post published in early January. While that post itself was heavily criticized as being misleading, it did use data from a reliable scientific source which was technically accurate at the time. My error was in assuming that scientific 'facts' don't change over a month or two and thus it was not necessary to revisit the source of the original data before writing my column. What was true in January would still be true in February, right? Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn't consider was that in complex and noisy data there are always going to be outliers, and in heavily politicised subjects there will always be people who will want to exploit a chance occurrence for a sound-bite. I should of course have known better since I decry this practice on a regular basis in discussions of economic issues. Through a combination of wishful thinking and time constraints, my failure to recognize a piece of classic cherry-picking lay at the heart of this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes old dogs do learn new tricks. The surprising fact (to me at least) that the difference in global sea ice between two single dates 30 years apart can change so radically in such a short space of time, implies that it is not a particularly good measure of long term climate change. It is a bit like looking at a single stock to gauge the health of the economy. Unfortunately (for me at least), it also validates the scientific consensus about the original article. It was indeed a misleading statistic, and I was indeed misled. Next time I will try and be more careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There continues to be a pressing need for an informed conservative discussion of the issues of climate change. Voices such as Senator John McCain, and businessman Jim Manzi (writing in the &lt;del&gt;Nation last year&lt;/del&gt; National Review in 2007) can perhaps show the way. The distraction of the last week over exact parsings and interpretations of technical data are just a sideshow while real decisions are already being made every day in Washington. In order for conservatives to have a voice at those tables, we need to be seen as serious contributors. Every time we are mislead by amateur bloggers, we lose another chance to influence policy. This may have been useful as a delaying tactic in the past, but now that there is clear leadership in the White House, this serves only to marginalize conservatives even further. Unlikely as it may seem for me to quote President Obama approvingly, it may be time for us to put aside childish things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is kind of funny to me as I was often admonished in school for doodling, teachers insisting that I was not paying attention.  I made more than one teacher extra irritated by echoing back enormous portions of the lecture they were giving in what I thought was honest proof of my actually paying attention.  This admonishment about "not paying attention" also followed on the heels of me tapping, rocking, moving in any way or pretty much doing anything besides sitting completely still--ironically something that will cause me to become utterly &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;able to pay attention.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doodle study reminds me of the &lt;a href="http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/Plain_English_Summaries/knowledge_communication_learning/knowledge/index405.aspx?ComponentId=9673&amp;amp;SourcePageId=11764"&gt;eye contact study&lt;/a&gt; that included key findings such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * It is relatively easy to train five year olds to avert their gaze more when answering questions. This increases their ability to answer both verbal and arithmetical questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Children develop the use of gaze aversion as a concentration tool during their fifth year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * In the laboratory, children averted their gaze less when interviewed across a live video link than when interviewed face to face. However, question difficulty had an enormous impact on the amount that children averted their gaze from the interviewer in both situations. This suggests that children avert their gaze when answering difficult questions to avoid the extra mental effort of monitoring faces, rather than for social reasons, such as embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have often been accused of not paying attention by teachers (and others) because of not making eye contact, when ironically staring at eyeballs is a sure way to white out any ability I have to understand anything at all.  These days my accommodations sheet I give to my professors literally says, "it is important to note that repetitive 'fidgeting' motions and lack of eye contact are not an indication that I am disinterested or not paying attention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one believes these concentration and memory studies though, my "autistic behaviors" are not so wacky after all, since it seems these behaviors may be of general benefit  to human beings in concentration and memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; wacky to me is the difference in attitude about these behaviors depending on whether they are discussed in the context of autism or outside of the context of autism.  For people who are not on the spectrum, doodling and gaze aversion are considered possibly valuable concentration aids.  For people who are on the spectrum, these same behaviors are considered "mysterious" and pathological and to be trained out of a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I was presenting at the &lt;a href="http://www.aamr.org/content_520.cfm?navID=144"&gt;AAIDD annual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, and my fellow autistic co-presenter said to the audience something to the effect of, "if you ever twitch or tap the end of your pencil to concentrate to relieve tension, then you understand some of the main reasons why many autistic people stim."  There followed an "a-ha" moment rippling through the audience then, and comments afterwards regarding the importance of making that connection in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many opportunities for understanding each other are lost because of constantly viewing autistic behavior as bizarre pathology instead of as being motivated by some of the same reasons it is for people who aren't labeled autistic?  I may fidget more often and more unusually than non-autistics, but I also expect maintaing concentration in some situations is more difficult for me due to my autism.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only were they all awesome, during the show Paul and Storm called up Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy from MST3K to play robot zombies, and Jonathan Coulton did “Creepy Doll”, with the second verse read by his creepiness himself, Neil Gaiman, who I must say plays a very menacing tambourine (and who very kindly signed my freshly purchased Batman comic at Dreamhaven yesterday afternoon).

Can you hear me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You sure? I heard that International Authorities were going to disappear me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hadn't heard that, you missed one of the most hilarious comment threads ever. After we &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/pharyngula_fail_tdg_-_science.php"&gt;made light of a pointless poll about the afterlife&lt;/a&gt;, various fans of that site were so horrified that many complaints were launched…and of course, the owner was so deeply committed to free speech that he simply deleted our contribution. One fellow was so indignant that he charged off to the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;amp;t=73754"&gt;Richard Dawkins forums to complain&lt;/a&gt;. He lists his grievances, and, boy, are you readers wicked people. You use rude language, you aren't sufficiently respectful of loony ideas, and when people come here to tell you to shut up if you can't say anything nice, you &lt;i&gt;insult&lt;/i&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I love you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also very evil, because I link to sites with which I disagree, and then you loud, rude, skeptical hooligans go off and laugh at them. This was &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;amp;t=73754&amp;amp;start=25#p1777218"&gt;too much for Jonny-Boy&lt;/a&gt;, who wants us silenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having failed to get this man to accept a single shred of responsibility for dragging his offensive website in the direction of other people who haven't in any way requested its presence, and also for allowing deliberately offensive personal attacks to both appear and remain online in concern of me, I'm now wondering who I should start complaining to?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I've taken snapshots of all the content I've mentioned--including PZ's remarks here--and I'm going to start emailing this stuff out to any relevant ISP's, internet watchdog groups and scientific bodies in the States and Europe. Let's see what other people make of it.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I also think it's intellectually dishonest and harms the atheist cause--both points which I happen to care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped he'd be nice enough to cc this damning letter to me, since I'm sure it would put me in a very jolly mood, but I haven't heard anything yet. The Western Civilization Internet Police haven't dropped in on me yet, either. I'm facing a long afternoon of lab maintenance, the really dreary stuff that isn't exciting at all, so being hauled off to the Hague for fomenting rowdiness on the internet would be an exciting and welcome relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often have you heard the phrase, "harms the cause"? It's getting a bit old; the only time it comes up seems to be when some over-cautious &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=WATB"&gt;WATB&lt;/a&gt; gets worked up over someone who is trying to change the status quo, and especially when anyone actually dares to criticize bourgeois convention in the pursuit of a goal. It's not a phrase I use, but it's as good as donning a uniform for recognizing those timid souls who intend to stand in our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;intellectually dishonest&amp;quot; accusation is a peculiar one. He&amp;#39;s applying it to me because I won&amp;#39;t go into your comments and edit them to remove profanity, harsh accusations, or worst of all, insults directed at Jonny-Boy. I&amp;#39;m not making this up — he actually &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;amp;t=73754&amp;amp;start=125#p1778721"&gt;suggests that I remove all the comments that offend him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that aside, please attend to those offensive comments aimed at me on your site (perhaps do it only as a one-off courtesy if you like) and feel free to replace those unwarranted, derogatory posts with animated pictures of little bunnies skipping around and eating grass--if it makes you feel better. That way you can still kind of rub my nose in the content when it's gone and have another chuckle, only this time fully on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor fellow. He doesn&amp;#39;t understand that free speech means you let people say things which you find disagreeable, and that intellectual honesty doesn&amp;#39;t involve censoring everyone who disagrees with you. He also doesn&amp;#39;t seem to understand me at all — why would I feel good about shredding other people&amp;#39;s comments and replacing them with fluffy bunnies? Why do I need to censor other people&amp;#39;s ideas to laugh at him? Why do I owe him any courtesy at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you see this. You might not. &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;amp;t=73754&amp;amp;start=50#p1777524"&gt;Jonny-Boy has big dreams of deleting the whole site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway we'll see how this turns out. Don't be surprised if you end-up wondering where Pharyngula went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that would be intellectually honest and would help the atheist cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amusing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My take is that you intentionally vandalised my site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Moon was a lovely thin crescent, and Venus shone brilliantly, making them a great target for astrophotos. I took a few dozen shots, but here is my favorite (click to embiggenate):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3315927653/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/3315927653_f189358980.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a three-second exposure I took around 6:15 p.m. local time. I love how you can see the unlit portion of the Moon… unlit by the Sun, that is. The reason you can see it is because it’s being lit by the Earth; in the Moon’s sky the Earth is as much as 50 times brighter than the full Moon. So that lunar landscape is actually reflecting that light back to you, though far dimmer than the sunlit surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also two airplanes in the picture. One is easy, the other is hiding. See them both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see two dark smudges over my roof, too. Those are caused by dust and dirt on the digital detector inside my camera. I tried to clean it out the other day, taking the camera apart into about a dozen pieces, but couldn’t dislodge them. Because they sit on the detector itself, they are wildly out of focus and look like big fuzzy blotches. This happens in astronomical detectors too, and there is a process (called flat fielding) to remove them. However, that’s a lot of effort to undertake and I don’t have the time or energy. I’m not all that gifted with Photoshop (which is obvious if you’re a regular reader here), and I think removing them when the sky brightness has such a large gradient would be tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the lesson here is that point-and-shoot cameras can take lovely photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two more; both taken after the one above (you can see how the Moon and Venus have set a little bit in the intervening time). The one on the left is also a three-second exposure, but taken later when the sky was darker. The one on the right is a 10 second exposure taken even later, but the longer exposure allowed the sky to look brighter. If you look carefully you can even see features on the &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; portion of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3316755204/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3316755204_27092ab372_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a cheap digital camera and a tripod, you can take pictures like this, or even better. I really suggest you try. Orion is up high now right after sunset, and makes a perfect beginner’s target, with lots of bright stars and a very recognizable pattern. Feel free to experiment: long exposures, short ones, different aperture settings, maybe even using a flash to illuminate nearby trees. When I was starting out in high school, I had to use film, which was expensive and took forever to process, so I was conservative when fooling around. Now with digital cameras, taking 40 pictures is as easy as taking one! It just costs time, and you might stumble on an idea that makes your picture really beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go! Take pictures!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235844281111"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/nini-apparently-people-listen/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/096c8dbf9cb6c43f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@nini apparently people listen…</title><published>2009-02-28T17:31:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T17:31:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/nini-apparently-people-listen/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@nini apparently people listen to andrew… oh and re First of May, I read some sec reports about that kind of thing, don’t get arrested &lt;img src="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235844281110"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/not-a-bad-week-got-some-code/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75abf4869291faa6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">not a bad week, got some code …</title><published>2009-02-28T17:28:17Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T17:28:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/not-a-bad-week-got-some-code/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;not a bad week, got some code done, did blog stuff, just 1 meeting, picked potentials programmers, and trac got approved for pm! !mcgill&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235844096210"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-4936330259916647880">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f9b90fa71e67803</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anti-evolutionism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Another reason to drop "Darwinism".</title><published>2009-02-28T16:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T16:45:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/_N619CMUqcI/another-reason-to-drop-darwinism.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=4936330259916647880" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/another-reason-to-drop-darwinism.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">New Scientist book reviews editor Amanda Geftner describes some of the red flags that she has come to recognize as indicating &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126975.800-how-to-spot-a-hidden-religious-agenda.html"&gt;a hidden religious agenda in pseudoscientific books&lt;/a&gt;.  Here is one relevant excerpt:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When you come across the terms "Darwinism" or "Darwinists", take heed. True scientists rarely use these terms, and instead opt for "evolution" and "biologists", respectively. When evolution is described as a "blind, random, undirected process", be warned. While genetic mutations may be random, natural selection is not. When cells are described as "astonishingly complex molecular machines", it is generally by breathless supporters of ID who take the metaphor literally and assume that such a "machine" requires an "engineer". If an author wishes for "academic freedom", it is usually ID code for "the acceptance of creationism".&lt;/blockquote&gt;The usefulness of "Darwinism" as a linguistic marker of anti-evolutionism is another reason for biologists to drop it -- that is, if we don't use it and they also stop using it, we gain because we get a more accurate description of evolution, whereas if we don't use it and they continue to, we gain because it identifies their anti-evolution agendas.   (I already consider it in this manner, but have to make special accommodations for people like Coyne and Dawkins who insist on using it to mean "modern evolutionary biology", or for historians who mean it specifically in terms of Darwin's ideas).&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-4936330259916647880?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/_N619CMUqcI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235842268827"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-63465249">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5f12a25b766244b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skeptics' Circle" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Skeptics Circle</title><published>2009-02-28T16:36:31Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T16:36:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/02/skeptics-circle-1.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/02/skeptics-circle-1.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 106&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Skeptics’ Circle is up at &lt;a href="http://www.disillusionedwords.com/?p=1320"&gt;Disillusioned Words&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235839872338"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/gary_mckinnon_to_be_tried_in_the_us">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2a040bfafe07ed3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Gary McKinnon To Be Tried in the US</title><published>2009-02-28T16:45:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T16:45:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/gary_mckinnon_to_be_tried_in_the_us" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://sarahtitan.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/gary_mckinnon_2.jpg" height="150" alt="Gary McKinnon from http://sarahtitan.files.wordpress.com" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="150"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_case_of_gary_mckinnon"&gt;Gary McKinnon&lt;/a&gt; will be extradited to the US where he could face up to 70 years in a maximum security prison and a $1.75 million fine for allegedly hacking into military computers in the U.S. After the events of 9/11, McKinnon is alleged to have alleged to have hacked his way into 97 computers belonging to NASA, the Department of Defense and several branches of the military. Investigators traced the hacks to the email account of McKinnon's girlfriend in 2002. As reported in &lt;a href="http://www.mxlogic.com/securitynews/network-security/uk-says-no-autistic-hacker-to-be-tried-in-us843.cfm"&gt;MXLogic&lt;/a&gt;, McKinnon had sought to be tried in the UK, where his alleged crimes were less severe. The Crown Prosecution Service has ruled that it would not prosecute him on the alleged charges of computer misuse; a lack of evidence was cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKinnon was &lt;a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/aspergers-added-to-british-hackers-defense/?scp=4&amp;amp;sq=gary%20mckinnon&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2008. The &lt;a href="http://www.nas.org.uk/"&gt;National Autistic Society&lt;/a&gt; and more than 80 MPs supported his request to be tried in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in New Jersey. There are memorials to those who died in 9/11 in my town and many towns. I suspect McKinnon's trial will be duly covered here; any mention of anything related to 9/11, homeland security, cyber terrorism, gets a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

Didn’t you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every ten years the entire Astronomy and Astrophysics community gets together to decide what to do next. We take stock, and plan out the next decade. Committees are formed, white papers are written, town halls are attended, and at the end of a long process a report is issued, with a ranked list of the priorities of the community. This &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010.html"&gt;Decadal Survey&lt;/a&gt; helps decide which telescopes are built and which space missions fly, and sets the direction for the major advances of the field in the coming years. I think this process is fairly unique among academic disciplines; a field self-consciously trying to come up with a formal plan for the future. Of course, it can be quite contentious, but at the end the bulk of the community gets behind what is decided, and everyone goes forward from there. The hope is that this process expresses the will of the community, and therefore will impact which projects are pursued and funded (as opposed to leaving it up to politicians and other non-astronomers). In addition, it’s a chance for everyone to get together and learn what’s happening across the field, and see what directions things are moving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now in the midst of &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010.html"&gt;Astro2010&lt;/a&gt;, the current decadal review. A panel has been formed, chaired by Roger Blandford. A large portion of the astro community was out-of-commission in mid February, as everyone frantically finished up their science white papers.&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/nas.jpg" alt="National Academies logo"&gt; Over &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_SWP_Titles.html"&gt;320 were submitted&lt;/a&gt;, all of which will eventually become public on the NRC website (yours truly contributed to four, having to do with coordinated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations, gamma-ray bursts, and rapid-cadence surveys.). If you’re impatient, you can take a look at a subset of the &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/find/astro-ph/1/OR+co:+2010+co:+Astro2010/0/1/0/all/0/1?per_page=100"&gt;white papers on the arXiv&lt;/a&gt;. The Panel is now &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_Request_for_Input.html"&gt;soliciting white papers&lt;/a&gt; on the State of the Profession and on Technology Development, as well as on specific mission proposals. Anyone is welcome to submit. If you have particularly strong opinions, and feel your voice must be heard, there will also be a series of &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_Town_Halls.html"&gt;Town Hall meetings&lt;/a&gt; over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey should be completed in about a year, with a document summarizing the directions the field is likely to go in for the next decade. The &lt;a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/Astro2010_SWP_Titles.html"&gt;titles of the science white papers&lt;/a&gt; makes for interesting reading in its own right. They show the tremendous breadth of the community, ranging from planets to cosmology, and from magnetic fields to first light.&lt;/p&gt;

Philip Skell regurgitates the theme in a &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/23/evolution-creation-debate-biology-opinions-contributors_darwin.html" rel="external "&gt;recent commentary&lt;/a&gt; in Forbes magazine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Examining the major advances in biological knowledge, one fails to find any real connection between biological history and the experimental designs that have produced today’s cornucopia of knowledge of how the great variety of living organisms perform their functions. It is our knowledge of how these organisms actually operate, not speculations about how they may have arisen millions of years ago, that is essential to doctors, veterinarians, farmers and other practitioners of biological science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The essence of the theory of evolution is the hypothesis that historical diversity is the consequence of natural selection acting on variations. Regardless of the verity it holds for explaining biohistory, it offers no help to the experimenter–who is concerned, for example, with the goal of finding or synthesizing a new antibiotic, or how it can disable a disease-producing organism, what dosages are required and which individuals will not tolerate it. Studying biohistory is, at best, an entertaining distraction from the goals of a working biologist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blogosphere (and probably print media) are replete with summaries and specific cases that show Skell’s assertions to be a crock.  This essay summarizes one such example.  I have chosen this one because it refutes, specifically, the claim that an understanding of the evolutionary history of an organism “offers no help to the experimenter–who is concerned, for example, with the goal of finding or synthesizing a new antibiotic, or how it can disable a disease-producing organism”.  It also ties Skell’s uninformed comments in with another subject that causes ID antievolutionists much consternation - &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/11/is-macroevoluti.html" rel=""&gt;the origins and evolution of organelles&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1990’s, two parallel, seemingly unrelated areas of research came together in a most remarkable way; moreover, they were tied together by explicit evolutionary connections and reasoning.  One field concerned the nature of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexa" rel="external "&gt;Apicomplexa&lt;/a&gt;, a group of protists that includes some of the most serious and problematic of parasites of humans.  For example, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" rel="external "&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a member of this group of organisms.  The Apicomplexa possess (and require for survival) a novel organelle, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicoplast" rel="external "&gt;apicoplast&lt;/a&gt;.  In the ‘90’s, it was discovered that the apicoplast is related to another organelle, the chloroplast.  As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/275/5305/1485" rel="external "&gt;Kohler et al. stated in 1997&lt;/a&gt;:
 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A plastid of probable green algal origin in Apicomplexan parasites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kohler S, Delwiche CF, Denny PW, Tilney LG, Webster P, Wilson RJ, Palmer JD, Roos DS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protozoan parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa contain three genetic elements: the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes characteristic of virtually all eukaryotic cells and a 35-kilobase circular extrachromosomal DNA. In situ hybridization techniques were used to localize the 35-kilobase DNA of Toxoplasma gondii to a discrete organelle surrounded by four membranes. Phylogenetic analysis of the tufA gene encoded by the 35-kilobase genomes of coccidians T. gondii and Eimeria tenella and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum grouped this organellar genome with cyanobacteria and plastids, showing consistent clustering with green algal plastids. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Apicomplexa acquired a plastid by secondary endosymbiosis, probably from a green alga.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, scientists working in a different field were discovering interesting things about chloroplasts, and especially about the unique metabolic capabilities these organelles bring to the plant cell.  Specifically, it was discovered that plastids possess a prokaryotic pathway for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, the precursors of sterols and myriads of secondary metabolites in plants.  This is in addition to the more usual pathway known in humans, a pathway also found in plants.  These pathways are, respectively, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-mevalonate_pathway" rel="external "&gt;non-mevalonate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMG-CoA_reductase_pathway" rel="external "&gt;mevalonate&lt;/a&gt; pathways.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apicoplast, which is needed by the parasite, became an obvious new target for therapies.  This is where the two lines of research summarized in preceding paragraphs came together, linked through decidedly evolutionary reasoning.  Briefly, several groups followed an obvious line of thought - since the parasite has an organelle that is evolutionarily-related to plastids, see if it has plant-like metabolic pathways or other targets that plant (and chloroplast)-specific drugs would act upon.  And indeed, what was found that the Apicomplexa possess a non-MVA pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis, that this pathway is apicoplast-associated, and that drugs that inhibit the non-MVA pathway inhibit the growth of parasites such as P. falciparum.   As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/285/5433/1573" rel="external "&gt;one early report&lt;/a&gt; summarized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inhibitors of the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis as antimalarial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jomaa H, Wiesner J, Sanderbrand S, Altincicek B, Weidemeyer C, Hintz M, Turbachova I, Eberl M, Zeidler J, Lichtenthaler HK, Soldati D, Beck E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institute of Biochemistry, Academic Hospital Centre, Justus-Liebig-University, Friedrichstrasse 24, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.
&lt;a href="mailto:x9KCb8uHrBWNbd2QjPuLad2LYNGMYBTTZ9rKlsSPqBOGY8eQWdTQpdq5W9KCb8uHrBWNbd2QjPuLad2LYNGMYBTTZ9rKlsSPqBOGY8eQWdTQpdo+"&gt;[Enable javascript to see this email address.]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mevalonate-independent pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis present in Plasmodium falciparum was shown to represent an effective target for chemotherapy of malaria. This pathway includes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DOXP) as a key metabolite. The presence of two genes encoding the enzymes DOXP synthase and DOXP reductoisomerase suggests that isoprenoid biosynthesis in P. falciparum depends on the DOXP pathway. This pathway is probably located in the apicoplast. The recombinant P. falciparum DOXP reductoisomerase was inhibited by fosmidomycin and its derivative, FR-900098. Both drugs suppressed the in vitro growth of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum strains. After therapy with these drugs, mice infected with the rodent malaria parasite P. vinckei were cured.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be emphasized that, without the evolutionary connection, people would likely not have thought of looking for non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathways in Plasmodium. This pathway is chloroplast-localized in higher plants and is not known in animals. Without the evolutionary link, there is little chance of pulling this pathway “out of the hat”, as opposed to any of the hundreds of other pathways one has to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstracts I post here are relatively old; readers are encouraged to google terms such as “fosmidomycin” to see how fruitful this avenue of evolutionary reasoning has been.  (They will find that I have omitted other examples of such reasoning; for example, the apicoplast also houses &lt;a href="http://ec.asm.org/cgi/content/full/6/10/1727" rel="external "&gt;a prokaryotic fatty acid synthesizing system&lt;/a&gt;, and drugs that target this are also promising anti-malarials.)  What I hope readers will appreciate is how a decidedly evolutionary line of reasoning has opened the door to a new generation of anti-malarial drugs.  Far from being an arcane and irrelevant plaything of biologists, evolution sits at the very heart of this field of &lt;strong&gt;experimental&lt;/strong&gt; biology and medicine.  Without the evolutionary connection, there would be no links between isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants and malaria (or between prokaryotic fatty acid biosynthesis and malaria, for that matter).  In other words, when ID antievolutionists assert (as Skell does) that evolutionary biology “offers no help to the experimenter–who is concerned, for example, with the goal of finding or synthesizing a new antibiotic, or how it can disable a disease-producing organism”, recall this essay, and think about how badly misinformed Skell and his ilk are. &lt;/p&gt;

His &lt;a href="http://blow.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/bobby-jindal-the-exorcist-pro-or-con/"&gt;dalliance with exorcism gets a write-up in the NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the more depressing questions I've run across is asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That's incredible. But is it politically problematic?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's discouraging that we even need to ask this. A potential presidential candidate believes that a woman grappling with cancer and depression might have been literally possessed by a demon, and that chanting magical incantations cast the demon out. This is absolutely insane stuff. But of course, in this country it's the people who question such ludicrous claims who are regarded as 'close-minded' and 'weird'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discouraging as the fact that that question can even be asked might be, even worse is the answer. "Probably not".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the poll results at that link. 40% of Americans in the 21st century believe that the devil sometimes possesses people. We hoped for flying cars, and all we got was voodoo and speaking in tongues. I feel a little bit cheated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least we can hope that &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; newspapers and television will begin to eye these claims a bit more skeptically. But don't count on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/blood_in_the_water.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/UGeYk5R7Pfc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235837380883"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6046944044238741836">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a6a3e703c30efa1a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science Policy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">United Kingdom Protects Science Budget</title><published>2009-02-28T15:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T16:16:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/united-kingdom-protects-science-budget.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6046944044238741836/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6046944044238741836" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> From NatureNews: Brown pledges to protect science during downturn.

That post is still making its way around the entire internet (the entirenet? is that catchy? no? nevermind then.) Seriously, I had no idea how many people cared so deeply about the topic. It’s received an unprecidented amount of traffic.  I was sure the Scientologists were going to come after me, but no such luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But almost as fun as being murdered by Tom Cruise was an email we received a couple of weeks ago from someone who liked the article, but not my writing style. She said she “wasn’t offended”, but felt that my frequent use of the word “dick” demonstrated a double standard since no one at Skepchick throws the word “cunt” around in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email in its entirety, more dick, and my reply after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Suggestion:  if you are offended by the discussion of comparative obscenity, you should &lt;a href="http://www.cuteoverload.com/2009/02/bunny.html"&gt;[read more here]&lt;/a&gt; instead of after the jump.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name: Jane Q. Public&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email: jqpxxx@xxxxxx.xxx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: News Item or  Link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message: I am writing about Elyse’s article “Buy ShamWows!  Now!”&lt;br&gt;
(January 19, 2009, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/?p=5490"&gt;http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5490&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  found the article to be fascinating. But I take exception to&lt;br&gt;
Elyse’s frequent  use of the word “dick”. Don’t misunderstand me, I am&lt;br&gt;
not “offended”! But I  think it is unprofessional and it reflects a&lt;br&gt;
double standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we  know, men tend to be offended less easily. But if the word&lt;br&gt;
“dick” is okay,  then there really is no reason that the word “cunt”&lt;br&gt;
should not also be okay.  However, I do not see ANYBODY going around&lt;br&gt;
calling other people “cunthole”.  There must be some reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less double-standard, please. Then your  articles will carry more&lt;br&gt;
credibility. People know the authors are female from  the name of the&lt;br&gt;
site. It is not necessary to pound that home with a  sharpened&lt;br&gt;
sledgehammer. Doing so makes you appear to be pissed off  and&lt;br&gt;
defensive, rather than objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, keep up the  good work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that Jane Q. Public is not “offended”, but rather is merely put off by my need to pound my gender home with a sharpened sledge hammer. I also understand that she thinks the girls at Skepchick should stop picking on the boys just because they’re tougher than us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that the reason we can throw the word “dick” around so freely and not “cunt” has nothing to do with each gender’s relative skin thickness. It has to do with what the words mean in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i76.photobucket.com/albums/j5/time411brian/i-think-youre-a-cunt-sm.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="181"&gt;The word “dick” is only similar to the word “cunt” in that they are both slang for those body parts generally reserved for significant others, Catholic priests and Skepchick calendars. They are also the kind of names that get your mouth washed out if you use them to describe your sibling when your grandmother is in earshot. But as an insult, they do not carry equal weight. And as degrading references to gender, they are even less equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep score here. Dick is an insult. It is aimed generally at men, and refers to a penis. Cunt is an insult. It is aimed generally at women and refers to a vagina. On that comparison, no &lt;strong&gt;Sexist Degradation Points&lt;/strong&gt; awarded to either term. Cunt: 0, Dick:0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick, while generally applied to men, can be used in gender neutral situations. If you don’t know the gender of the person in front of you, who is driving like an asshole, you might call that person a dick. The term “cunt” is reserved for once you’ve seen that driver, and that driver is, undoubtedly, female.  &lt;strong&gt;Sexist Degradation Points:&lt;/strong&gt; Cunt +1, Dick 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunt and dick are both used to communicate that the insultee is unpleasant or unlikable, a person you would likely prefer to avoid if given the option. But the word cunt is closely related to the word “bitch”; both words almost exclusively used to describe women. Dick is mostly used when describing men, but not with the same exclusivity. You only call a man a cunt if you are being ironic or campy.  &lt;strong&gt;SDP&lt;/strong&gt;: Cunt +1, Dick 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to call you a dick, I would not be saying that you are acting in a manner consistent with possessing male genitalia in your Dockers. Cunt and pussy mean exactly that, but female rather than male. If I call you a “pussy” I’m saying that you are physically weak or emotionally soft like a girl. You are not strong and manly. You possess traits that are undesirable and therefore you are acting like a woman; you are acting like a vagina. Cunt, on the other hand, does not mean that you are weak and womanly, it means that you are  unpleasant and bitchy. You are like a woman who is having her period, a ball of hormonal rage… a bloody cunt. &lt;strong&gt;SDP&lt;/strong&gt;: Cunt +2, Dick 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these two words to be sexist equals, you have to be able to swap them out in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I say, “Rebecca, you are acting like such a cunt today.” Do I mean, &lt;em&gt;You are acting like your girly genitals are doing all of your talking today, and you’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;seriously pissing people off&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is exactly what I mean.* I mean that a man in her situation would handle it completely differently. He wouldn’t get his panties in a wad. He wouldn’t have to act like a controlling bitch to get the job done.&lt;a href="http://codepoetics.com/poetix/?p=834"&gt;&lt;img src="http://codepoetics.com/poetix/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dick.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="275"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I say, “Sam, you are acting like such  a dick today.” Do I mean, &lt;em&gt;You are acting like your manly genitals are controlling your actions today, and you’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;seriously pissing people off&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, not at all. I am saying that he’s being a jerk.**  If anything, I’m saying that by virtue of his penis, at least his jerkiness is not him acting like a pussy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDP&lt;/strong&gt;: Cunt: +1, Dick -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cunt is arguably the worst insult you can hurl at a woman. You could call her a bitch, but that’s not enough… what’s a step beyond bitch? Cunt. What’s worse than cunt? Fucking cunt? Goddamn cunt? Goddamn fucking cunt? After cunt, it’s just a matter of qualifying her amount of cuntiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a word that is generally reserved, even by those of us who are unabashedly profane, for the worst situations. It is more than a word. It is a statement. You are not saying that this woman is just unpleasant, but that she embodies everything that is evil and wrong with women. It’s the word people use when they can’t come up with the words to articulate how much they hate a woman. Calling a woman a cunt is the equivalent of calling a black man a nigger or a gay man a faggot. But you really can’t throw around words like nigger and faggot without coming across as an ignorant hick. But with the right delivery, cunt makes a profound statement about the person being described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is dick the worst thing you can call a man? Is it any worse than asshole? Is asshole the worst thing you can call a man? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example - last night, I was watching the documentary &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Dear_Zachary_A_Letter_to_a_Son_About_His_Father/70095159"&gt;Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son about his Father&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about a boy, Zachary, whose mother found out she was pregnant with him shortly after she killed his father. At one point, Zachary’s grandfather calls the woman a cunt, or maybe a fucking cunt either way, it really works. It tells you exactly what he thinks of her. A woman murders your only son, she’s a fucking cunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You murdered my family, you… you… you cunt!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s flip it. Let’s say it was a man who murdered their only daughter. Can you really call him a dick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You murdered my family, you… you… you dick!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://suburbanpanic.com/2008/09/12/nsfw-comics-for-nsfw-times/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://suburbanpanic.com/comics/2008-09-12_comparative_junk.png" alt="" width="216" height="547"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It only works if it’s the first time you’ve ever used profanity. Otherwise it sounds like you’re trying to parody South Park’s famed “You killed Kenny”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick is more appropriate for the following exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy 1: You ate all my PopTarts, you dick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guy2: Geez, I’ll buy you another box. No need to be such a dick about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl1: You ate all my PopTarts, you cunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Girl2: Geez, I’ll buy you another box, No need to be a cunt about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? The second one is actually pretty funny to me because the exchange is so bizarre. &lt;strong&gt;SDP&lt;/strong&gt;: Cunt +10, Dick +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://suburbanpanic.com/2008/09/12/nsfw-comics-for-nsfw-times/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and add up the points yourself.  I don’t think a total is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flippantly using the word dick, I will concede, isn’t professional - but neither is posing topless for the Skepchick calendar. But, you may be surprised to hear, I am not a professional journalist. Hell, unless you count Wii Sports Boxing, I’m not a professional anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for treating men unfairly by using the word dick? C’mon. It’s a nice sentiment that the sexes are equal, our genitals are equal, and that insulting one gender is insulting everyone; but it’s not the reality. Until “dick” is used with the same hatred and venom that “cunt” is, I will continue to use it. Likewise, once Jon Stewart starts throwing around “cunt” nightly in lighthearted commentary without backlash, I will use it, too.  Because that’s fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I won’t use “boob” as an insult. That sounds like something an old and creepy guy would say. And besides, what’s better than boobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://suburbanpanic.com/2008/09/12/nsfw-comics-for-nsfw-times/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;*That is exactly what I mean in this &lt;em&gt;completely hypothetical&lt;/em&gt; statement. IRL, I totally heart Rebecca.  She pays us in  love and candied unicorn poop, and we adore her for it.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;**If his manly genitals were controlling him, he’d either be peeing on everything or having sex with everyone he saw… that’s generally not referred to as “being a dick”, but rather “I’m calling security. You’re fired.”&lt;/h6&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235835301033"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1191">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8889e2114167458</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the media"/><title type="html">Imperial BS flows?</title><published>2009-02-28T14:46:11Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T14:46:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1191" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Does the network of journalistic credulousness still follow the connections established during the glory days of the British empire? I'm not sure how else to explain the diffusion pattern of Mark Pagel's little jokes about his estimates of cognate-replacement rates in language change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my post a couple of days ago ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1186"&gt;Scrabble tips for time travelers&lt;/a&gt;"), I linked to a calvalcade of foolishness that included coverage in the Times ("&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5805522.ece"&gt;A handy little guide to small talk in the Stone Age&lt;/a&gt;"), the BBC ("&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7911645.stm"&gt;Oldest English words' identified&lt;/a&gt;"), the Guardian ("&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/26/language-evolution-words-extinction-dirty"&gt;Word facing extinction: 'Dirty' will be scrubbed from the English dictionary&lt;/a&gt;"), and the Daily Mail ("&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1156122/Revealed-The-worlds-oldest-words--ones-disappear.html"&gt;Revealed: The world&amp;#39;s oldest words… and the ones that will disappear&lt;/a&gt;"). And a Google News search yields a cornucopia of other giddy idiocies in British-empire media.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There's the Globe and Mail ("&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090227.WORDS27/TPStory/National"&gt;No surprise: 'I' is our oldest word&lt;/a&gt;"), the Scotsman ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-admin/http%3A%2F%2Fnews.scotsman.com%2Fuk%2FThree-is-first-among-equals.5022615.jp"&gt;Three is first among equals in oldest words in English&lt;/a&gt;"), the Times of India ("&lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/I-we-two-Oldest-words-in-English/articleshow/4198133.cms"&gt;I, we, two: Oldest words in English&lt;/a&gt;"), Pakistan's The Nation ("&lt;a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Entertainment/27-Feb-2009/Oldest-English-words-identified"&gt;Oldest English words identified&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite is the Daily Express ("The World's Greatest Newspaper"), whose &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/86599/Doctor-Who-s-handy-new-phrasebook-"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; rises to a level of delirious fatuity that only a picture of the page can do justice to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ExpressWho.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ExpressWho.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only non-British-Empire outlet to run a version of the story, as far as I've been able to discover, is Agence France Presse, perhaps because the English did conquer parts of France at one time: "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gvnWrwvXJwzV6b7Quyz0ncYvSerA"&gt;British scientists uncover oldest words in English&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two days after the press release, two days after the stories in the Times and BBC News, two days after a prominent segment on the BBC News Hour (widely broadcast by public radio stations in the U.S.) not a single U.S. outlet has picked this up. Not the New York Times, not the Washington Post, not the Baltimore Sun, not the Deseret News, not even the National Inquirer. Now, there's ample evidence that American news media are not immune to bullshit. So I guess that this is telling us that information in the modern world still flows along lines laid down a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in the preceding paragraph, I've used the word "bullshit" in its technical sense, following the &lt;a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html"&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; proposed by Harry Frankfurt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;What bullshit essentially misrepresents is neither the state of affairs to which it refers nor the beliefs of the speaker concerning that state of affairs. Those are what lies misrepresent, by virtue of being false. Since bullshit need not be false, it differs from lies in its misrepresentational intent. The bullshitter may not deceive us, or even intend to do so, either about the facts or about what he takes the facts to be. What he does necessarily attempt to deceive us about is his enterprise. His only indispensably distinctive characteristic is that in a certain way he misrepresents what he is up to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; This is the crux of the distinction between him and the liar. Both he and the liar represent themselves falsely as endeavoring to communicate the truth. The success of each depends upon deceiving us about that. But the fact about himself that the liar hides is that he is attempting to lead us away from a correct apprehension of reality; we are not to know that he wants us to believe something he supposes to be false. The fact about himself that the bullshitter hides, on the other hand, is that the truth-values of his statements are of no central interest to him; what we are not to understand is that his intention is neither to report the truth nor to conceal it. This does not mean that his speech is anarchically impulsive, but that the motive guiding and controlling it is unconcerned with how the things about which he speaks truly are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I still hold out some hope that Prof. Pagel is being systematically misquoted, I'm afraid that I'm now reluctantly coming to believe what a colleague of his told me in confidence: "He knows better, but he just doesn't care".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skiing Break was action packed for the kids. Monday museum, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/with_juniorette_at_the_playlan.php"&gt;Tuesday playland&lt;/a&gt;, Wednesday skiing with grampa, Thursday swimming, Friday museum &amp;amp; puppet theatre and a museum-organised LAN party for the 10-y-o.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's museum was the &lt;a href="http://www.sl.se/Templates/SubStart.aspx?id=3204"&gt;Public Transport Museum&lt;/a&gt; which shares an entrance and a ticket with the Toy Museum. Lots of buses and trams, including one bus standing on a service pit where you can descend and check out the under side of the vehicle. Juniorette and I made a pink train carriage in the children's workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that caught my eye was a mothballed experimental hybrid bus, part of a long-running project to improve the environmental footprint of the city's public transport. It has a car engine running at constant RPM, which charges a large battery, which in turn drives an electrical engine, which drives the bus. Among its strengths is an ability to drive silently in sensitive areas. Among its weaknesses: a 110% fuel consumption compared to a normal diesel engine. Back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a signpost, the fuel-guzzling hybrid is just one of a series of designs that have fallen by the road side during the project. The best solution so far has turned out to be ethanol buses, which are quite common, unmistakable with their smell of old drunk. But as everybody knows by now, ethanol is a useless replacement for fossil fuels as its production uses up loads of them. So it seems that the Stockholm program has yet to find even one working solution. Good to know that they're trying, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, we may see buses running on methane from the Henriksdal sewage plant. It's inside a mountain that my commuter train passes through every day, and the housing area on its top (once the site of a 1st Millennium hillfort) is colloquially known as the Toilet Lid.

They are usually based upon the religious myths each culture accepts. There is no morality then, only "moralities."&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He finds that there are moralities among animals like Chimps, so it shouldn't surprise us when language bearing humans came up with more elaborate moral rules. And since we're talking about human beings, it's no surprise that our moralities have some major similarities since we are social animals who need to get along, to be loved and to love, to help and to be helped. Anyone who doesn't accept the moral rules of a culture are not allowed in the group, or we banish them, ostracize them, imprison them, and kill them. Do you want the benefits of being in the group? Then obey the moral rules, or at least don't get caught. Otherwise, you’re on your own. As such, there is nothing prohibiting someone from not accepting the moral rules of a culture if s/he doesn't want the benefits of the group (which would be a Freudian "death wish"). Are acts like murder, rape, and theft objectively and universally "wrong" then? That's probably a nonsensical question. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, there can be no argument for the existence of God based on morality. Human beings make up their own moralities because we're social beings who need to belong and get along. &lt;strong&gt;Morality is part of our survival instinct. We need other people to survive!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;For a Christian who might be stunned by the conclusion that it's probably a nonsensical question whether or not murder, rape, and theft are objectively and universally "wrong," then think again. Look at your own Bible. There is plenty of that to be found in it, all sanctioned by your barbaric God. Elsewhere I've argued that &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/06/atheistic-ethic_13.html"&gt;rational self-interest&lt;/a&gt; can account for our morality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the molecule, an antibody known as CR6261, is good news for researchers who hope to design a flu vaccine that would give humans lifelong protection against a majority of influenza viruses. The antibody also has the potential to treat those who are unvaccinated and become infected with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we can expect the conspiracy nuts to insist this is part of an evil plot by the New World Order to wipe out 90% of all life on earth or some crap like that.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, it's the last day of February, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;spring is coming&lt;/a&gt;, and it just occurred to me........high time to start thinking about summer programming. Charlie does have Extended School Year provided by the school district for six weeks. It's just in the morning, which is both a good thing (it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; summer, and a desire to be lazy and looser appeals) and a potential harbinger of fretfulness, and not only in me but in Charlie, whose preference (need) for routine, order, and the reassurance generated by these has been greater than ever. (That &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; thing again---really, it's starting to seem that adolescence is the be-all and end-all of Charlie's woes these days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESY for Charlie starts at 9am (good---our household seems ever on the verge of being done in with the need to meet the bus by 7.30am) and ends at 1pm.  So he's got the better part of the afternoon off. Jim (with the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;magnum opus&lt;/a&gt; done) is contemplating a summer of outdoor "Dad 'n' Son" time; Charlie and I have filled the days with walks, swimming, and random trips to here and there (there's often a trip to Target on hot thundercloudy days when there is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; left to do). I am contemplating having Charlie attend camp at our YMCA, with kids his age. Often in our days swimming there in the summer, we've seen campers lining up to use the pool slide. It can be pretty chaotic---Charlie is going to need an aide, regardless, and we may only have him attend the camp for an abbreviated period of time, at least to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aide would have to be provided (found and trained and paid) by us; I do think the experience would be very worth it. Summer has always been a bit of a scramble for us and we're not alone among families: &lt;a href="http://www.whptv.com/news/local/story/Program-cut/iU-2y36LWE6GJXhrHBlj4g.cspx"&gt;CBS21&lt;/a&gt; (Pennsylvania) reported yesterday about the effects faced by more than 800 children and their families due to cuts in the &lt;a href="http://www.childrenshomeofrdg.org/stap.html"&gt;Summer Therapeutic Activities Program&lt;/a&gt;, or STAP. In previous years, STAP has run for nine weeks; it's being shortened to five weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cabhc.org/"&gt;Capital Behavioral Health Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; oversees STAP, and covers Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, and Perry Counties. Over the last two years, the counties have lost 14-million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the state only requires counties to provide 5 weeks of STAP, CBHC decided to make the cuts there.  STAP offers hundreds of kids in our area a chance to play games, enjoy physical activities, even field trips once a week. And it keeps them involved at a level that is crucial for their emotional, behavioral, and educational progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are worried all of that will fall away with the shortened program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those skills that you worked on the last school year will regress - and some of them disappear in a three month time period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know budgets have been frozen in our school district and am just hoping that the student-to-teacher will remain the same.  Elsewhere----in &lt;a href="http://www.hometownlife.com/article/20090227/NEWS16/90227005"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt; in Michigan, to cite one place---a "serious shortfall in money" is threatening a county-wide program for special education students. It's always a jaw-dropping moment for me at an end of the school year IEP meeting to hear a case manager say "well, in summer, we are just trying to maintain skills; summer is not the time to acquire new ones."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who says learning is supposed to get put on hold just because it's summer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer can be a make-or-break-time---and most everyone thinking that summer = relaxation and fun makes it all the harder. So I'm glad I've started worrying now, and planning. And budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235812067849"><id gr:original-id="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/?p=416">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2d07844757426a24</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="breast"/><category term="cock"/><category term="euphemism"/><category term="fuck"/><category term="John Edward"/><category term="language"/><category term="masturbate"/><category term="penis"/><category term="sex"/><category term="Skeptic"/><category term="Steven Pinker"/><category term="taboo"/><title type="html">“Skeptics are not cynics!” Biggles ejaculated.</title><published>2009-02-28T09:03:37Z</published><updated>2009-02-28T09:03:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/skeptics-are-not-cynics-biggles-ejaculated/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="KY jelly" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/ky-jelly-4.jpg?w=127&amp;amp;h=210" alt="KY jelly" width="127" height="210"&gt;KY&lt;/strong&gt; is known to Americans as a two-letter &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_postal_abbreviations#Postal_abbreviations"&gt;state abbreviation for Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, but in Australia, where there are comparatively fewer state abbreviations (and some are three-letters), people almost invariably link &lt;em&gt;KY&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/strong&gt; product &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Y_Jelly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KY Jelly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; an, um, err…”personal lubricant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently made the mistake of referring to “KY” to colleagues,  in good, clean context, but this received several smutty schoolboy replies.  Perhaps I knew this could cause confusion, or at least correlation. Do we have dirty minds, or is there something else at work here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we all know that I have a dirty mind, and that you do too, dear reader.  But that’s beside the point as to why I say  “cock” and you think of “male genitalia” before you think of a “rooster”; and why I say “masticate”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and you think “masturbate”; and I say “lubricate” and you think of your favorite “orifice”, rather than “valves and pipes” (and why you think of an orifice when I say “valves and pipes”? Is there any end to your filth?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cor. Get out the whiskey and let’s continue. You need a stiffner for this one… (shut up!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several co-occurring cogntive-linguistic elements at work here involving &lt;strong&gt;taboo&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;semantic structure&lt;/strong&gt;. No, don’t go yet. Think about the following sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  &lt;em&gt;Do you want the breast or the leg?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Australia was once a penal colony.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. You have a beautiful cock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put it to you that the words &lt;em&gt;breast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;leg&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;penal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cock&lt;/em&gt; stood out, and even though you know these can be innocuous, non-sexual sentences, these words have either made you feel embarrassed, or perhaps even a little aroused, but definitely titillated (…sorry for that last one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…Now, let’s look at these examples a little more intimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. “Do you want the breast or the leg?” By context you would assume the topic is &lt;strong&gt;chicken&lt;/strong&gt;, and “breast” would normally form part of the slightly more comfortable phrase “chicken breast”. “Breast” is curious in this singular form though, and “leg” might not even get a look in as a dirty word unless it’s coupled with another anatomical word.  I bet you’re probably thinking of the phrases “I’m a breast man” and “I’m a leg man”. You’re probably wondering why I didn’t also say “thigh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, chickens cause many linguistic problems. I once ordered a “stuffed chicken” and was told the more polite form is “seasoned chicken”.  Technically, it’s fucking stuffed, but deli staff have delicate sensibilities – even if they do force spices up a dead chicken’s ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another example, “I’m really wet”. Was I caught out in the rain? Am I sweaty, or did I just shower? Paralinguistic factors (pitch, volume) would assist in deciphering the textual ambiguity here, but I can guess what you’re thinking. &lt;em&gt;Wet&lt;/em&gt; is innocuous in “The car is wet” but with a human subject (esp. female), the connotations heat up.  These are examples of semantic &lt;strong&gt;generality&lt;/strong&gt; – where one word has multiple related meanings (like a &lt;em&gt;chip&lt;/em&gt; of wood, or a potato &lt;em&gt;chip&lt;/em&gt;). Here, the naughty meaning usually wins out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;leg&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;wet&lt;/em&gt; are often innocuous in context and especially in fixed phrases, but in isolation, it’s like a word association test where every word has you responding with “sex!” Think &lt;em&gt;throb&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;passage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stool&lt;/em&gt; – where would British comedy be without such double entendres?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  “Australia was once a penal colony.” I said this to a trolley driver in SoCal once.  He, like you, thought I said “penis”.  Why did this happen? Because &lt;em&gt;penal&lt;/em&gt; is phonologically similar to (sounds like) &lt;em&gt;penis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;penile&lt;/em&gt;.  This is why “masticate” will probably make you think of “masturbate”. I once teased a fellow in a supermarket with, “Excuse me, where are the condiments?” Of course, &lt;em&gt;condiments&lt;/em&gt; sounds like “condoms”, and this is where the poor red-faced fellow directed me to – aisle 4, right next to the KY jelly, rather than aisle 8 with the Vegemite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon also occurs in the title of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drwaynedyer.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr Wayne W Dyer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;/em&gt;book&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Erroneous-Zones/dp/B0015KGWZG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Erroneous Zones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Eyebrows will be raised if you read this book on a bus. People confuse “erroneous” with “errogenous”, especially when &lt;em&gt;erroneous&lt;/em&gt; is followed by “zone”, which makes you think of “that spot” on your neck, or elsewhere…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="Fuck it, I&amp;#39;ll go!" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/phuket3.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=149" alt="Fuck it, I&amp;#39;ll go!" width="300" height="149"&gt;Penal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;condiment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;masticate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;sound like&lt;/strong&gt; taboo terms, and therefore, they &lt;strong&gt;become&lt;/strong&gt; taboo by association. They are stigmatized in the same way as &lt;em&gt;penis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;condom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;masturbate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of &lt;strong&gt;pejoration&lt;/strong&gt; (a word that develops negative connotations) by association can relegate an innocent word to obsolescene. That’s why some of these words sound so archaic, they’ve been spanked so hard they aren’t used much anymore. As an historical example, the word &lt;em&gt;coney&lt;/em&gt; (meaning “rabbit”) disappeared from usage due to its phonological similarity to &lt;em&gt;cunt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the photo examples that capitalize on the &lt;strong&gt;homophonic&lt;/strong&gt; (audial) similarity of “Phuket” (poo-ket) to &lt;em&gt;fuck it &lt;/em&gt;- and &lt;img title="you are sofa king good in bed..." src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/sofa-king1.jpeg?w=240&amp;amp;h=117" alt="you are sofa king good in bed..." width="240" height="117"&gt;“Sofa King” to &lt;em&gt;so fucking&lt;/em&gt;. This is why we laugh at the name &lt;strong&gt;Fanny&lt;/strong&gt;, and make stupid jokes about &lt;strong&gt;Uranus&lt;/strong&gt;.  The &lt;strong&gt;French Connection&lt;/strong&gt; brand of clothing do something similar with their &lt;strong&gt;FCUK&lt;/strong&gt; label, a transposition of letters that bears a structural resemblance to FUCK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a word looks exactly the same as a taboo word, and it is so tainted that the variant usage shrivels up altogether, like a flaccid…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="a beautiful cock" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/cock1.jpg?w=151&amp;amp;h=210" alt="a beautiful cock" width="151" height="210"&gt;3. “You have a beautiful cock”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words with the same form but completely different meanings are &lt;strong&gt;polysemous&lt;/strong&gt; (like a &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; person versus a &lt;em&gt;kind/type&lt;/em&gt; of person). Polysemy of a taboo word can result in the death of the non-taboo variant. For example, &lt;em&gt;cock&lt;/em&gt; is rarely used to mean “rooster”, and often for humorous purposes only. &lt;em&gt;Ass&lt;/em&gt; is rarely used for “donkey”. &lt;em&gt;Pussy&lt;/em&gt; for “cat” is going this same way too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rude sense becomes the most salient sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why “ejaculate” only appears in pre-World War II &lt;a href="http://www.biggles.info/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.enidblyton.net/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enid Blyton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; novels.  Over time, ejaculate=exclaim gave way to ejaculate=orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taboo ‘dispreferred’ meanings are almost invariably preferred usages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad or naughty or adverse connotations are often the ones to fight and survive. Think of &lt;em&gt;drink&lt;/em&gt; – it is becoming more associated with ‘alcoholic drink’ in usage today. Think of &lt;em&gt;abuse&lt;/em&gt; – it is more associated with ’sexual abuse’ than ‘verbal abuse’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words like &lt;em&gt;niggardly&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;denigrate&lt;/em&gt; are dying, as a result of their structural similarity to the n-word. It’s a semantic crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words aren’t &lt;strong&gt;cognates&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., related etymologically, in origin) but we blame them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look like John Edward you’ll be mistaken for &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; John Edward, and &lt;em&gt;treated&lt;/em&gt; like him…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the word &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; is riddled with negative connotations and  stereotypes. I don’t care how many of you argue that ’skeptics aren’t cynics’.  Clearly, if we look at language use (reality, folks – how people really think and how people really speak) &lt;em&gt;skeptic &lt;/em&gt;has polysemy – multiple co-existing senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; is a ‘conspiracy theorist’ to many. A &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; is a ‘cynic’ to many. A &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; is a ‘nasty, naysaying, doubting curmudgeon’ to many. And a &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; is ‘a person who thinks critically about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims’ to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which senses are winning out? The ones with negative connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Face it – &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; is sort of like &lt;em&gt;cock&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stool&lt;/em&gt; – but even more like &lt;em&gt;drink&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;abuse&lt;/em&gt;. There are senses of &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt; with negative connotations that are competing for saliency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t advocate that we replace &lt;em&gt;skeptic&lt;/em&gt;, especially with a poncy word like &lt;em&gt;bright&lt;/em&gt; – this can only open us up to &lt;strong&gt;Steven Pinker’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.euphemisms.org/#The_.E2.80.9CEuphemism_Treadmill.E2.80.9D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;euphemism treadmill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where a word or concept is so stigmatized that replacement words are inevitably stigmatised (think &lt;em&gt;handicapped&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is,  wear your &lt;strong&gt;skeptic&lt;/strong&gt; label with pride – promote useful, practical and healthy skepticism, and be a good example of a skeptic.  We skeptics need to reclaim skepticism, and become the salient sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s become known as being funny, smart and caring – rather than cocks, asses and stools.&lt;/p&gt;

How serious is measles?
Very. The Lay Science blog has covered this topic here. The post includes details of recent outbreaks of measles:
Italy, 2002: 4 deaths, 594 hospitalizations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest consumer, Utah, averaged 5.47 adult content subscriptions per 1000 home broadband users; Montana bought the least with 1.92 per 1000. “The differences here are not so stark,” Edelman says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the top 10 pornography consuming states gave their electoral votes to John McCain in last year’s presidential election - Florida and Hawaii were the exceptions. While six out of the lowest 10 favoured Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially that means those states that are most populated by deeply religious people are also the states that consume the most porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;States where a majority of residents agreed with the statement “I have old-fashioned values about family and marriage,” bought 3.6 more subscriptions per thousand people than states where a majority disagreed. A similar difference emerged for the statement “AIDS might be God’s punishment for immoral sexual behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family values, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No really, take a guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, he belongs to the Republican Party? I know what you’re thinking. The Republican Party supports this anti-science lunatic? I’m as shocked as you are. [rolling eyes]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats were outraged Wednesday morning when Republican state Sen. Dave Schultheis said he planned to vote against a bill to require HIV tests for pregnant women because the disease “stems from sexual promiscuity” and he didn’t think the Legislature should “remove the negative consequences that take place from poor behavior and unacceptable behavior.” The Colorado Springs lawmaker then proceeded to cast the lone vote against SB-179, which passed 32-1 and moves on to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for those who might think that I’m giving the Jewish religion a pass, this bulletin’s for you. &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/sinful-city-buses-stoned-by-ultra-orthodox-jews-1631370.html"&gt;Ultra-Orthodox Jews are stoning Israeli buses&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, nobody told them that you can’t kill a bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violence is part of an unholy war in which strident elements of the ultra-Orthodox community in Mea Shearim are trying to force Israel’s leading bus company – and, by extension, Israeli society – to defer to their strict religious teachings and sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Israel defines itself as a Jewish state, what that means in practice is subject to dispute, with religious and secular Jews constantly tugging for greater clout in shaping the character of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So why are the futile attempt to stone the bus to death? Oh, this is where it gets good. These nutjobs are pissed off that the buses are co-ed. Remember that silly passage in The Bible about not sitting where a menstruating woman once sat? These guys actually take that seriously and think that women and men should enter and exit the bus from different doors and should have segregated seating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And it gets better. Take a guess what part of the bus they think the women should sit. No really, guess. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah, that’s right. They demand that women sit in the back of the bus. Let me just write that out again. They demand that women SIT IN THE BACK OF THE BUS! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the view of some ultra-Orthodox Jews, segregated seating, with women entering separately through the rear door and sitting at the back, is vital to uphold their stringent traditions stipulating modesty and prohibiting physical contact with members of the opposite sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know, to avoid cuties. I think we need to loan out Rosa Parks to those nations in need.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He makes critical analysis of evolution item (a) and moves all the other items down one letter.  The old (a) becomes (b) and so forth. Evolution is evidently the only topic requiring critical analysis. Coincidentally “critical analysis” is code for “teach creationism”.  It didn’t work in Ohio once the trick was discovered, but hope springs eternal.  By another coincidence Senator Wise recently wanted to &lt;a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=920" rel="external "&gt;teach ID&lt;/a&gt;, another code word for creationism.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wise’s bill has already been covered by &lt;a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=925" rel="external "&gt;Florida Citizens for Science&lt;/a&gt; (read the &lt;a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=926" rel="external "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; as well) and by &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/02/antievolution-legislation-florida-004627" rel="external "&gt;NCSE&lt;/a&gt;.  For additional background see Wesley’s &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/04/florida-open-le.html" rel=""&gt;Open Letter&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the bill make it out of committee?  If it does, then what? If it passes both houses and is signed into law, then of course creationists declare victory and start teaching their usual stuff.  Meanwhile, “It’s not about creationism, no siree. Why, the word isn’t even mentioned.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of some questions in the comments, here is more explanation of why the bill is automatically thought to be an invitation to teach creationism.  Whenever certain keywords such as “critical analysis of evolution” are used, creationists have so interpreted those words repeatedly in the recent past.  Read &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/11/sex-lies-and-a.html" rel=""&gt;sex, lies and a math mistake&lt;/a&gt; for several cases. As the state of Ohio learned in detail, the phrase “critical analysis” is used to mean a large dose of creationist claims.  These claims are known to be wrong, and they readily mislead the neophyte. They amount to propaganda against biology.  As the &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/01/ohio-fordham-ev-1.html" rel=""&gt;Fordham science standards evaluators&lt;/a&gt; said of Ohio’s mistake in letting these words be slipped into their standards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But the benefit of doubt we gave the benchmark may have been a mistake. Creationism-inspired “critical analysis” of evolutionary biology - as has been shown over and over again in the scientific literature, and recently in a Pennsylvania Federal Court - is neither serious criticism nor serious analysis. The newest version of creationism, so-called Intelligent Design (ID) theory, is no exception. Like its predecessors, it is neither critical nor analytic, nor has it made any contribution to the literature of science. Any suggestion that our “B” grade for Ohio’s standards endorses sham critiques of evolution, as offered by creationists, is false.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Senator Wise is innocent of the charge that he wants to introduce creationism into public school science classes, all he has to do is spell out the content he has in mind. As long as he insists “Pass a law to teach this slogan, we will worry about the details later” there is every reason to suspect him of deliberately opening the door to creationism.  And even if that is not his intent, recent history makes it clear that creationists will so interpret his wording. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So please welcome Tim Kreider to the stable. Tim is an MD/PhD student at a public university in the northeast US. He never paid much mind to pseudoscience until discovering &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; and other podcasts that now keep him company during long nights in lab. He practices his skeptical analysis on extracurricular lectures organized by a student interest group for integrative medicine on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Tim is investigating immune mechanisms in a mouse model of gastrointestinal helminth infection. As a medical student, he has no idea what specialty to pursue and would love advice. He loves to teach math and science and hopes to pursue a career in medical academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re very happy to have Tim on board. Given that one of my concerns is the infiltration of pseudoscience into the medical school curriculum, I consider it essential to have a medical student on board to give that perspective. Because of his academic load, Tim will be blogging only once a month, although I do hope to tease a little more out of him, as long as it doesn’t jeopardize his education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;James Randi talks about one of the most influential scientists of all time; Carl Sagan. Randi and Sagan were well acquainted, and Sagan once said of Randi: "We may not always agree with Randi, but we ignore him at our peril."

XVIII. 63 - 4) is claimed to have written. The full lecture, from which these sections were taken by Louis Feldman, can be found&lt;a href="http://www.tzemachdovid.org/israel/feldman.shtml"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Louis Feldman:&lt;br&gt;As Eli Wiesel has said, the world is willing to forget the slaughter of six million innocent Jews sixty years ago, but it will never let the Jews forget the execution of that one Jew two thousand years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the fact that it depends upon the Gospels immediately raises a number of questions. Because, after all, when you say the Gospels, there are four different accounts in the Gospels and they don't agree with one another in a number of respects. For example, there are different genealogies of Jesus. They have different accounts of the trial of Jesus. And we'll see there are other discrepancies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to those four accounts, there are a number of accounts that never made it into the canon of the New Testament. So therefore to speak of something that will be dependent upon the Gospels, which Gospel?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, how could you depend upon the Gospels when after all, the Gospels were not composed in Galilee where Jesus came from. They were not composed in Jerusalem where Jesus died. They were not composed in Aramaic, the language that Jesus spoke, but in Greek. They were written by people who never knew Jesus in person. None of them knew Jesus in person. One of them, Luke, was not a Jew, incidentally. And the Gospels were written at least forty years after the death of Jesus. Now, coming from such sources, would evidence be admitted in a court today, let alone be ready to convict somebody?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one thing is clear, that the earliest of the Gospels certainly, usually said to be Mark, dates from around the year 70, which is long after the time of Jesus, who apparently died in the year 29. And that Jesus never wrote anything. You know, if you had an inquest in the case of Jesus, who killed Jesus, you don't have a body. You don't have anything he wrote. None of the authors of the Gospels ever talked to him. So you have nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Josephus and Jesus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's very interesting that there is one other account which, if it is authentic, does deal with the crucifixion. And that is by the Jewish historian Josephus. The question is whether Josephus really wrote it. And I've written about that, and &lt;strong&gt;I've come to the conclusion that he couldn't have written it,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;certainly in the form that we have it&lt;/em&gt;, because Origen, the Christian church father, at one point says that Josephus didn't recognize that Jesus was the Christos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Pilate and Jesus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here we have two people - and these are really the only two people who deal with Pontius Pilate at any length, namely Philo, the Jewish philosopher of Alexandria, who was the leader of the Jewish community in Alexandria, and Josephus. They both mention Pontius Pilate. I might say that Josephus mentions Pontius Pilate in both the Jewish War and in the Antiquities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The major difference, I might say, between the two accounts of Josephus is that the Jewish War account, which is almost as long as the one in the Antiquities, does not mention the passage about Jesus, which is a central focus of the Pontius Pilate account in the Antiquities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Philo says about Pontius Pilate, and again you would never get this from reading the Gospels and certainly not from Mel Gibson, that he was "inflexible, he was stubborn, of cruel disposition. He executed troublemakers without a trial." He refers to Pilate's "venality, his violence, thefts, assaults, abusive behavior, endless executions, endless savage ferocity." And I'm quoting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Philo was certainly a scholar. He apparently had good information. You can see that he certainly tries his best to be fair towards the Romans. He got along with the Romans. He was the head of a delegation to the Roman Emperor Caligula, yet this is the way he speaks about Pontius Pilate. And those are the only substantial accounts that we have of Pontius Pilate. Pontius Pilate, according to Josephus, actually took money from the Temple and built an aqueduct in Jerusalem. He offended Jewish sensibilities by attempting to introduce busts of the emperor into Jerusalem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, when the Samaritans arose to make a pilgrimage to Mt. Gerixim, he sent his soldiers, who slaughtered the people. Eventually he was deposed. The Roman governor of Syria, who was in charge of the procurators, actually forced him out of office.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The Autism Society of America is doing &lt;a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=sensoryfilms"&gt;"sensory films" nation wide&lt;/a&gt;, where the sound is turned down (yay!) and the lights are (why this item is sensory friendly I'm not sure--seems the opposite to me) turned up.  And stimming in the aisles is allowed.  Groovy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies have gotten increasingly loud in the U.S. (perhaps elsewhere too?).  When I was a kid and even a young adult, the sound-discomfort was there but bearable for a good film.  Recently if I get to the theatre and realize I've forgotten my &lt;a href="http://www.peltor.se/int/Product.asp?PageNumber=154&amp;amp;ProductCategory_Id=55&amp;amp;Product_Id=66"&gt;Peltor Optime III industrial strength muffs&lt;/a&gt; I turn around and go home.  No movie is worth sound-induced catatonia.  That's decidedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, truly, I would adore sensory friendly films with the volume somewhere nearer the tolerable range (though I could well do without the "it's OK to shout and talk" bit yikes!).  And so would a bunch of people I know who &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; on the spectrum but still find today's theaters unbearably loud.  I have checked my observation on the increased loudness of films with others and it's not just me getting cranky with age.  Like most accommodations, quieter films would likely appeal to a larger population than just those whose disability it targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, these "sensory films" are all for children.  Because adults may not have sensory issues?  Because adults don't capture the public's heart-strings?  Because no one is representing the interests of adults in the development of these programs?  Because--why?  Who knows, but it's there again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might appear childlike at times, but I am definitely no longer enthralled by Disney kids' flicks.  Maybe one or two when I'm sick with the flu, but how about a nice sensory friendly &lt;a href="http://watchmenmovie.warnerbros.com/"&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt;, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And while we're on the topic of accessible movies for all ages, what about better options for captioned films?)&lt;/p&gt;

But I wish you would actually &lt;em&gt;leave!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/27/apparently-astronomy-is-un-american/"&gt;Cosmic Variance&lt;/a&gt; I found out John McCain &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/senjohnmccain"&gt;has a Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;. That’s pretty amazing for a guy who doesn’t understand computers or &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2009/02/john_mccain_is_personally_usin.html"&gt;even use email&lt;/a&gt;, but hey, everyone’s capable of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us. McCain posted a list to Twitter of the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/1254595275"&gt;&amp;quot;TOP TEN PORKIEST PROJECTS&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;del&gt;stimulus&lt;/del&gt; Omnibus spending bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now c’mon, guess what number 2 was. Guess! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, did you guess that it would be some small amount of money that went to science and public education? Good for you! You win… well, nothing, except the chance to bang your head against a wall. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/1259912841"&gt;Here is the tweet in question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;#2. $2 million “for the promotion of astronomy” in Hawaii - because nothing says new jobs for average Americans like investing in astronomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, McCain. Maybe you’ve changed enough to learn some new tech, but it’s nice to know some things &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; change, like that you’re an antiscience know-nothing. But then, he helped set that standard with &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/16/repost-mccains-planetariophobia/"&gt;his ridiculous planetarium ravings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear: astronomy needs to be funded. It’s one of the best public-relations field science has. &lt;em&gt;People love astronomy&lt;/em&gt;. And putting that aside, astronomy is important. I don’t think I need go into that here, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/05/09/science-fare/"&gt;but you can always read this&lt;/a&gt; if you’re fuzzy on the details. Also, it touches the philosophical aspects of our lives, like how we got here and and where we’re headed. Perhaps platitudes about such things satisfy some people, but some of us are pretty well concerned with reality. &lt;em&gt;That’s why we study it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the bottom line: that 2 million dollar investment will keep people employed in a high-tech industry. What is it about Republican leaders that they don’t understand it’s not &lt;em&gt;pork&lt;/em&gt;, it’s &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt; and that equals &lt;em&gt;stimulus&lt;/em&gt;. Building a bridge that isn’t needed to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars is pork. Putting money towards science is making sure that we stay on the cutting-edge of technological capability in the world. See the difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geez, this isn’t rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, let me point out the contrast of McCain still actively unwilling to support science and science education to &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/budget.html"&gt;Obama’s wanting to fund NASA and science in next year’s budget and in the stimulus bill&lt;/a&gt;. Interesting, isn’t it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Senator McCain, let me make this clear: you, amateur exorcist and creationist &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/republican-party-still-shilling-antiscience/"&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of your backwards-facing antiscience reality-denying brethren may huff and puff and say ridiculous things — and I’m sure you’ll continue to do so — but a lot of people see right through it, and a majority of the American voting population rejected it last November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please, feel free to cling to such notions. Those of us in the reality-based community will make sure we wave as we pass you, but don’t expect us to linger on your reflection in our rear-view mirrors. We’re too busy looking ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campolo is something of a celebrity on the evangelical left, you might recall that he was a spiritual advisor to President Clinton, which makes this essay especially disappointing.  In the past I have tended to view him as an island of reason in what often seems like an ocean of evangelical narrow-mindedness.

My suitcase made the carousel before I did.  The uniformed airport greeter inside the terminal held a card saying &amp;quot;Prof Pullum&amp;quot; — not Pullam or Pullman or Pullen or any of the scores of other spellings I get on my mail labels and invoices and name badges: this seems to be a culture that cares enough to get things right.  The greeter took me to my driver.  As the sleek black car pulled away the driver said, &amp;quot;Sir, seatbelt please.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is it the law?", I asked idly, wondering if seatbelt wearing was legally enforced even for back seat passengers in limousines.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Half hour," said the driver smartly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't press the matter.  I'm not that interested in the legal culture of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong: I'm happy to wear a seatbelt whether it legally mandated or not.  I just sat back and reflected on the fact that this man was clearly my linguistic superior, by a factor of infinity.  He had recognized that I had asked him a question, guessed which one it probably was, and gave an intelligible answer.  I wish I could do even that much in Cantonese.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been bold enough to use my language.  I have not been bold enough (yet) to use a single word of his.  (This is a tone language.  I have to do a lot of listening before I will attempt even a single remark.  I am terrified of making a tonal blunder and find that instead of telling an elegant companion "That's a lovely dress" I have accidentally said "There is abundant horse shit.")  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The length of our journey along coastside freeways and spectacular suspension bridges to the Harbour Plaza Metropolis in Hung Hom on the Kowloon peninsula was indeed about half an hour.  At one point my driver waved an arm in the general direction of the ocean and made a remark about the bitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he had been an American gangster rapper, I might have expected to find that he was pointing out some fine-looking women in tight red dresses on the corner; but I had encountered this problem of short high front vowel quality before when talking English with a Chinese speaker, so here at least I was linguistically prepared.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked down the hillside where he had pointed (we were going along a steep slope above the water, amid scenery rather like parts of Route 1 in California), and as I expected, there were sandy strips where one could swim.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;But they’re also dangerous. They won’t give you cancer or yank out the iron in your blood or anything like that. But because they are so strong, they can attract each other quite, um, forcefully. I’ve had a finger nicked once or twice by them, and it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But geez, &lt;a href="http://www.magnetnerd.com/Neodymium%20Magnets/Dirks%20Accident.htm"&gt;let this guy’s story be a stronger cautionary tale&lt;/a&gt;. WARNING: nasty trauma images in there. Don’t eat dinner while reading it. Barf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I’ll play with my magnets; I have a little ball magnet about 2 cm across that is way too much fun to roll across a floor. I’d love to find a flat frictionless space to roll it, and see how much it deflects due to torque from the Earth’s magnetic field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I’m a dork. But I have all my fingertips!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235779015956"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/211_million">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2eaf2a4c4838700e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">$211 Million</title><published>2009-02-27T22:37:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T22:37:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/211_million" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.millenniumhwy.net/2007_WV_VA_Day_2/2007_WV_VA_Day_2-Thumbnails/115.jpg" height="120" alt="Hwy 211 sign in Virginia from millenniumhighway.net" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="150"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The older PLoS journals have been making collections for a long time. PLoS ONE is just starting. Last month we put together the first such collection - &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pone.c01.i01" title=""&gt;Stress-Induced Depression and Comorbidities: From Bench to Bedside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are happy to unveil our second collection - the PLoS ONE &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info:doi/10.1371/issue.pone.c01.i02" title=""&gt;Paleontology Collection&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that there are two types of collections: the first type is a one-off, closed collection, often associated with a conference, where we ask for or are offered a whole set of manuscripts (10-20 papers) which are all submitted roughly at the same time, peer-reviewed in a normal fashion, then, if accepted, published roughly at the same time. Then, the collection is closed - there are no more additions to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paleontology Collection is different - it is an open collection. This means that all of our papers to date (PLoS ONE only, not other PLoS journals) that deal with fossils in any way, 26 of them so far, are included in the collection.  Furthermore, all the future palaeo papers will be automatically added to the Collection as soon as they are published. Thus, such papers will always be placed together, prominently displayed and easy to find - just a single click is needed to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hoping that the open style of this Collection will motivate people in the field to &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/static/checklist.action" title=""&gt;submit&lt;/a&gt; palaeo papers to us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second note: as it's my job to check all the user activity on PLoS ONE, I have noticed that palaeo folks are unusually willing to use the comments/notes/ratings tools.  Several of our fossil papers already have quite a lot of comments, notes, ratings and/or trackbacks (you should go to &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/446" title=""&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; to see the examples). So, I would like to use this occasion to try to urge people to register, login and post comments, notes or ratings on palaeo papers, or send trackbacks if their blogging platforms allow it (Blogger.com can't do it). I think that the palaeo community can be an example to others for the good and vigorous use of these tools.  So, if you blog about this new Collection (and I hope you will help us spread the word) I would appreciate it if you would also encourage your blog readers to start using these tools on our fossil papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/plos_paleontology_collections.php" title=""&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt; immediatelly understood why &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseVolume.action;jsessionid=C368219A3E89D5A3F08FCD6EF13A6C81" title=""&gt;Collections&lt;/a&gt; are so useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;PLoS ONE is a veritable fire hose of OpenAccess research. Which is nice, but how do you browse a fire hose?

&lt;p&gt;By using the PLoS ONE collections you can track your favorite topic or delve into the earlier literature or just browse around. And now, starting just moments ago, there is a PLoS collection on paleontology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/02/plos-ones-paleontology-collection.html" title=""&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; adds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why should we care? Speaking selfishly, this will allow us to easily access all articles in our field. All future articles are automatically added to the collection. This means that if you don't want to wade through all of the other contributions on the PLoS ONE list (although there are some very interesting ones!), you can just keep an eye on the paleontology collection for any and all exciting developments. In a broader sense, this collection will help paleontologists to reach an even broader audience.

&lt;p&gt;And once again--take advantage of the comment, note, and rating features at PLoS ONE (as outlined in my previous post). It's really a unique opportunity to interact with authors, make your thoughts known, and help science march onward. If you have that really cool piece of research, submit your manuscript!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a word or two on my own musings about this Collection. As these 26 papers were published over the past two years, I knew I personally liked them very much, but only now that they are all in one place I realized why: they are all incredibly inter-disciplinary! These papers are not just simple descriptions of new species. They tend to combine insights and techniques from several disciplines, e.g., comparative anatomy and molecular systematics, biogeography and physiology and more.  These are kinds of papers that don't readily find home in other, more specialized journals, except in Science and Nature.  PLoS ONE is, almost by definition, a perfect place for publication of such works. And Open Access ensures that such papers are widely read, covered by media and blogs, and later, hopefully, more often cited than papers hidden behind pay-walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and enjoy - introducing the PLoS ONE &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info:doi/10.1371/issue.pone.c01.i02" title=""&gt;Paleontology Collection&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/fossils_fossils_fossils.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/_tlGVG436GA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235774924947"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1189">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/631e816c61c52e5e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Obituaries"/><title type="html">In memoriam Michael Noonan</title><published>2009-02-27T22:42:04Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T22:42:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1189" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mickey Noonan, of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, who died a few days ago, is movingly memorialized by Carol Genetti in a posting originally to the Linguistic Typology mailing list and now available on-line via the Linguist List, &lt;a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/20/20-619.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235774011039"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/27/apparently-astronomy-is-un-american/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8306ac716554034b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogosphere"/><category term="Science and Politics"/><title type="html">Apparently Astronomy is Un-American</title><published>2009-02-27T22:26:57Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T22:26:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/27/apparently-astronomy-is-un-american/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/senjohnmccain"&gt;John McCain has a twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The administrative hearing on the Mt. Vernon, Ohio, Board of Education’s resolution to terminate the employment of John Freshwater as an 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science teacher resumed this morning for just half a day.  Due to attorney conflicts and witness unavailability issues, the session was adjourned at 12:15 after hearing just three witnesses, all former students of Freshwater.  The hearing will resume on March 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening Maneuvering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today saw the resumption of Freshwater’s defense case.  The first witness called by R. Kelly Hamilton, Freshwater’s attorney, was Mr. James Beroth.  He is the father of a woman named Melanie Dobson from the state of Oregon who apparently overheard a conversation in a restaurant between Ian Watson, the President of the Board of Education, and an unidentified second person on December 29, 2007 (I’m pretty sure it was 2007 – see subpoena note below).  Hamilton entered an affidavit from Ms. Dobson as an exhibit and began to examine Mr. Beroth on it because if would be a hardship for Ms. Dobson to come to Ohio from Oregon to testify.  The examination got just far enough to establish that Beroth himself had overheard nothing, and that Melanie’s affidavit referred to Watson talking in the restaurant about “decisions” or “strategies” or “goals” regarding Freshwater when David Millstone, attorney for the Board, objected on the ground that the affidavit must speak for itself, and that Mr. Beroth could only reflect hearsay since he himself had not heard Watson.  After some discussion the hearing referee upheld the objection and Mr. Beroth was excused from testifying.  Immediately Hamilton handed a subpoena to Millstone requiring Ian Watson’s personal and work calendars from December 2007 to the present.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is relevant because December 29, 2007, was after the Dennis family complained to the school administration about Freshwater burning a cross on Zachary’s arm (early December 2007) but before the independent investigation occurred in late spring 2008.  Hamilton’s move here is consistent with other hints he’s made to the effect that the investigation was not actually independent but rather was a sham designed to provide justification/cover for firing Freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton then called Karl Heck.  Heck is the uncle and guardian of Corbin Heck, a current 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grader and former student of Freshwater in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science.  Heck was sworn and Hamilton began questioning Heck regarding an affidavit that Corbin had signed just yesterday in front of Hamilton that reflected a conversation Corbin had with Hamilton several weeks ago.  Millstone objected on the ground that Karl Heck could not testify to the content of the affidavit but only to hearsay, and that unlike Melanie Dobson, Corbin Heck is available a mile or so away at the high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton told the hearing referee that he intended to call parents of a number of former students to testify about affidavits their children had signed, and Millstone indicated that he would enter the same objection to their testimony.  Hamilton got dramatic about preserving the childrens’ anonymity and protecting them from having to testify in public.  (Recall that it was Hamilton who earlier successfully urged the hearing referee to breech the Dennis family’s anonymity and have Zachary Dennis testify in public.)  Hamilton’s histrionics had little effect and the referee ultimately ruled that since there was no availability issue with the students, they and not their parents would have to testify if their affidavits were to be entered in evidence.   So Karl Heck was excused and we had a lengthy recess while the first student, Corbin Heck, was fetched from the school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corbin Heck Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin testified that he met twice with Hamilton previous to today, and that Hamilton had prepared an affidavit from notes made from their conversations.  Corbin made a few minor corrections and swore to it and signed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin testified that he was in class when the Tesla coil was used on Zach Dennis.  Corbin testified that he had the Tesla coil touched to his arm, and felt a “tickle” but no pain.  There was no mark immediately, but after a few minutes there was a faint red mark, which Corbin described as a “pinkish X.”  It was gone later that evening.  Corbin had included a hand drawing of the mark in his affidavit.  It was an “X” about the size of a half dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin testified that Freshwater first applied the Tesla coil to tubes of gases, causing them to glow, then to himself, and then to students who wanted to try it.  Corbin said the majority of the class (12-13 students out of 21) had it done.  Zach Dennis was among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shown the pictures alleged to be of Zach’s arm later that night, Corbin testified that he hadn’t seen anything like that.  He said “This is much more dramatic than any other I’d seen.”  Corbin testified he didn’t see a mark on Zach’s arm.  The width of the mark on Corbin’s arm was about the size of the ball in a ballpoint pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin testified that he and Zach had been and still are friends – they have classes together, frequently eat lunch together, and Zach has been to his house as recently as late fall 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin testified that Freshwater used the coil in the same manner for all the students, and didn’t put his hands on any students.  Corbin denied that Freshwater held any student’s arm.  He said no one seemed to be in distress.  He said that when Zach was zapped he laughed, and that Freshwater didn’t hold Zach’s arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin testified that he attended FCA general membership meetings 5 or 6 times, and never saw Freshwater pray at one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under direct questions, Corbin denied that Freshwater taught from the Bible or promoted his religious beliefs in class.  Corbin described Freshwater as “…literally, the best science teacher I’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if he would have recognized if Freshwater taught religious concepts, Corbin agreed that he would.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one of their meetings Hamilton showed Corbin the Watchmaker video that previous testimony has indicated was shown in class.  Corbin denied ever having seen it before.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under direct questions from Hamilton, Corbin denied that Zach showed any signs of emotional instability or distress.  (Those are Hamilton’s terms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corbin Heck Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Millstone established that according to school records, Corbin missed 23 days of school last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Millstone asked about the use of the word “here!” (or “hear!) by students in Freshwater’s class.  Corbin explained that “… if something wasn’t a fact that was listed in the text as a fact we’d say ‘here’.”  For example, Corbin testified, “… if something in the book said something like earth was 6 billion years old we said ‘here’. If the test said a rock was about 4 billion years old we’d say ‘here’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corbin affirmed that a class was spent on a debate about creationism and evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ended the cross examination; there was no redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathan Thomas Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan Thomas was another student of Freshwater in 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science in the 2007-2008 school year.  He met twice with Hamilton at Freshwater’s church, and Hamilton again created an affidavit that Nathan made a few correction on and then swore to and signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan testified that he notified his pastor, who notified Hamilton, because he read in the newspaper something he knew to be false.  Specifically, he read that Bill Oxenford, another middle school science teacher, testified that he had ceased using the Tesla coil in class some 10 years ago, when he (Nathan) saw it used in his 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade class with Oxenford three years ago.  At that time students were allowed to bring a finger near the tip to draw an arc.  Nathan named other students who were in Oxenford’s class that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan testified that in his 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade class Freshwater used the Tesla coil in a manner similar to Oxenford, holding the Tesla coil motionless while students put their forefinger near it to draw an arc.  Nathan testified that he knew of no occurrence of an injury other than the one at issue in this hearing (my words, not Nathan’s).  Nathan testified that Freshwater didn’t put a cross on anyone in his class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan denied that Freshwater ever preached in class, and that he would know the difference if it had happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief questioning about FCA, Nathan testified that two students did “most of” the calling of outside speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathan Thomas Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cross examination Millstone established that in his affidavit Nathan had sworn that Freshwater “presented both sides”: “He’d present evolution, and then say some people believe that God created the universe.”  Asked whether there was a debate in class about creationism, Nathan responded there was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked if Freshwater ever questioned facts in the textbook, Nathan responded “Yes, because relative dates are not accurate.”  Pressed a little further, Nathan identified “Fossils and trees and stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about the use of “here!” in class, Nathan testified that it was used by students “when there was a date in the book we’d say ‘here.’  When the book said a fossil was 49 million years old we’d say ‘here’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathan Thomas Re-direct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redirect established that Freshwater was Nathan’s Sunday School teacher in 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grades.  Asked about the difference between Sunday School and science class, Nathan said in Sunday School Freshwater taught his beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no recross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riley Swanson Direct Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riley Swanson is another former student in one of Freshwater’s 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science classes.  He testified that the Tesla coil was not used in his class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked about FCA, Riley testified that he attended both the regular meetings and the leadership meetings, and that two other students, including Jordan Freshwater, did the bulk of the leading, with Jordan doing the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riley remembered the healing prayer incident, saying that all prayed for the pastor who had the health problem.  He couldn’t remember specifically who was there praying.  Riley testified that Freshwater didn’t pray with students and never forced (Hamilton’s word) students to pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the incidents surrounding Joe Barone described &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/freshwater-day-3.html#more" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, Riley testified that his older brother was a friend of Luke Freshwater (one of the students alleged to have taunted Joe Barone), and that his brother was “shocked” by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riley testified that by pre-arrangement, he and his parents met a number of other students from FCA to attend “Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riley testified that Freshwater was his “… favorite teacher and I can’t believe he’d hurt anyone on purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riley testified that he was interviewed by HR On Call during its investigation, but he recalled nothing at all about it beyond the fact that two people, a male and female, interviewed him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Riley testified that Zach Dennis is “my friend,” and that Zach had never expressed anything negative about Freshwater to him.  Asked by Hamilton if Zach appeared to be emotionally unstable or distressed, Riley denied it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Riley Swanson Cross Examination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In  cross Riley again testified that he remembered nothing at all about the HR On Call interview, and nothing at all about a Tesla coil.  He couldn’t remember how FCA speakers were contacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brief Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton today focused on two themes.  First, he once again tried to establish that if Freshwater wasn’t preaching directly from the Bible it ain’t a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.  In his questions of former students he repeatedly returned to “Did he [Freshwater] preach from the Bible in class?”  “Did he teach Noah’s Flood?”  And so on.  I don’t know if Hamilton or the hearing examiner is familiar with the jurisprudence on the creationism issue in the schools, but I know David Millstone is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s second theme, reflected in questions asked of two of the former students, was aimed at Zach Dennis’ emotional state.  And again, this is a return to Hamilton’s attack on the Dennis family in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross examination of the students appears to have hurt Freshwater more than their direct testimony helped him.  Two of the students, Corbin Heck and Nathan Thomas, testified to the use of the response “Here!” to indicate the unreliability of the text book, particularly with respect to dating.  Recall that Freshwater is a young earth creationist.  Further, Nathan testified that Freshwater presented evolution and then remarked that “some people believe that God created the universe.”  Corbin affirmed earlier testimony that there was a debate about creationism and evolution in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hearing is now adjourned until March 20, with three more days scheduled for March 25-27.  The hearing referee gave notice that he will be scheduling days in April soon.  Recall that this hearing started in October 2008; we may be here until the next World Series!&lt;/p&gt;

It was from the Catholic League! It included a personal, signed note from &lt;i&gt;Bill Donohue&lt;/i&gt;! It also said "SWAK" and all the 'i's were dotted with hearts! (Oh, OK, I made up that last bit. A boy can dream, you know.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was their &lt;i&gt;2008 Report on Anti-Catholicism&lt;/i&gt;, a 74-page exercise in institutional paranoia, and I am featured on pages 26-30! Oh, joy! You know what that means: I can expect another uptick in sad letters from nuns and pious little old ladies in Waukegan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One curious thing about those letters: they are all the same, and they all come in neatly lettered envelopes with printed return addresses in the top left corner, and they all come from Mrs. John Smith or Mrs. George Jones or some variant thereof. I don&amp;#39;t know any of the names of these women, but I do know their husband&amp;#39;s names.

&lt;p&gt;But it also got me thinking about my own education and the value of it. With a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree, I went pretty far up the higher education ladder and I do have a good, well-paying job now.  But I don’t actually believe that those two things are causal.  My own personal experience was that college didn’t really prepare me for the real world and a lot of what I have accomplished has been through skills and experience I learned on the job. Plus, since I went to a private university, college was extremely expensive for my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is college worth it? What are the factors that make it worthwhile? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Both my degrees are non science and non technical - I’m a liberal arts major (English &amp;amp; Corporate Communication) all the way.  I would never dispute that, for example, med school, wasn’t worth it. I’m talking more here about degrees in softer subjects. I’m looking at you, journalism and philosophy majors! &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235766019674"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10614446.post-8339882624084188422">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a3d5d0363920466</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Skeptics'' Circle #106 descends upon the world</title><published>2009-02-27T14:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T14:05:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2009/02/skepitcs-circle-106-descends-upon-world.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Orac)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Circular Reasoning</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235764859171"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3491315729030964348">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6e34cc1e52dba5a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Journalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Matt Nisbet Chooses Sides</title><published>2009-02-27T19:13:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T20:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/matt-nisbet-choses-sides.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3491315729030964348/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3491315729030964348" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Carl Zimmer has posted another article on the Geroge Will affair [Unchecked Ice: A Saga in Five Chapters].

The patterns will not surprise anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest consumer, Utah, averaged 5.47 adult content subscriptions per 1000 home broadband users; Montana bought the least with 1.92 per 1000. "The differences here are not so stark," Edelman says.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Eight of the top 10 pornography consuming states gave their electoral votes to John McCain in last year's presidential election - Florida and Hawaii were the exceptions. While six out of the lowest 10 favoured Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Republican states gobbled up more nekkid pitchers than Democratic states… but of course, one could argue that it was just the few Democrats in Utah who were slavering most obsessively over porn, while the Republican Mormons were being upright (no, wait, maybe that&amp;#39;s the wrong word…) Montana is a conservative state, too, but maybe the ready availability of all those cows helps slake their forbidden lusts.&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about those good Christians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;States where a majority of residents agreed with the statement "I have old-fashioned values about family and marriage," bought 3.6 more subscriptions per thousand people than states where a majority disagreed. A similar difference emerged for the statement "AIDS might be God's punishment for immoral sexual behaviour."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh. Now we all know what "values" is a code word for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;Uh-oh.

When all the evidence is against them, when their hero — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/07/did-the-founder-of-the-antivax-movement-fake-autism-vaccine-link/"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; — turns out to have not just feet of clay but claims of mud, when scientific study after scientific study shows no link between vaccines and autism, when kids are getting sick and dying because people believe the antiscience claims of the antivax/pro-disease movement, what do antivaxxers like Jenny McCarthy, David Kirby, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, they just keep boldly spreading nonsense, garbage, and propaganda, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need not go into details here, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;Orac has done it very thoroughly&lt;/a&gt; (and has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirby_and_autism_speaks_sittin_in.php"&gt;followup info&lt;/a&gt;), as has &lt;a href="http://skepticdad.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/antivaccine-hail-mary/"&gt;Skeptic Dad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess if you’re putting kids’ lives at risk, bearing false witness is a far less unforgivable sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it before, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/449-the-amazing-meeting-7-events.html"&gt;at TAM 7 we’re holding a vaccination drive in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, to make sure that kids get the protection they need against easily preventable diseases.

If you haven&amp;#39;t got your tickets yet, you can &lt;a href="http://tuibguy.com/?p=10"&gt;join Minnesota Atheists and get one for free&lt;/a&gt; — so act fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an additional inducement, guess who is going to introduce Dawkins at the lecture? Me! Now you might be saying, "Bleh, who wants to listen to Myers babble?", but you'd be missing the important point: I'm only going to talk for 30 seconds to a minute, and then get out of the way. More Dawkins, less annoying functionary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if we can get a full house at the Northrup, I&amp;#39;ll go one better — I&amp;#39;ll just say &amp;quot;Heeeeeeere&amp;#39;s Richard Dawkins!&amp;quot; and get off the stage. So buy more tickets, and shut me up (watch for the rush on the &lt;a href="https://www.tickets.umn.edu/Online/default.asp?brand=UMATO"&gt;Northrup box office&lt;/a&gt; now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there will be a semi-secret pub night afterwards.

&lt;div style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blogging on Peer-Reviewed Research" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/rb.png" width="120" height="90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that beautiful? It&amp;#39;s an ancient footprint in some lumpy rocks in Kenya…but it is 1½ million years old. It comes from the Koobi Fora formation, familiar to anyone who follows human evolution, and is probably from &lt;i&gt;Homo ergaster&lt;/i&gt;. There aren&amp;#39;t a lot of them; one series of three hominin trails containing 2-7 prints, and a stratigraphically separate section with one trail of 2 prints and an isolated single print. But there they are, a preserved record of a trivial event — a few of our remote relatives taking a walk across a mudflat by a river — rendered awesome by their rarity and the magnitude of the time separating us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's one of the trails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/trail_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/trail.jpeg" width="400" height="178" alt="trail.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tessellated swath of optical laser scans of the main footprint trail on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E. Color is rendered with 5-mm isopleths.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting bridge across time. There they were, a couple of pre-humans out for a stroll, perhaps on their way to find something for lunch, or strolling off to urinate, probably nothing dramatic, and these few footprints were left in drying mud to be found over a million years later, when they would be scanned with a laser, digitized, and analyzed with sophisticated software, and then uploaded to a digital network where everyone in the world can take a look at them. Something so ephemeral can be translated across incomprehensible ages…I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but I&amp;#39;m wondering about the possible future fate of the debris of my life that has ended up in landfills, or the other small smudges across the landscape that I&amp;#39;ve left behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what have we learned? The analysis has looked at the shape of the foot, the angle of the big toe, the distribution of weight as the hominins walked across the substrate, all the anatomical and physiological details that can be possibly extracted from a few footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/prints_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/prints.jpeg" width="400" height="256" alt="prints.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Optical laser scan images color-rendered with 5-mm isopleths for footprints at both FwJj14E and GaJi10. (A) Isolated left foot (FUI1) on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E. (B) Photograph of FUI8 on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E, showing good definition of the toe pads; the second toe is partially obscured by the third toe. (C) Second trail on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E, showing two left feet. (D) Third trail on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E, showing a right and a left foot. (E) Print R3 from GaJi10 (22), re-excavated and scanned as part of this investigation. (F) Partial print (FUT1-2) on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E; the heel area has been removed by a later bovid print. (G) Print FLI1 on the lower footprint surface at FwJj14E, rendered with 5-mm alternating black and white isopleths. (H) Inverted image of the toe area of print FUT1-1 with alternating 5-mm black and white isopleths. Note the locations of the pads of the small toes and the presence of a well-defined ball beneath the hallucial metatarsophalangeal joint. The first, third, and fifth toes are marked D1, D3, and D5, respectively.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that these beings walked just like us. The tracks are noticeably different from the even older footprints of australopithecines found at Laetoli, from 3.5 million years ago. The foot shape and the stride of &lt;i&gt;Homo ergaster&lt;/i&gt; was statistically indistinguishable from those of modern humans, even though we know from the bones associated with these species that they were cranially distinct from us. This is not a surprise; it's been known for a long time that we evolved these bipedal forms long ago, and that the cerebral innovations we regard as so characteristic of humanity are a relative late-comer in our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, these are &lt;i&gt;1½ million years old&lt;/i&gt;, 250 times older than the age of the earth, according to creationists. That's a lot of wonder and history and evidence to throw away, but they do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

Too often "autism awareness" translates directly to, "a bunch of harsh, dehumanizing marketing telling the world that you are worthless trash."  So I nearly didn't click on the link called &lt;a href="http://www.timminspress.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1451078"&gt;Northern College Awareness Days puts focus on autism&lt;/a&gt;--but I'm glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems, from the story at least, that Northern College in Canada has taken "awareness" to mean "awareness of a perspective besides your own," and has been doing disability "awareness days" for the past 20 years, including this clever exercise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the morning, about 39 teams will gather in the college's main foyer for the beginning of the wheelchair rally, which takes able-bodied people through a course in the college in attempts to complete challenges and win points for their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It really opens their minds," Frappier said. "Going up and down a ramp, someone without a disability might take this for granted, but when you're in a wheelchair it's a little different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A majority of the challenges are related to autism, but there are some related to other disabilities." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no small event either--Northern College is expecting about 200 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish there were more details about the types of challenges related to autism planned--would the challenges be similar to the simulations of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simulations_and_analogies_for_understanding_autism"&gt;yada4schools&lt;/a&gt;?  I do hope so.  I do hope it's as perspective-enhancing as the wheelchair piece, and not just a bunch of advertisements about how terrible people like me are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish even more for the term "autism awareness" lose its more current sense of "&lt;a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/thenandnow.html"&gt;look at what a nasty horrible problem autistic people are&lt;/a&gt;" and start being used more commonly in the sense of "see what it's like to be be an autistic person."  Only with the latter can &lt;a href="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/bridging.htm"&gt;mutual understanding&lt;/a&gt; and communication be built.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235759714785"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1188">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a33e70358be12418</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the law"/><title type="html">Zhao C:  a Man Who Lost His Name</title><published>2009-02-27T18:29:35Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T18:29:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1188" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mark Swofford, Steve Hansen, and Anne Henochowicz have just called my attention to &lt;a href="http://www.danwei.org/language/zhao_left_crescent_needs_a_new.php"&gt;a wonderful post by Joel Martinsen over at Danwei&lt;/a&gt; which tells about a man named Zhao C who was informed by the Public Security Bureau of the People's Republic of China that he can no longer call himself "C," something that he has been doing his entire life.  Mr. Zhao and his father, a lawyer, brought suit against the Public Security Bureau.  Last June, a district court in Yingtan, Jiangxi Province, found in Zhao C's favor, but the Public Security Bureau appealed.  As one might have expected, Mr. Zhao was ultimately forced to "voluntarily" change his name.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government's position that Mr. Zhao's name violated rules and that their computers were not equipped to handle "non-standard characters" is, to say the least, disingenuous, since the roman alphabet is in evidence all over China.  In the first place, Hanyu Pinyin is the official roman orthography of the People's Republic of China, enshrined in the law.  Second, all Chinese schoolchildren learn to read Chinese through the medium of Pinyin and they also all learn English.  Third, the most famous literary figure of the 20th century was named Ah-Q, and many Chinese novels have personal and place names that incorporate roman letters. Fourth, as Mark Hansell pointed out already in "The Sino-Alphabet:  The Assimilation of Roman Letters into the Chinese Writing System," &lt;em&gt;Sino-Platonic Papers&lt;/em&gt;, 45 (May, 1994), 1-28, the roman alphabet has long since been fully incorporated into the Chinese script. Fifth, there are entire dictionaries consisting of thousands of what are called ZI4MU3CI2 字母詞 ("letter words").  Even standard dictionaries, such as the &lt;em&gt;Xiandai Hanyu Cidian&lt;/em&gt; (Dictionary of Modern Chinese), which was edited by scholars at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and published by the famous Shangwu Yinshu Guan (Commercial Press), either have a section devoted to "letter words" at the back or integrate them into the main body of entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martinsen's post ends thus:  "Zhao Zhirong told the &lt;em&gt;Information Daily&lt;/em&gt; that he and his son don't have any good ideas for a new name, so they're asking the public for suggestions."

Considering the stakes, I’m sure you’re all on the edge of your seats, waiting to know who is about to be anointed. But first, other stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been awhile since I’ve highlighted tips and tricks for our newest commenters. The intro email you get when you sign up to comment here has this info, but I know a lot of people don’t read it (I probably wouldn’t, though it’s also located &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=2809"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), so, some highlights: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Get a picture by your name by signing up at &lt;a href="http://www.gravatar.com"&gt;Gravatar.com&lt;/a&gt; using the same email address you used here on Skepchick. Follow the directions there and give it some time to work. Your avatar will appear automagically!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Reply to a comment by clicking the arrow to the right of it. That pastes code into your comment box linking back to the original comment with an @ sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Nominate a comment for Comment o’ the Week by replying to it and including the letters COTW somewhere in your post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Tell me what other questions you have by commenting below or by using the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;. I’m always looking for ways to update the site to be easier to navigate and interact with others. Also, let me know if you have any suggestions for site improvements. I can’t promise I’ll do everything, but I’ll certainly read all your comments and try to implement the best and most feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay? Okay. COMMENT O’ THE WEEK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s winner was actually nominated three times, which is tough to ignore. And believe me, I tried to ignore it. Repeatedly. Oh, just kidding. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6170&amp;amp;cpage=2#comment-52881"&gt;Congratulations Oskar Kennedy (LBB)&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote this comment in response to Elyse’s AI question asking whether or not love conquers all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel="external nofollow" href="http://suburbanpanic.com/"&gt;Oskar Kennedy (LBB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="external nofollow" href="http://suburbanpanic.com/"&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b95f4d61692f776070ccc369fc8968a?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Feb 23, 2009 at 5:36 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, love CONQUERS All, but it has a hell of a time maintaining its grip. Supply lines get so long as to be unmanageable, then you get resistance fighters and insurgencies. The citizens of All refuse to pay taxes, then they start organizing massive street protests that end in rioting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the West starts arming the guerrillas, and before you know it Love’s forces have been ground down and defeated, its local government deposed and replaced by representatives of Boredom and Bitterness. Love withdraws in disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the march home, Love often forms a temporary alliance with Lust to occupy Someone Convenient, only to find that the location isn’t all that strategic and the locals just aren’t as interesting as the folks in All. That alliance disintegrates, and Love winds up back where it started, in an uneasy and often contentious partnership with Self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-up this week was Expatria, with &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6208&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-53077"&gt;this trouser-snake reference&lt;/a&gt;. The irony here is that I hang out with Expatria quite a bit (he happens to be the Boston Skeptics’ Vice President of Doing Stuff) and he comes up with a good Afternoon Inquisition every other day. Maybe next time, Ex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Oskar, please use the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt; to send us your suggested AI topic. If it meets approval, it will go public at 3pm ET next Wednesday.

Jeff Stingerstein lays it all out in a "just the facts, m'am" manner that demonstrates that, for all the fantastically creative and wild formats that prior hosts have used to present the last fortnight's skepticism, sometimes the straightforward is just as satisfying--especially given the quality of this edition's entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up in two weeks will be &lt;a href="http://www.skepticsfieldguide.net"&gt;Skeptics' Field Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Start revving up your skeptical keyboards and supply Jeff and Theo with the material they need to keep the tradition alive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as always, I am always looking for hosts. Indeed, I've been amazed at how good  Skeptics' Circle hosts have been and how rare it is for the Circle to be a clunker. Still, I'm continually on the prowl for new skeptical talent, and I'm always happy when past hosts decide they want to give it another whirl. All the information you need to host is &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-reloaded.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The original idea was to imagine a new long-range force that couples directly to dark matter, but not to ordinary visible matter.  (A simple scalar force, which is universally attractive between any two objects, as opposed to all the messy complications of a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/10/29/dark-photons/"&gt;dark electromagnetic force&lt;/a&gt;.)  Due to the magic of quantum mechanics, such a force will couple indirectly to ordinary matter via virtual particles.  So in the first paper we studied how you could use fifth-force searches in ordinary matter to look for such dark forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we are a little more systematic, and we follow &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3060"&gt;Jo Bovy and Glennys Farrar&lt;/a&gt; in also considering consequences for direct dark matter detection experiments, as well as dark matter searches at colliders.  Here is the (somewhat lengthy) abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.4461"&gt;Implications of a Scalar Dark Force for Terrestrial Experiments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Authors: Sean M. Carroll, Sonny Mantry, Michael J. Ramsey-Musolf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Abstract: A long range Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) violating force between Dark Matter (DM) particles, mediated by an ultralight scalar, is tightly constrained by galactic dynamics and large scale structure formation. We examine the implications of such a “dark force” for several terrestrial experiments, including Eotvos tests of the WEP, direct-detection DM searches, and collider studies. The presence of a dark force implies a non-vanishing effect in Eotvos tests that could be probed by current and future experiments depending on the DM model. For scalar singlet DM scenarios, a dark force of astrophysically relevant magnitude is ruled out in large regions of parameter space by the DM relic density and WEP constraints. WEP tests also imply constraints on the Higgs-exchange contributions to the spin-independent (SI) DM-nucleus direct detection cross-section. For WIMP scenarios, these considerations constrain Higgs-exchange contributions to the SI cross-section to be subleading compared to gauge-boson mediated contributions. In multicomponent DM scenarios, a dark force would preclude large shifts in the rate for Higgs decay to two photons associated with DM-multiplet loops that might otherwise lead to measurable deviations at the LHC or a future linear collider. The combination of observations from galactic dynamics, large scale structure formation, Eotvos experiments, DM-direct-detection experiments, and colliders can further constrain the size of new long range forces in the dark sector. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The looming problem with this whole game is that a long-range scalar force is unnatural.  A scalar field should, by all rights, have a large mass, and that kind of mass drastically limits the range of the corresponding force.  (That’s why the weak interactions are negligible compared to electromagnetism for everyday purposes; the W and Z bosons have a large mass, while the photon is massless.)  You can keep scalar fields light by imposing symmetries, but that also tends to squelch any interesting interactions.  But okay, it’s also unnatural for the Higgs boson to have a mass less than the Planck scale, or for the cosmological constant to be much less than the Planck scale.  Unnatural things happen in the real world, so it’s not crazy to try to understand how they would manifest themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, once you’ve allowed yourself some unnaturalness, where do you stop?  In this paper we’ve tried hard to minimize the number of parameters we unnaturally tuned to small values.  We’ve tuned things to keep the scalar field light while not messing up the mass of the ordinary Higgs field, but tried not to tune anything else.  In that case there should be mixing of the new scalar with the Higgs, and that mixing plays an important role in the phenomenology.  In particular, there are implications for ground-based experiments; thus the title!  It’s a long paper, but if you read one paper on the implications of a scalar dark force for terrestrial experiments this week, it should definitely be this one.&lt;/p&gt;

First the fireball, and now a heavily battered piece of metal which dropped into a house the other day. I first heard of it when someone sent me the link &lt;a href="http://visz.rsoe.hu/alertmap/woalert_read.php?cid=20651&amp;amp;lang=eng"&gt;to an alert in Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, of all places (you gotta love an Emergency and Disaster Information Service that has a listing for &amp;quot;Cosmic Event&amp;quot;). But when I read the copy, the description was familiar…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Dallas, Texas family got a rude surprise when they came home Wednesday [Feb. 25]. They discovered a gaping hole in their roof, another hole in a bedroom and a chunk of metal on their kitchen floor. It was described as a 6-pound piece of metal with two drill holes in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six pounds? Two holes in it? Wait a sec, that sounds like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/18/the-sky-is-falling/"&gt;the grinder tip that fell on a New Jersey warehouse&lt;/a&gt; last week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/img/02-09/0225spacejunklg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/dallas_metal1.jpg" alt="Metal that fell in Texas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, &lt;a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/022509dnmetdebris.1ad0542.html"&gt;Dallas News picked up the story &lt;/a&gt;, and the picture they posted (small version shown here, &lt;a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/img/02-09/0225spacejunklg.jpg"&gt;click to embiggen&lt;/a&gt;) clinches it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s no meteorite, no piece of satellite debris. Despite it being a lot more worn and slagged, it’s obvious that it’s another grinder tip, a large piece of metal that acts like a giant tooth in an industrial grinder. I’m guessing that these things move at high speed around a belt, and sometimes dislodge, flinging them high in the air. What amazes me is timing! We have two of these flying through buildings a thousand kilometers and roughly a week apart, which is small number statistics but implies that these things happen fairly often. But the tip is big, and heavy, and flies at high speed; you’d think that if this were a common occurrence we’d see a few people getting killed by them! After all, these grinders are not in the the middle of the ocean, they would be in populated areas, where living, breathing targets are abundant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So either this doesn’t happen all that often, or that even in densely populated areas we’re still rather spread out, making us hard to hit. Or maybe people don’t report it very much… but with all the news about death (or really bad bruising) from the skies lately, maybe we’ll hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if a giant lump of metal with two hexagonal holes in it slams through your house and scares your cat, send me a note. Or send one to Fred Phelps. After all, &lt;em&gt;he’s&lt;/em&gt; the one who says God hates slags&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="40% align="&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a name="footnote_slag"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Note for you UK folks: in the U.S., &amp;quot;slag&amp;quot; is a piece of industrial dross, throwaway metal leftover from various processes. However, given what it means on your side of the pond, this joke takes on another meaning which matches Phelps’ even better, making me laugh even more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235752115538"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6491565234564596282">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/016269e6ad61a362</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Atheist Ad Campaign on The Agenda</title><published>2009-02-27T15:52:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T16:25:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/atheist-ad-campaign-on-agenda.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6491565234564596282/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6491565234564596282" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> TV Ontario (TVO) has a daily program called The Agenda with Steve Paikin.

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that beautiful? It’s an ancient footprint in some lumpy rocks in Kenya…but it is 1½ million years old. It comes from the Koobi Fora formation, familiar to anyone who follows human evolution, and is probably from &lt;em&gt;Homo ergaster&lt;/em&gt;. There aren’t a lot of them; one series of three hominin trails containing 2-7 prints, and a stratigraphically separate section with one trail of 2 prints and an isolated single print. But there they are, a preserved record of a trivial event — a few of our remote relatives taking a walk across a mudflat by a river — rendered awesome by their rarity and the magnitude of the time separating us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s one of the trails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:406px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/trail_lg.php" rel="external "&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/trail.jpeg" alt="trail.jpeg" width="400" height="178"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting bridge across time. There they were, a couple of pre-humans out for a stroll, perhaps on their way to find something for lunch, or strolling off to urinate, probably nothing dramatic, and these few footprints were left in drying mud to be found over a million years later, when they would be scanned with a laser, digitized, and analyzed with sophisticated software, and then uploaded to a digital network where everyone in the world can take a look at them. Something so ephemeral can be translated across incomprehensible ages…I don’t know about you, but I’m wondering about the possible future fate of the debris of my life that has ended up in landfills, or the other small smudges across the landscape that I’ve left behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what have we learned? The analysis has looked at the shape of the foot, the angle of the big toe, the distribution of weight as the hominins walked across the substrate, all the anatomical and physiological details that can be possibly extracted from a few footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:406px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/prints_lg.php" rel="external "&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/prints.jpeg" alt="prints.jpeg" width="400" height="256"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(Click for larger image) Optical laser scan images color-rendered with 5-mm isopleths for footprints at both FwJj14E and GaJi10. (A) Isolated left foot (FUI1) on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E. (B) Photograph of FUI8 on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E, showing good definition of the toe pads; the second toe is partially obscured by the third toe. (C) Second trail on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E, showing two left feet. (D) Third trail on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E, showing a right and a left foot. (E) Print R3 from GaJi10 (22), re-excavated and scanned as part of this investigation. (F) Partial print (FUT1-2) on the upper footprint surface at FwJj14E; the heel area has been removed by a later bovid print. (G) Print FLI1 on the lower footprint surface at FwJj14E, rendered with 5-mm alternating black and white isopleths. (H) Inverted image of the toe area of print FUT1-1 with alternating 5-mm black and white isopleths. Note the locations of the pads of the small toes and the presence of a well-defined ball beneath the hallucial metatarsophalangeal joint. The first, third, and fifth toes are marked D1, D3, and D5, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that these beings walked just like us. The tracks are noticeably different from the even older footprints of australopithecines found at Laetoli, from 3.5 million years ago. The foot shape and the stride of &lt;em&gt;Homo ergaster&lt;/em&gt; was statistically indistinguishable from those of modern humans, even though we know from the bones associated with these species that they were cranially distinct from us. This is not a surprise; it’s been known for a long time that we evolved these bipedal forms long ago, and that the cerebral innovations we regard as so characteristic of humanity are a relative late-comer in our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, these are &lt;em&gt;1½ million years old&lt;/em&gt;, 250 times older than the age of the earth, according to creationists. That’s a lot of wonder and history and evidence to throw away, but they do it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I tried to get away from blogging about antivaccinationists. I even succeeded for one day. Unfortunately, that was all, because J.B. Handley and his crew of antivaccine loons cooked up a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;really big, really deceptive, and really desperate gambit&lt;/a&gt; that just couldn't go unremarked upon. Thus was I sucked back in again. Even worse, this all came hot on the heels of a very sad time in the lives of my wife and myself. I needed something to lift my spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And nothing lifts one's spirits quite like fine, grade-A woo.&lt;/p&gt;

Research Suggests A Broader Definition May Be Needed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The strange interaction of a parasitic wasp, the caterpillar in which it lays its eggs and a virus that helps it overcome the caterpillar's immune defenses has some scientists rethinking the definition of a virus. In an essay in the journal Science, Donald Stoltz, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and James Whitfield, a professor of entomology at the University of Illinois, report that a new study also appearing in Science shows how the diverse ways in which viruses operate within and among the organisms they encounter may not be fully appreciated. The study, from a team of researchers led by the Université François Rabelais, in Tours, France, found that the genes that encode a virus that helps wasps successfully parasitize caterpillars are actually integrated into the wasps' own chromosomes. These genes, which they show to be related to those from another known group of viruses, are an indivisible part of the wasp's genetic heritage; they are passed down from one generation to another of parasitoid wasps.

&lt;p&gt;While it is not unusual for virus DNA to become embedded in the chromosomes of their hosts, in this case the wasp is not the only "host" of the virus. The viral genes do replicate (copy themselves) inside the wasp (the permanent host), but they actually target - and act upon - the immune system of the caterpillar (a more transient host).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The northward and inland movement of North American birds, confirmed by thousands of citizen-observations, has provided new and powerful evidence that climate change is having a serious impact on natural systems, according to a new report by Audubon (BirdLife in the USA). The findings signal the need for dramatic policy changes to combat pervasive ecological disruption.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first is a collection of fossils of Australopithecus amanensis found in Ethiopia. This is a significant find because it fills in a previous gap in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big picture that we have so far is that human ancestors split from chimp ancestors about &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news9211.html"&gt;5-7 million years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and seem to have quickly become bipedal after they diverged.  One candidate for the earliest fossil species on the human line is &lt;a href="http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/ardipithecusramidus.htm"&gt;Ardipithecus ramidis&lt;/a&gt;, which dates to about 4.4 million years ago. Fossil remains of this species are scant, but they appear to have had a dentition more similar to apes like chimps than to later hominids. They also have derived characteristic homologous with Australopithecines and cranial bones suggesting that the skull rested vertically on top of the spinal column, suggesting they were bipedal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next genus thought to be in the line that lead to humans is Australopithecus. These include the famous Lucy specimen that is an incredibly intact fossil. Australopithecines were clearly bipedal, although less adapted to bipedalism than humans, and have other features nicely transitional from non-human apes to humans. The oldest Australopithecus is an afarensis from 3.4 million years ago. Hence the gap from 3.4 to 4.4 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fossils are from an older species in the genus Australopithecus, called anamensis and dates to 4.1 million years ago. This nicely fits in the gap between afarensis and ramidis. Even better, anamensis is anatomically transition between the two - more primitive that afarensis but with derived Australopithecine characteristics not seen in ramidis. An better still, all three species exist in the same place. So we have a temporal and morphological sequence in the same geographic region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is compelling evidence that these three species represent an actual evolutionary sequence. However, the case is far from closed on that question. This is merely the most straightforward interpretation of the data. Evolutionary sequences, however, tend to be complex and bushy. So it is possible that amanensis and afarensis are not in a line but are separate branches from ramidis, or even from a yet undiscovered ancestor. We have too few specimens to say with any confidence what the ultimate relationship among these various species will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, whether these species are in an actual sequence or are side branches, there existence is still powerful evidence for the evolution of humans from ape common ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next new bit of evidence is also very cool - a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7913375.stm"&gt;hominid footprint from 1.5 million years ago&lt;/a&gt;.  Footprints are great evidence because they preserve the soft-tissue anatomy of the foot in a way that bones along cannot. They also give functional information - for example they are more direct evidence for bipedality.These new footprints are probably from a Homo erectus- a probable human ancestor that was fully upright and bipedal (hence the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new footprint, found in Kenya, shows a foot that has an arch similar to human feet and a big toe in a very modern position. By contrast, the oldest hominid footprint, found in Laetoli Tanzania, is probably from an Australopithecus afarensis and dates to 3.7 million years ago. This footprint shows a more flat structure and a big toe that is still angled out to the side - more adapted for grasping than bipedality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool and cooler.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result there are not that many ‘classics’ in the field, since their content is becomes less relevant. The medical aphorism is that 10 years after graduation from medical school, half of everything you learned will no longer be valid. The problem for medical students is trying to figure out which half of their curriculum is not worth learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old studies become increasingly irrelevant as diagnosis and treatment changes over time under the relentless pressure of medicine. I once came across the best of Osler, with his descriptions of typhoid fever and pneumococcal pneumonia. The essays were far more literary in style than todays journal articles, describing the presentation of these diseases in Dickens’ like detail, but of little practical help given the advances in treatment and the understanding of microbiology of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology also expands and limits what papers are available. If there is not an electronic form of an article, it might as well not exist. Many classic articles are not yet available in digital form, and the article in question for this post I had to get as a scanned version of the original paper, rather than a pdf. As a result of time and lack of electronic access, much of the older medical literature is not easily accessible, and journal publishers are not particularly interested in the free dissemination of information. Which is a shame. There is the occasional older references that is as applicable today as when it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was never, to the best of my recollection, a time when I was not a skeptic. But there was a time when I had neither the time nor the knowledge to be able to think skeptically about medicine. The torrent of information that needs to be assimilated in medical school, residency and the first part of fellowship makes reflection about that information almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do remember an article that was a turning point in my thinking about thinking about the practice of medicine. It was 1989 and the last year of my Fellowship and was published in the American Journal of Medicine, entitled “Observations on spiraling empiricism: its causes, allure, and perils, with particular reference to antibiotic therapy” by Kim and Gallis (hence forth called OOSE, pronounced, I suppose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can scrounge up a copy, by all means do so, as it is a classic. It is a collection of logical fallacies and critical thinking as applied to infectious diseases. It was the first time I read an article that discussed how to think about thinking in medicine. I had no idea that there were logical fallacies. Most of what passed for critical thinking in my training concerned understanding the statistics and the materials &amp;amp; methods of studies. Important, but limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOSE starts with a description of the discovery of antibiotics and the amazement of physicians that for the first time diseases that were often fatal were now curable. It must have been an amazing time for physicians when infections that routinely killed were suddenly vanquished. I have witnessed a similar revolution with the advent of HAART, where AIDS has gone from a 9 month life expectancy to a chronic disease with perhaps a normal life expectancy.   At my hospital is Dr. Charles Grossman, now in his 90’s and still attending conferences. His long and productive medical career started at Boston Hospital where, as an intern, he was involved in giving the first iv dose of penicillin to a lady who was dying of a streptococcal infection, who survived another 50 years (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics have been developed to kill increasingly resistant and virulent bacteria, and until recently we have managed to keep one step ahead of the organisms. Unfortunately, the ability to become resistant is outstripping out ability to develop new agents and we are slowly, and inexorably, losing the battle, sliding in to the post antibiotic era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the evolution of resistance occurs from the inappropriate use antibiotics, which can often be due to uncertainly of the diagnosis. But inappropriate antibiotic use can also due to faulty thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors of OOSE note, “The imprecision of clinical practice establishes context, the litigious nature of our society unnerves; the absence of toxicity permits; and the sum of these encourages the incontinent, extemporaneous use of these antimicrobial agent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incontinent use of antibiotics leads to increasing bacterial resistance,and the use of antibiotics when they have not been needed has accelerated the evolution of pathogens, occasionally to the point where there are infections I cannot cure and bacteria that I cannot kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The term spiraling empiricism describes the inappropriate treatment, or the unjustifiable escalation of treatment, of suspected but undocumented infectious diseases. Empiricism and empirical therapy, defined as the carefully considered, presumptive treatment of disease prior to the establishment of a diagnosis, often are necessary in the proper practice of medicine. On the other hand, ill-considered or inappropriate use of antibiotics, incurring unnecessary risk and expense, should be indicted and condemned, The difficulty like in distinguishing reasonable or appropriate from unreasonable or inappropriate therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teaching physician in a teaching hospital, I notice that sometimes it is the FUD, Fear Uncertainty and Doubt, combined with faulty thinking that sometimes leads to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOSE provide a conceptual framework for approaching diseases and potential therapy (see table below); Observation, prophylaxis, empirical, therapeutic trial, and specific therapy. Of these, the first and the last, are, sadly, the least used. For interns and resident, the motto is ‘Don’t just stand there, do something’, and with the pressures to shorten hospital stay as much as possible, simply watching the patient is a luxury few can afford. As an experienced physician, I feel much more comfortable with the motto, ‘Don’t just do something, stand there’, or as the paper calls it “masterly inactivity.” As my wife can attest, I am the master of doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific therapy in infectious diseases is not as common as I would like given the vagaries of growing the infecting organisms and the degree to which one wants to maximize diagnostic certainty. I could probably get the etiology of every pneumonia admitted to the hospital with an open lung biopsy, but it would hardly be worth the resultant morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time the patient is ill enough to be admitted to the hospital and, after appropriate studies and cultures are done, empiric therapy is started. That is often not an unreasonable course of action. These days you have to be ill to get admitted and it is the rare patient who comes into the hospital who can wait for cultures to be positive before beginning antibiotics. I cannot emphasize enough how ill patients are when they are admitted to the hospital, and how unclear the proper diagnosis can be at the beginning of a hospitalization. After a day or two all the diagnostic information has returned and the, with the 20:20 vision of hindsight, the correct diagnosis may become clear and as a result the proper course of therapy is clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since cultures are often negative, the empiric course of therapy may morphs into a therapeutic trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting the therapeutic framework in place, OOSE proceeds, with case reports, to describe fallacies in antibiotic therapy that lead to the wrong therapeutic interventions. There is, in medicine, a long tradition of using cases as illustrative of problems, but not as anecdotal evidence for the proof of a hypothesis. We all remember concepts when they are applied to specific patients and specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their Fallacies in Antibiotic Therapy are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broader is better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure to respond is failure to cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in doubt, change or add another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sickness requires immediate treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Response implies diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bigger disease, bigger drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bigger disease, newer drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antibiotics are non-toxic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will add my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once started, an antibiotic cannot be stopped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a class of antibiotic is started, you need to stay in class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotta double cover (i.e. give two antibiotics) a particular organism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The primary reason a particular antibiotic is given is  “I like it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not repeat the OOSE case studies as examples to support his fallacies, but instead will make comments and substitute my own examples. These fallacies are used a minority of the time, but it is not common to explicitly discuss the ways in which medical reasoning can go wrong in the context of faulty thinking. These fallacies are not unique to Infectious Diseases, and I am sure a neurologist or oncologic surgeon could generate a similar list in their own specialty. I doubt, however, that the same could be said of a chiropractor, naturopath, or homeopath. Perhaps one will prove me wrong in the comments, but logical fallacies are the sine qua non of alternative medicine. They are parallels and subsets of the standard logical fallacies beloved by skeptics everywhere. They are examples of the endless number of ways we can all think inaccurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader is better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad spectrum means an antibiotic that covers every conceivable pathogen. For most infections, the potential causes are often few in number, based on the history and potential exposures. You will always be surprised by the unexpected positive culture and any therapy will have gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents do not want to be accused of not covering some particular organism if it turns out that one of the patients with an odd organism growing in their blood. So they give antibiotics that kill everything, adding expense and driving resistance without necessarily improving care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to respond is failure to cover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few infections get better immediately, and some will be symptomatic for days. Staphylococcal endocarditis will have fever for up to 2 weeks, and often the reason a patient does not respond is not because they are on the wrong or inadequate antibiotic but it is either the natural history of the disease under treatment or, more often, there is a need to drain some pus. The old aphorisms “Nothing heals like cold steel” and “A chance to cut is a chance to cure,” remain as true today as they did in the pre antibiotic area. One of my colleagues does an impression of me when I am 85 and demented in a nursing home, banging my hand on the table, shouting over and over “drain the pus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding antibiotics may add only cost, potential toxicity and accelerate resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When in doubt, change or add another antibiotic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine is filled with uncertainty, and often it is the case that if an infection is thought of, it is treated, no matter how unlikely it is that it may be causing the disease. I have a fantasy where oncology is practiced like infectious disease. “It might be lymphoma, so lets start with CHOP, but we don’t want to miss adenocarcinoma, so lets add bleomycin, and in case its breast cancer we need to include tamoxifen and if could be prostrate so lets add etc , etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, increase your diagnostic certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sickness requires immediate treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t. It depends on the patient and how clinically stable they are. All too often, people receive therapy for diseases that do not need antibiotics or the antibiotics are given before a firm diagnosis is made. This is driven, in part, by CMS core measurements. Community acquired pneumonia guidelines mandated that antibiotics be given within 4 hours of the presentation to the ER, if not the hospital gets a demerit. The result? Perhaps 1 in five patients who get treatment for pneumonia did not turn out to have pneumonia and would have benefited from watching and waiting (3). No good deed ever goes unpunished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers appear to be particularly hesitant to not treat a fever with antibiotics. I like to say, antibiotics are not antipyretics, if you want to treat a fever, give Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response implies diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most difficult fallacy for people to abandon. Patient has a fever, no diagnosis is evident, but the fever went away at some point after the institution of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most fevers go away. Many diseases that are not infectious will have a fever. This is the medical equivalent of the skeptical motto ‘association is not causation’. The worst cognitive error physicians and patients make is the assumption, the Rigorously absence of a good diagnosis, that the improvement when a therapy is given is due to the therapy. Rigorously and consciously avoiding this error is key to being a good health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger disease, bigger drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRSA is a current bane of Infectious diseases. It is a bug that I cannot always kill with the current antibiotics, and the three or four antibiotics to which the organism is susceptible are all equally bad. So, when there is a severe MRSA pneumonia, the urge is to add rifampin, even though the data to support its use is problematic at best. But if one drug is good, are not two better? Perhaps. Sometimes combining antibiotics may be antagonistic and decrease the efficacy of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger disease, newer drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course newer is better. New and improved. It is as American as Procter and Gamble. Not necessarily. For MSSA, there are no better drugs than nafcillin or cefazolin, and the newer agents are less efficacious in head to head trials. However, newer drugs are heavily advertised and detailed, &amp;lt;sarcasm&amp;gt; not that any physician would ever be swayed by advertisements instead of data &amp;lt;/sarcasm&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antibiotics are non-toxic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All drugs have side effects, some common, some rare. Certainly antibiotics are less toxic than cancer chemotherapy agents, but they do have to potential to cause significant harm. We all have our irrational beliefs. Here is mine. Besides believing in critical thinking. The chance of an adverse reaction in inversely related to the need for the antibiotic. So if the patient has little need for the antibiotic, then the chance of an adverse effect is almost 100%. I know that it is not true, but some days the universe sure seems to conspire to function as if it were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some antibiotics are a big gun, are strong, or powerful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few things in medicine with 100% sensitivity and specificity. However, if your health care provider uses the adjectives big gun, strong, or powerful in reference to an antibiotic, they are either 1) talking out their backside or 2) ignorant about antibiotic use. 100% sensitive and specific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had neurosyphilis, and there are those who suspect I do, the ‘strong’ or ‘powerful’ ciprofloxicin would do nothing to treat my infection, put ancient, weak old penicillin remains the treatment of choice. What you want is to give are appropriate antibiotics: something that will reliably kill the organisms in whatever space is infected. These adjectives are advertising ploys used on fool gullible rubes, er, I mean health care providers, to think they are doing what is best for their patient. They provide a false security that you are giving the patient the best therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once started, an antibiotic cannot be stopped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have trouble stopping an antibiotic even when the cultures come back suggesting particular therapy is not needed. A patient comes in septic and antibiotics are begun. Even when it turns out that the blood grows a penicillin sensitive &lt;em&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, the multiple initial empiric antibiotics may be continued. One of my colleagues only half jokingly says the reason she consults me is to have me stop the antibiotics. When there is reasonable data to suggest that shorter courses of antibiotics are no better than longer, the endless allure of 10, the number of fingers, or 14, twice two weeks, is often the default duration of therapy. I once saw a patient who had been on IV vancomycin for 6 months for osteomyelitis of the foot; the provider just couldn’t bring themselves to stop the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once a class of antibiotic is started, you need to stay in class.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a patient is admitted with an infection and started on an intravenous quinolone and grows something than can be treated with a less expensive, narrower spectrum agent like amoxicillin, at discharge the patient is likely to go home on an expense oral quinolone. They responded to a class of antibiotics, and so it needs to be continued, even if the cultures say otherwise. Magical thinking, as best I can tell, and one that I occasionally participate in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gotta double cover (i.e. give two antibiotics) a particular organism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a persisting myth that some infections, like Pseudomonas, always require two antibiotics. That is true occasionally, but for most cases a single antibacterial is no worse than two, and the more antibiotics you give the more you increase the toxicity’s and the faster you drive antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The primary reason a particular antibiotic is given is that “I like it.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to say that the three most dangerous words in medicine, especially when it comes to therapeutic interventions, are “In my experience.” In my experience you can’t trust anyone who uses that phrase. Remembering hits and forgetting misses drives antibiotic use more than I would like to admit. Infectious disease docs are sometimes the opposite. We put too much emphasis on the antibiotics that have failed us in the past. It is o e extreme or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient is admitted with a complicated infection and started on X. Why X? I ask. It worked for me in the past is the reply. What are you trying to kill? I might then ask. Often, they say the boogie man of the ICU, Pseudomonas. What I will continue, is the chance drug X will be effective against Pseudomonas? They don’t know. So why again are you using X? It is what we do. They have used it successfully in the past, so it should work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most drugs work most of the time in most patients, but that rule is slowly being lost as the organisms become increasingly resistant to our current armamentarium of antibiotics and there are few, if any, replacements in the pipeline. At my institution there is 2% resistance for Pseudomonas to Ceftazadime and 4% to pipercillin/tazobactam. We get a few cases a year at best of a blood stream infection and sepsis from Pseudomonas. Most physicians are not going to see enough infections by a given organism to get a sense of what does and does not work. It is why you cannot trust your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not yet read the book “How Doctors Think” although being in a teaching hospital I try, however poorly, to demonstrate how I think about thinking about infections. I often give the residents on service a copy of the article on which this post is based. Once, when I was ranting about this at a conference, one of the attendees said I was an arrogant subspecialty who didn’t understand the pressures faced by general internists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know. Perhaps they are right. But often getting the right diagnosis and therapy is less about what you know and more about being rigorous about understanding how you know. Only when you are conscious of your ability to think poorly, can you compensate. In the era of Google, any knowledge gap is a search away, but you have to be aware of the knowledge gap first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish quoting this under-read and under-appreciated article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…fashion and marketing forces, not science, shape clinical practice. Within an intensive are unit, gravity of illness amplifies the effects of delay and presses for preemptive, urgent empiricism, but the selection and manipulation of therapy can sometimes be justly criticized. The intensive care unit mentality, which treats all illness as life-threatening, favors therapy over careful consideration of diagnostic maneuvers… The potential for, and tendency toward, spiraling (as opposed to appropriate) empiricism appears disturbingly pervasive- reinforced by fashion, compensation, and litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, but driven more by the urge to help people get better and the fear of doing harm by missing an infection. OOSE does overstate the problem, but such is the nature of polemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Osler’s comment that the ‘practice of medicine is an art, based on science’ underscores the dichotomy and the dilemma, of medical science. Empiric therapy at its best is set between the Scylla of unnecessary delay and the Charybdis of therapeutic voyeurism. Knowledge of the science of medicine and the natural history of disease should temper and compliment the art.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was one of the few epiphanies in my medical career. I re-read it several times a year and consciously endeavor to keep it’s concepts in the front of my thought processes. It stays fresh with each reading, because my capacity to think badly is limitless and only by constantly reminding myself of that fact can I hope not to stray into illogic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of applying the art of medicine is to recognize the fallacies of medical thinking and to question your decisions and interventions in the light of understanding yourself and how you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bumper sticker “Don’t believe everything you think” should be a motto for all health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;

February is the last month in the ancient Roman calendar, with March the first. March---spring---is when the farmer can return to plow his fields and plan the year's harvest (it's also, fittingly---being the month named after Mars, the god of war---when one begins military campaigns). It's been feeling spring-ish around here this past week, with a lightness in the air and the sun shining on Charlie's and my late afternoon walks. It's a welcome change: While the winter was not freezing &lt;em&gt;freezing&lt;/em&gt; cold here in the Garden State, we got our share of snow and the wind always seems to blow down extra frigid on Glenwood Avenue as I run-walk to class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, this year got off to a remarkably difficult start for our family of three, with Jim and I finding some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;hard hard questions&lt;/a&gt;---like the possibility of Charlie needing to be in a residential placement---staring us in the face. Charlie had started to really struggle &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;back in December&lt;/a&gt; on our annual Christmas trip to California and this continued after we returned home to New Jersey. Things got rough, difficult, and really pretty bad, and even reached a crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone---Charlie's teacher most of all, and the aides in the class, and the school district really, and  the ABA consultant, and Charlie's neurologist, and Jim and me for sure---and, after a lot of what I'll just call worry, agonizing, and sorrow of the soul-searching kind, changes and a new protocol have been put into place. There's been the inevitable adjustments and bumps---Charlie tends to take to a new program quickly, and then squirm and falter as he gets further into it. Home visits from Charlie's teacher have been highly helpful and we've been feeling that the lines of communication are clear and open, and that honesty and doing the best by Charlie is truly everyone's &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt;. We've been feeling extra-grateful that, this time, our school district has stepped up to provide Charlie with what he needs at a time of budget crisis and when parents elsewhere in the US, in Michigan, are seeking to file a &lt;a href="http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090226/METRO/902260464/1361"&gt;class action lawsuit against Blue Cross-Blue Shield&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/insurance_and_autism_not_just_for_aba"&gt;ABA therapy&lt;/a&gt; for their children. Families in &lt;a href="http://wjz.com/local/Attorney.General.Gansler.2.944645.html"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.durantdemocrat.com/pages/full_story?page_label=home_top_stories_news&amp;amp;id=1998064-Democrats-question-insurance-treatment-coverage-policies&amp;amp;widget=push&amp;amp;article-Democrats-question-insurance-treatment-coverage-policies%20=&amp;amp;instance=secondary_news_left_column&amp;amp;open=&amp;amp;"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; are seeking legislation to have insurance companies cover autism treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February's seen some momentous news on the autismfront, from the announcement of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/manipulated_data_behind_mmr-autism_controversy"&gt;manipulated data&lt;/a&gt; in Dr. Andrew Wakefield's 1998 study, to the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vaccines_and_autism_a_matter_of_the_heart"&gt;Special Masters' rulings&lt;/a&gt; against three families---the Cedillos, the Hazlehursts, and the Snyders---who were seeking compensation from the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; (NVICP). It's also been quite a momentous month here in our household: On Wednesday, Jim mailed in the corrected manuscript for his book about the New Jersey/New York port. It's about the "Irish waterfront" and &lt;a href="http://www.companysj.com/v204/waterfrontpriest.htm"&gt;Fr. John Corridan&lt;/a&gt;, the Jesuit priest who championed the rights of the longshoremen who worked under unfair (understatement) labor conditions in the first part of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jim's book is about the 1954 movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/"&gt;On the Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, in which Marlon Brando plays a coulda-been boxer/longshoreman, Terry Malloy, and Karl Malden is Fr. Pete Barry, a character inspired by Fr. John Corridan. For the past ten or so years, Jim's been in libraries and archives and working through boxes and boxes and boxes of xeroxed documents and testimony from the &lt;a href="http://www.wcnyh.org/history.htm"&gt;Waterfront Crime Commission&lt;/a&gt; and walking on the piers on the west side to piece together the story of the &lt;a href="http://www.companysj.com/v204/waterfrontpriest.htm"&gt;waterfront priest&lt;/a&gt;. In the year that Charlie began ABA therapy in our second-story duplex in St. Paul, Jim was on a sabbatical and between opening the door for the therapists and taking care of Charlie, he worked on the beginnings of his book in a small wedge-shaped room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of Charlie having been the main focus of our lives for these past years, Jim's book has often had to be put it aside. Even though the book is not about anything I write about here, in many ways it feels that it is very much about this past decade of Jim's and Charlie's and my life together---that the story of the Irish waterfront has been a huge part of our story. Times have been tough, though there's been plenty of good and joy, and love in bucketsfull. There's been many moves in the constant effort to find the right school for Charlie (which we seem to have found, for the time being), and strain and anxiety and long nights and sorrowful days. There's never not been struggle and we have been beset. Life on the autismfront has been the real thing, and Hollywood endings are not expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things have been looking up on the docks around here. I've got my senses attuned for the small signs of spring, for newer colors to spot on the trees and in the grass as Charlie and I take our walks, for a softer feel to the wind blowing on us off the Hudson River. &lt;em&gt;Februa&lt;/em&gt; is Latin for "expiation," for purging and purifying and who knows but maybe that has been what was going on this past month. One thing's for sure: Through this past period of adversity, and over a decade plus, we've stayed a tight team of three, more and more aware of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_autism_in_all_of_us"&gt;how much we're like each other&lt;/a&gt;, of what &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/synapses_synesthesia_amp_genes"&gt;brings us together&lt;/a&gt;. We've stuck it out and we're sticking with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, things are looking up.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235723719344"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2349">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25ca9698af9c0050</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="amputee"/><category term="mermaid"/><category term="Nadya Vessey"/><title type="html">See, mermaids are real</title><published>2009-02-27T07:23:22Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T07:23:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/see-mermaids-are-real/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/09_03/mermaidDM1609_228x400.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/09_03/mermaidDM1609_228x400.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="223"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-482130/Real-life-mermaid-double-amputee-gets-fishs-tail.html"&gt;This news story is AWESOME&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double amputee Nadya Vessey will soon be able to swim like a mermaid with a specially-made tail that will let her propel herself through the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keen swimmer is to be fitted with the “mermaid-style” tail made by the same special effects team behind blockbuster Lord of the Rings and King Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord of the Rings and King Kong? Why do I get the feeling this tail is going to be really, really, really unnecessarily LONG?&lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/blog/1019096_islamic-scholar-suggests-using-ethanol-powered-vehicles-may-be-a-sin"&gt;Islamic theologian has declared that using ethanol as a fuel is sinful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if the debate around using ethanol to fuel cars weren't already complicated enough, now an Islamic scholar has suggested that driving or even riding in a vehicle fueled by ethanol could be considered a sin for observant Muslims.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The opinion comes from Sheikh Mohamed al-Najimi, of the Islamic Jurisprudence Academy in Saudi Arabia. It is based on the part of Islamic law derived from a statement by the prophet in which dealing with alcohol in any form--including purchase, sale, transport, consumption, and manufacture--is strictly prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But...but...there are basic biochemical processes going on in every Muslim's body that produce alcohols! If you're going to get this ridiculous about restricting anything that has to do with alcohol, they're going to have to get rid of those sinful dehydrogenases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really…don&amp;#39;t you suspect that this has more to do with Saudi Arabia&amp;#39;s status as an oil producing state than in any kind of genuine piety?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/good_thing_mohammed_never_said.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/IEW5FZ8qFlY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235720278837"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ed20ac8e16859f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Elderly Gun Ban</title><published>2009-02-27T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/elderly.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Will a new executive order severely limit firearms ownership by the elderly?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235718615924"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33112888.post-4927665100386290345">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07f2039ec6ba88e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Professor Carmella’s Psychic Studio</title><published>2009-02-27T00:12:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T00:12:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/2009/02/professor-carmella-psychic-studio.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Magic Darts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235718615923"><id gr:original-id="http://www.apathysketchpad.com/blog/?p=991">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa32ff74f7511d32</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">A Brilliant Argument</title><published>2009-02-26T19:20:43Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T19:20:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.apathysketchpad.com/blog/2009/02/26/a-brilliant-argument/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Watch this video.

Ya gotta love a news story like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pregnant fossil fish at the Natural History Museum in London has shed light on the possible origin of sex, according to a study published today in the journal Nature by an international team including Museum scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossil is an adult placoderm, an extinct group of armoured fish, and it contains a 5cm-long embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is dated to the Upper Devonian period 350 million years ago and was found in the Gogo formation of western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those keeping count, that’s 349,994,000 years before the existence of the entire universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

No, the conspiracy wasn’t that vaccines were linked to autism. The conspiracy was that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirby_and_autism_speaks_sittin_in.php"&gt;David Kirby was linked to Peter Bell of Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; in a coordinated effort to drum up “respectability” for the anti-vaccination movement’s belief that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to support Autism Speaks. I actually donated money to them. Sadly, I now wish to demand a refund considering they took my money under the false pretenses that they gave a shit about promoting real scientific progress regarding autism. My love of Autism Speaks pretty much died the moment I heard that one of their most high-ranking personnel, Alison Singer, resigned her position in disgust. Singer recognized that there was no benefit in holding onto the vaccine hypothesis while Autism Speaks was committed to pushing it as a still viable possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Canada rejects the basic premise that religions have rights; human rights belong to human beings,” said Catherine Loubier, spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The focus (here) should not be on protecting religions, but rather on protecting the rights of the adherents of religions, including of people belonging to religious minorities, or people who may choose to change their religion, or not to practice religion at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is it that we live in a culture where people think it’s safe to have a chimpanzee as a pet? Where do people get the idea that we ought to take a wild animal and treat it like a human being? The chimp owner treated the animal like a son who ate at her table, slept in her house, and even drove her car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the world celebrated Darwin’s 200th birthday. Universities placed tributes to Darwinism on their home page (examples include Oxford and Cambridge) and major networks such as BBC ran extensive programs devoted to Darwin’s great contribution to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, ironically, this week we witness a brutal act that &lt;strong&gt;seems to logically follow&lt;/strong&gt; from Darwin’s ideas. You may be wondering how I can possibly link Darwin to this atrocious event. But think about it, if humans are deeply related to chimps then why not expect them to act that way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…seems to logically follow…” What?! I can’t remember the last time 4 simple words put together revealed such total craziness. This is just too stupid for me to even think of how to respond to it. I’ll &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/in_addition_to_the_holocaust_w.php"&gt;pass it over to PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; to rip on this moron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/02252009/news/regionalnews/pivens_poisonal_plea_156806.htm"&gt;So now he’s going to go before the grievance committee of Actors’ Equity tomorrow to defend himself and his sushi excuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my understanding that he’ll be there - unless he has too much sushi on the plane from LA,” joked a person involved in the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piven is said to have a note from his doctor in the form of a blood test, which allegedly supports his case. But according to the show’s producers, Piven had been taking steps to leave the show prior to complaining of any sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called several prominent actors on his own and begged them to replace him, sources said. He was also overheard telling people backstage that he was “bored out of his mind” in the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The producers also have a record of where Piven’s car and driver took him after performances, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling that the sushi excuse won’t pan out and that Piven’s in some trouble, but we’ll all have to wait and see how this all ends.&lt;/p&gt;

This study was put out by The New England Journal of Medicine. I’ve blogged about this issue before. It’s really nothing new, despite the fact that dozens of books come out each year peddling some other silly weight loss plan. None of them have been shown to actually work. But once again, this new study shows that it’s all about the calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;em&gt;would we miss the moon if it did not exist? I’m not asking what crazy improbable situation would be needed to remove the moon, just what the observable differences upon the Earth would be if there was no moon? Obviously there would be tidal differences, but would we have any other major effects I’m not aware of?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt A.&lt;br&gt;
Minneapolis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the question Matt, This was a fun topic to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more ramifications from a missing moon than you might realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you’re correct that there would be tidal differences but the details may surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fist of all, the tides wouldn’t disappear. Everyone usually associates the moon with the tides but the sun contributes as well. These sun-only tides would be smaller of course; in fact they’d be about one third as high as they are today. They would also be very simplified as well, consisting of just a high tide and a low tide with no variation. This is because neap tides and spring tides would disappear since there would no longer be any moon to add to or subtract from the sun’s tidal influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Matt wanted to know the observable differences if the moon disappeared, I am creating an Observable Difference Factor scale from 0 - 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;–is easily observable by anyone not in a vegetative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;–is noticeable only by very alert scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0–&lt;/strong&gt;is not noticeable at all even by a post-singularity super-intelligent AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give the tides an Observable Difference Factor of 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live or work near the coast and have a fully functional parietal lobe you will notice that the tides have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="The no-moon scenario" src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/moon2.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="337"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth’s Spin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that a day on earth billions of years ago was only 6 hours long? Talk about days flying by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geologists know this by counting the growth rings in 400-million-year-old coral fossils and 3-billion-year-old stromatolites. Our days have been steadily lengthening because of a fascinating phenomenon call tidal breaking.    The huge high-tide bulge of water closest to the moon is never right under the moon because the earth’s spin is moving it away.  Gravity pulls the moon towards the bulge which speeds the moon up forcing it into a higher orbit. The bulge is also attracted to the moon so it tries to move toward it which is in a direction opposite to earth’s rotation. This increased friction slows the earth down. A more technical way to look at it is conservation of angular momentum. The total angular momentum of the earth/moon system must remain the same. The moon gains angular momentum as it moves away; therefore the earth must lose it to maintain this zero-sum game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line then is that if the moon disappeared, the lengthening of our days would greatly slow down. It would still occur though due to tidal breaking caused by the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give this an Observable Difference Factor of 1.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists would notice this easily but some regular people would also notice that leap seconds stopped occurring every two years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Axis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture the two dimensional path the earth takes around the sun. Now picture the axis upon which the earth spins. There is not a 90 degree angle between these lines. If that was the case, the earth would be a seasonless world. It is because the earth is tilted 23 1/2 degrees away from 90 degrees that I have to endure this bitterly cold winter for many months before spring-summer-fall arrives to reset my sanity back to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/axis.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="303"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take this angle for granted don’t we? It’s easy to think that this angle is fixed at the birth of the solar system and stays that way. It turns out though that our moon is a great axis of rotation stabilizer. Without it, the earth’s axis could potentially swing from 5 degrees to 40 degrees based on the various gravitational interactions with the other planets. Imagine what this would do to our weather and evolution. For those of you more into short-term thinking, you wouldn’t have to hold on to anything were this to happen.  This wobble could take thousands or hundreds of thousands of years to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give this an Observable Difference Factor of 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only scientists (and cloaked alien satellites) would notice this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oceanic Redistribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other significant effect I could find has to do with the altitude of the water in our oceans. Apparently, without the moons gravity, the water in our oceans would migrate a certain extent from the equator to the polar regions. It was unclear from my research how dramatic this effect would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give this an Observable Difference Factor of somewhere between 5 and 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion seems to beg the question of what would the earth be like today if it never formed the moon in the first place after that Mars-sized object slammed into the early earth (imagine seeing that coming?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into detail but I’d like to briefly address the likely result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Earth day now would only be 8 hours long due to the isolated effects of  sun-earth tidal breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A faster spinning earth would likely have horrific winds. Daily winds could reach 100 mph and hurricane winds would be quite nasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution would be greatly impacted but it still would have occurred I believe. Life seems so tenacious and seems to have started as soon as it was possible but humans certainly wouldn’t be here if the moon never was. It seems likely that at the very least evolution would have been delayed or slowed greatly. With no moon there would be no mountainous tides early in earth history to scour the land every few hours and bring back to the primordial soup the critical chemical ingredients of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sit here contemplating these changes I am also grateful for some moon-based words that I would miss if they disappeared with the moon like lunatic and mooning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235712101279"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_methods_its_good_to_blo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4b86a1ee631dbc3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><title type="html">Nature Methods: It's good to blog</title><published>2009-02-27T05:13:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T05:13:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/g0_fKadjHxo/nature_methods_its_good_to_blo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_methods_its_good_to_blo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another editorial about science blogging today, this time in Nature Methods: &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v6/n3/full/nmeth0309-181.html" title=""&gt;Lines of communication&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The public likes science stories it can easily relate to, and we have to admit that most science, including that published in Nature Methods, is unlikely to get more than a snore from nonscientists. In contrast, science stories that have a human interest or other emotionally charged angle require the concerted efforts of both journalists and scientists to ensure that the public understands the story well enough to make an informed personal decision. A failure in this regard can lead to a crisis that is difficult to resolve.

&lt;p&gt;-------snip----------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A powerful aspect of blogs is their capacity to put a human face on science and related health issues by allowing scientists to discuss how these things affect them personally in a format in which regular readers feel as though they know the writer. Analysis of the MMR vaccine incident suggests that emotional arguments like a scientist talking about vaccinating his or her own children might be more powerful than the rational arguments that form the basis of normal scientific discourse. The public's emotional response to genetically modified food in some countries might also have been very different if people could see numerous online blog entries from scientists discussing why they were not concerned about the scenarios being promulgated in the press. But can enough scientists be convinced of the potential benefits of blogging to make this a reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences such as Science Blogging 2008: London, organized by Nature Network, and &lt;b&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/b&gt; are exploring the role of blogging in science and trying to get more scientists involved. Nature Network just concluded their Science Blogging Challenge 2008--won by Russ B. Altman--where the goal was to get a senior scientist to start blogging. Altman's colleague Steve Quake also just started blogging in a guest stint for the New York Times. One hopes that examples of prominent scientists blogging will convince others of the benefits. When a blog author is not a prominent scientist with a reputation to maintain, the quality of information on the blog can be a concern, but scienceblog tracking sites such as http://blogs.nature.com/ can help alleviate this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;w00t for the mention of ScienceOnline09! I wish they also mentioned ResearchBlogging.org as a means to track good science blogging (mention of carnivals would be too much to expect from a short article like this, I understand).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the spirit of leading by example, Nature Methods will convert its online commenting site, Methagora, into a proper blog in preparation for later this year when &lt;b&gt;commenting capabilities will be incorporated into published papers&lt;/b&gt;. Methagora will allow us to highlight and comment on papers that we feel are of interest to a larger readership and discuss the impact we see them having on science and hopefully society. We invite you, our readers--scientists and nonscientists alike--to share your thoughts and concerns, including your thoughts on this editorial. See you in the blogosphere!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to hear this.  I guess the &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2009/02/commenting_on_scientific_artic.html" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; example is emboldening others to start the experiment as well.  This is a Good Thing. More journals allow the commenting on the papers, more 'normal' this will appear to scientist, more quickly it will become normal for scientists to use this.  You remember when Nature tried this experiment a couple of years ago, then quit and proclaimed the experiment to be a failure after only six months? When they did that, I was, like, WTF? Who ever expected such a big shift in the entire scientific culture to happen in six months?! But give it another five years and it will start getting there. And remember that a scientific paper is not a blog post - do not expect a bunch of comments over the first 24 hours: they will slowly accumulate over the years and decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me just notice that both Nature and Nature Methods &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_its_good_to_blog.php" title=""&gt;published pro-blog editorials&lt;/a&gt; on the same day. And they also interviewed me this week for a topical issue on the state of science journalism/communication they are planning for a couple of weeks from now. I don't think this is a coincidence - Nature group is cooking something and we'll have to wait and see what that is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/nature_methods_its_good_to_blo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/g0_fKadjHxo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235712101278"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/how_todays_kids_do_homework.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69d2de18f89123ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Education"/><title type="html">How today's kids do homework</title><published>2009-02-27T04:03:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T04:03:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/fjHJbdHMsDw/how_todays_kids_do_homework.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/how_todays_kids_do_homework.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My son had to do a homework for his Biology class, a kinda stupid long worksheet.  He was given a bunch of DNA sequences (and had the codon table handy) and needed to translate that into amino acid sequences.  The a.a. sequence spells out a sentence. Busy-work, if anyone asks me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he was too lazy to do it by hand, so he wrote a little program to do it for him: type in DNA sequence, click OK, out comes the a.a. sequence. He sent his teacher both the answers and the program....just goes to show that doing this homework does not require a brain capable of reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are gazillions of programs out there that do the same thing and more, but he did not know that at the time, and anyway, that was quite ingenious, methinks.

One of those commentators, Juliet Schor, recommends eating less meat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rosamond Naylor, a researcher at Stanford, estimates that U.S. meat production is especially grain intensive, requiring 10 times the grain required to produce an equivalent amount of calories than grain, Livestock production, which now covers 30 percent of the world's non-ice surface area, is also highly damaging to soil and water resources.

&lt;p&gt;Compared to producing vegetables or rice, beef uses 16 times as much energy and produces 25 times the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A study on U.S. consumption from the University of Chicago estimates that if the average American were to reduce meat consumption by just 20 percent, that would be the equivalent of switching from driving a Camry to a Prius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans currently rank second in world in meat consumption, weighing in at 271 pounds a year, up from 196 pounds 40 years ago. And that doesn't include dairy. We get an estimated 75 grams of protein a day from animals, and 110 grams total; the government recommends only 50 grams a day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of eating lower on the food chain to save the planet isn't a new one.  However, this isn't a suggestion that helps the Free-Ride household reduce its environmental impact, since we are already meatless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, figuring out how to tweak our dietary choices to further reduce our impact is made difficult by the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/08/doing_the_math_how_plausible_i.php"&gt;lack of transparency&lt;/a&gt; about the real environmental costs of our options.  The labels in the supermarket don't list how much water, land, or petroleum-based fertilizer went into producing your pound of potatoes or peas.  Nor do they reflect the amount of energy used to process your tofu, nor the natural resources to can you chickpeas, nor the fuel to ship your bananas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of which makes it very hard to know how to make better choices about the foods we eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/looking_for_data_to_make_envir.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/looking_for_data_to_make_envir.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/5b9DMkSeBVI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235710252012"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4174">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23b53cc69fac1bad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Legal Issues" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Manufactroversy" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="iowa" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Iowa"/><category term="academicfreedom" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="academic freedom"/><category term="creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="creationism"/><category term="intelligentdesign" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="intelligent design"/><title type="html">Anti-evolution bill in Iowa</title><published>2009-02-27T04:48:53Z</published><updated>2009-02-27T04:48:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/anti-evolution.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so incredibly tardy with this information that Arizonian &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/2009/02/iowa_faculty_on_the_evolution.php" rel="external "&gt;John Lynch&lt;/a&gt; and the lovely folks at &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/statement-by-iowa-faculty-on-hf-183-the-evolution-academic-freedom-act/" rel="external "&gt;Uncommon Descent&lt;/a&gt; have already blogged this, but recently an &lt;a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=billinfo&amp;amp;Service=Billbook&amp;amp;ga=83&amp;amp;hbill=HF183" rel="external "&gt;“academic freedom” bill&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in Iowa.  For those who may be unfamiliar, in addition to “teach the controversy,” these “academic freedom” bills are one of the new tactics for creationists who want to introduce creationism into science classrooms via the back door by claiming that teachers need the protection to teach “the full range of scientific views” when it comes to evolution (in other words, to teach creationism/ID).  The bill states that:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore the intent of the general assembly that this Act be construed to expressly protect the affirmative right and freedom of every instructor at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary level to objectively present scientific information relevant to the full range of scientific views regarding biological and chemical evolution in connection with teaching any prescribed curriculum regarding chemical or biological evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As John notes, we’ve circulated a petition showing opposition to the bill (this was covered Wednesday in &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/temp/email2.php?id=hrksmsv3vKxM8rpwbx2skBXcf8zczzh8" rel="external "&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;), and the latest word is that &lt;a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/article/20090226/NEWS01/90226004/1079" rel="external "&gt;the bill is unlikely to get anywhere&lt;/a&gt;.  (Fellow blogger &lt;a href="http://johnlogsdon.blogspot.com/" rel="external "&gt;John Logsdon&lt;/a&gt; had a few choice quotes in the article).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first anti-evolution bill in Iowa in roughly a decade, and according to Glenn Branch at the NCSE (quoted in The Chronicle article), the first state-wide effort by college faculty to organize opposition to these bills.  So far, similar bills died in Mississippi and Oklahoma, were signed into law in Louisiana, and are still pending here in Iowa and in Missouri, Alabama, and New Mexico.

No more blasphemy for us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least a Canadian spokesman has the right idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canada rejects the basic premise that religions have rights; human rights belong to human beings," said Catherine Loubier, spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The focus (here) should not be on protecting religions, but rather on protecting the rights of the adherents of religions, including of people belonging to religious minorities, or people who may choose to change their religion, or not to practice religion at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Hitchens also makes strong points (you'll have to listen to the odious Lou Dobbs to hear him, unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;

And it is a good thing for people who actually want to acquire those life skills, or for whom acquiring those life skills is a good choice.  As a reader was quick to comment however, getting someone else to perform or assist with these life tasks may be a better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I wrote in an exchange with a primary school autism specialist, "The thing that baffles me is that with typical kids people use their talents and strengths while supporting their weaknesses and embracing their individuality, so why do people not do the same with kids who are wired a bit differently?  Why does the focus then suddenly go to focusing on the weaknesses and avoiding the strengths and seeing the differences as a pathology instead of as an individual to be embraced?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Smith wrote &lt;a href="http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=40"&gt;What's An Accommodation?&lt;/a&gt; that does a tidy job of pointing out the way that society works to support the weaknesses of the majority--so much so that people fail to recognize that they are in fact having their disabilities supported.  Smith's example is that because most people lack the ability to be auto mechanics, they hire those who do have those skills to fix their cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a recent presentation of mine regarding teaching "life skills" in a public education setting, "Sometimes it may be appropriate to just assist a student or substitute a requirement, especially in the case where the student does not have sufficient executive function or motor skills for the task. Remember, some of us may need help with these sorts of tasks for the rest of our lives. Don't make us feel bad about that, instead, let us really soar at the things we can do well.  After all, if one is making millions as a software tycoon, one can hire someone else to make the bed." (last sentence intended as a joke)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just a matter of "can't do task"--sometimes it is a matter of "shouldn't do task."  When I try to manage daily living skills I end up exhausted and feeling feel terrible about myself.  But when I can spend my time engaged in skilled work in science and the arts I end up invigorated and feeling good about myself.  Is "independence" in daily living for me worth the price?  &lt;em&gt;Is&lt;/em&gt; a life spent only on grinding drudgery and relentless pounding on weakness with no hope of reaching one's true potential even "independence" at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating out which parts of my life would be improved with skills training versus which parts of my life would be improved by having a support person assist is still a "work in progress" for me.  Before assuming that improved life skills are a good thing for a person on the spectrum, it's important to consider whether there would truly be an increase in quality of life--or if it's just trying to force someone with no head for motors and engineering and a hatred of grease to work on their own automobile engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options for getting daily living needs met need to be available, accessible, and based on what the individual themself wants.  There is no "&lt;a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/one-size-fits-all"&gt;one size fits all.&lt;/a&gt;"  And no matter what option is taken, access issues for adults remain.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235692492539"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7686531224717153978">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27d02958f1e68097</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Nobel Prize" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Nobel Laureate: Kary Mullis</title><published>2009-02-26T23:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T23:49:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/nobel-laureate-kary-mullis.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7686531224717153978/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7686531224717153978" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1993.&amp;quot;for contributions to the developments of methods within DNA-based chemistry: for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method&amp;quot;Kary B.

In a &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_11613034"&gt;February 2nd interview, Skelly said&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"It's just not possible for the average kid who comes to this country in seventh or eighth grade, or even third grade, without a word of English and parents with little formal education, to match the achievement levels of kids whose mom has a Ph.D. in English from Stanford and can afford to stay home and spend time supplementing the education of her kids."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Skelly got in a lot of hot water for those comments, and issued an &lt;a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=11175"&gt;apology eight days later.&lt;/a&gt;

Peter Fortenbaugh, the Executive Director of &lt;a href="http://www.bgcp.org/"&gt;Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of the Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
Dr. Skelly is right&lt;/strong&gt; when he says that schools alone cannot close the achievement gap. We must look beyond the schools, teachers and curriculum. We first need to understand the different worlds in which students grow up in and the different opportunities available to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fortenbaugh went on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we truly want to close the achievement gap, we need to address social-policy issues beyond education. We need to invest in programs that partner with schools to provide opportunities for all of our students after school and during summers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible, we are finding out, to reduce the achievement gap while the opportunity gap is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Aimée, writing at &lt;a href="http://www.svmoms.com/2009/02/draftcan-schools-close-the-achievement-gap.html"&gt;Silicon Valley Moms' Blog,&lt;/a&gt; observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While we all like to cling to the idea that education is the great equalizer, the truth is education can do a lot, but it can't do everything.... I think Kevin Skelly and Peter Fortenbaugh are right on the mark with all of their comments. &lt;strong&gt;It is ridiculous to think that 6 or so hours in school 188 days of the year could make up for all of the differences between low income and higher income students&lt;/strong&gt;. When low income students come to school having had a full night's rest in a safe neighborhood, a breakfast that includes high-quality protein with fresh fruit available at a local store, a quiet place to do their homework and parents who can answer or access data to answer the student's questions about schoolwork and life, then we can look to the schools and the teachers to make up the rest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'm tutoring in two schools -- one a private school, with high-income students, often with both parents with advanced degrees; the other a public school where the students are largely low-income and English language learners.  The fifth-grade private school kids have greater incidental knowledge and greater vocabularies than the public-school seventh and eighth graders.

Palo Alto superintendent: Achievement gap can't be eliminated

&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to closing the achievement gap, Palo Alto schools Superintendent Kevin Skelly says educators are deluding themselves. And he dares to say what's become almost unspeakable publicly:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"It's just not possible for the average kid who comes to this country in seventh or eighth grade, or even third grade, without a word of English and parents with little formal education, to match the achievement levels of kids whose mom has a Ph.D. in English from Stanford and can afford to stay home and spend time supplementing the education of her kids."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Closing the gap that is separating higher-scoring white and Asian students on one hand and lower-scoring black and Latinos on the other has become a key mission of California educators. Today, state schools Superintendent Jack O'Connell, who's made eliminating the achievement gap the centerpiece of his administration, is expected to pledge to continue those efforts, even as school budgets are axed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"We know all students can learn to a high level," said O'Connell, who hasn't wavered in his mission. "We have a moral, social and economic imperative."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yet totally eliminating the gap would be "the triumph of hope over experience," said Skelly, who came from San Diego 19 months ago to take the helm of Palo Alto's 17 schools. When educators set that lofty goal, "we're not being honest, and it's to our detriment," he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here in the shadow of Stanford University, those socioeconomic and educational differences are arguably magnified. While many professors, high-tech workers and other professionals have paid a premium to live in the city to send their children to highly regarded schools, other parents come from working-class backgrounds, some busing their children from East Palo Alto and eastern Menlo Park.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Make no mistake, Skelly said, his schools should — and do — try to bring up the achievement of Latino and African-American students. But idealistic rhetoric creates high public expectations for schools, while letting families, politicians and society in general off the hook, Skelly believes. By themselves, schools can't overcome the influence of parents, friends and communities, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He believes preschool deserves more funding to better prepare more students to learn, and schools should ensure all students are prepared for college — so they don't end up taking remedial classes at community colleges.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In California, white students outscore blacks by 157 points and Latinos by 133 points on the state's academic achievement index. It's a gap that yawns in both math and language and at all grade levels, across income levels and school districts. And studies have shown a strong
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Palo Alto, where students as a whole outscore the state by a considerable margin, the gap is even wider: On the state's academic performance index for 2008, the district's Asians scored 972, whites scored 934, Latinos 746 and African-Americans 700. That's a 234-point gap between white and black students, up one-third from 2003 and nearly 50 percent higher than statewide figures.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The white-Latino gap also is greater in Palo Alto — 188 points — than it is statewide. But the school district has narrowed that gap by 7 percent over five years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Skelly said he doesn't know why African-American achievement has fallen in the district. But he insists that schools are educating kids better than they did before. Bill Garrison, the district's testing guru, notes that a higher proportion of blacks and Latinos in Palo Alto suffer from poverty, learning disabilities and English deficiencies, all factors that pull down scores, than do whites and Asians.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Members of Palo Alto's Parent Network for Students of Color say even children who excel in elementary school falter so badly in middle and high school that many barely graduate. "There's a huge problem here," said Melissa Kirven-Brooks, mother of a senior and twin freshmen in the district and a member of the group.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Kirven-Brooks wants Palo Alto to emulate successful staff training and parental involvement programs that have helped narrow the achievement gap elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Skelly said the district is working hard on several fronts to bring up lagging students. At Barron Park Elementary School, some fifth-graders have longer school days three days a week and start school two weeks early in the summer. Districtwide, struggling students attend an academic summer school.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While Skelly's colleagues may agree with his realpolitik talk that California must give schools the means to educate the immigrant and poor students, they take issue with his words. "Teaching is more powerful than what kids bring to school with them as background," said Charles Weis, superintendent of Santa Clara County schools. "We can close the achievement gap; we just need to create the environment where it can happen."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Don Iglesias, superintendent of the San Jose Unified School District, is unequivocal: "I absolutely do believe that it is possible for kids from poverty and with high mobility to succeed."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Skelly doesn't disagree with any of that, and he believes that his staff every day works to educate all kids: "If you stop believing you can make a difference in a kid's life, you ought to get out of education," he said. He just has an issue with setting unrealistic goals — similar to the state board of education mandating that all eighth-graders, regardless of readiness, take algebra. He calls that "a nutty idea."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Schools already know what does help students: longer school days, a longer school year and, especially, an excellent classroom teacher for each child.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yet those seem elusive this year, with massive budget cuts on the horizon. Even in that dark cloud, Skelly finds a possible silver lining. In a bad economy, he believes, "People will take education more seriously."
&lt;/p&gt;

Reduce Calories.</title><published>2009-02-26T21:43:08Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T21:43:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=485" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a scientific skeptic I am careful to emphasize that my current position on any scientific question is tentatively based on available evidence. If new data comes in that warrants a change in my position, I will happily change it. Not only is this position scientific, it has the advantage of not tying you to a position that might be wrong. I try to become as emotionally dispassionate about specific conclusions as possible - it is only the validity of the process that I value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I admit I cannot help but feel a sense of satisfaction when new data supports a position I have taken on a controversial topic (a guilty pleasure, I suppose).  In this case &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/9/859"&gt;a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; comparing various weight loss diets supports my contention that weight loss is all about calories in vs calories out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a tremendous amount of popular marketing of diets claiming that the proportion of macronutrients - fats, protein, and carbohydrates - is important to weight loss and other health factors. For example, Atkins has made low-carb diets extremely popular. The problem has always been that the scientific data simply did not support any such claims. This did not stop the press from declaring that “Atkins is vindicated” every time a small and worthless pilot study came out showing possible short term advantage but no long term advantage, and overall very small differences in various diets. The weight of the evidence supported the conclusion that weight loss is achieved by burning more calories than are consumed, regardless of the source of those calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this new study summarize prior research thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small samples, underrepresentation of men, limited generalizability, a lack of blinded ascertainment of the outcome, a lack of data on adherence to assigned diets, and a large loss to follow-up limit the interpretation of many weight-loss trials. The novelty of the diet, media attention, and the enthusiasm of the researchers could affect the adherence of participants to any type of diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread of plausibility that many miracle diet advocates cling to is that their diets reduced hunger so that you could more easily curb calorie intake. This is certainly plausible, but again the problem was simply that the data did not show a big effect. I was willing to accept that maybe there was a short term effect from very low carb diets, but no study showed a persistent advantage beyond 6 months. In most of these studies at the end of a year everyone was in a similar place, with a small amount of weight loss and any differences between diets gone or diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly what was needed to resolve any lingering controversy was a large study with a long follow up. That is what this current study does. Here are the methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets; the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65%; 20, 25, and 55%; 40, 15, and 45%; and 40, 25, and 35%. The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health. The participants were offered group and individual instructional sessions for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in two-by-two factorial comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two year follow up is significant and long enough that any short term effects (on the order of months) should be worked out the data by then. After all, what people want and what is important for health is sustained long term weight control.  The results are easy to summarize - no difference in any of the groups. Low fat vs high fat, low carbs vs high carbs, low protein vs high protein - no difference. Weight loss correlated only with compliance with the diet and calorie restriction. The authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that calorie restriction and weight loss correlated with an improved lipid profile.  This is not surprising and is consistent with prior studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those issues, however, where I have encountered surprising emotionality. It is amazing how ideological people can become when it comes to food and weight. Especially if someone has tried a diet and they believe it worked for them - they become hardened true believers and passionately spread the word about their amazing discovery. They may quietly forget their fervor when the weight returns, however (which is does in the vast majority of cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the wishy-washy nature of prior evidence, this large and long follow-up study should put to rest the hype over macronutrient-based diets. I know it won’t, but it should. No one wants to hear the truth we all know in our hearts - if you want to lose weight you have to eat less and move more. The macronutrient claims are largely a distraction and public health would best be served (but not the self-help book industry) if we move past them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study does not address what should now be the real focus - how to maintain a permanent change in habits to effect a more healthy or appealing weight? Only about 5% of the population can seem to do this. Will power alone (the preferred method by default) is notoriously ineffective.  Some basic principles have been established - long term weight control correlates with sustainable changes in habits (not short-term diets) and correlates strongly with exercise. Common sense dictates others - healthy habits are more likely to be sustainable if they are easy and appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no magic solution.  I do think that fad diets are an unfortunate distraction for many people. Hopefully this study will help reduce the distraction. Unfortunately, such appealing distractions are very profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I was made aware (by my better half) of the existence of &lt;a href="http://www.google.org/flutrends/"&gt;Google Flu Trends&lt;/a&gt;.

Working nights my schedule is a tad goofy, but I wake up today to see this guy describing the changes in the new budget:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/upload/2009/02/orszag2.jpg" width="500" alt="orszag2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
This is Peter Orszag the new director of the Office of Management and Budget.  He is a nerd and I instantly like him.  I was not surprised to find &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/11/25/peter-orszag-says-goodbye/"&gt;he used to be a blogger&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was especially refreshing because for too long our government has been run by this guy:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/upload/2009/02/ogre.jpg" width="470" height="230" alt="ogre.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular I agree with &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/26/budget/index.html"&gt;their emphasis on health care&lt;/a&gt; as a necessary element for creating a viable modern economy.  America has to compete with other countries that provide this for their workers, and we have a system that regularly ruins the finances of our citizens.  I also agree with it as a moral necessity.  Within the last week I've admitted several people for whom a hospitalization would result in significant financial stress.  I talk about it with them, and they're terrified.  On the one hand, they &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; help.  Sometimes their life depends on it.  On the other hand, if they lack insurance a hospitalization can bankrupt them, and they'll honestly admit, they avoided doing anything about their problems until they become life-threateningly severe because they are they can't afford the help.  This isn't just stupid system, but immoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally the need for reform of redundancy and costs in medicine would be a welcome reform.  While the privacy issues with the electronic medical record are significant (I'd love if Chris would comment on this), the obvious need for it is undeniable.  I can't tell you how many times tests, expensive tests, are repeated because of incompatible records systems, delays in record transfer, and, frankly, the fact it's sometimes just easier to duplicate the test than do the scut to find the answer.  The emphasis on evidence based medicine, an attack on redundancy, and improvements in coverage will go a long way towards decreasing the terrible costs to insurers and the government, and terrible financial harm medical care can do to our countrymen.  I am excited about seeing how this will be implemented, and relieved that once again we have people in charge who use words like "data" and "evidence" and seem that if there are problems generated by these reforms, they will be receptive to criticism.&lt;br&gt;

On March 8th, I'll go to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecafes.org/event_pages/Boston1.html" title=""&gt;Science Cafe&lt;/a&gt; - the website is not updated yet so I don't know what the topic is yet, but it's going to be fun for sure: science+pizza+beer, who can ask for more? So, if you come to that, try to spot me in the crowd and say Hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, on Monday, March 9, 2009 at 6:00pm, we'll meet at &lt;a href="http://www.casablanca-restaurant.com/" title=""&gt;Casablanca Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; which is at 40 Brattle Street, Cambridge, MA. If you are a scientist, blogger, reader, come and let's eat and drink together. If you are on Facebook, I have made an &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/event.php?eid=130551320122" title=""&gt;Event page&lt;/a&gt; so you can get all the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and why am I in Boston in the first place?  Good question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio program &lt;a href="http://www.theworld.org/" title=""&gt;The World&lt;/a&gt;, which has been going on for many years (but was only picked up by my local NPR station WUNC a few weeks ago, since when I have been dutifully listening and I have to say it's good), is broadcast from &lt;a href="http://www.wgbh.org/" title=""&gt;WGBH&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, and is a coproduction of &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/" title=""&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pri.org/" title=""&gt;Public Radio International&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, they got an NSF grant, together with &lt;a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/" title=""&gt;Sigma Xi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/" title=""&gt;NOVA&lt;/a&gt; to build an online companion to their radio show, specifically for their science coverage, something like an online Science Cafe of sorts with listener/reader participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they invited me and a number of others to be their Web/science advisors and to meet at the station's headquarters for a day of planning: how to build and design the site, what to put there, how to connect it well with the radio program, how to run it, how to promote it and build a community of regular participants and commenters on their site, etc. This is bound to be an exciting and fun day of work!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/in_boston_are_you.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ZYVBKRCayLw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235679645542"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/spec_ed_aide_accused_of_assaulting_student">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05775db1fe1c944d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Spec Ed Aide Accused of Assaulting Student</title><published>2009-02-26T20:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T20:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/spec_ed_aide_accused_of_assaulting_student" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://salestores.com/stores/images/images_747/M470.jpg" height="150" alt="Voice Activated Recorder" style="float:right" width="70"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The county-appointed special education aide of an 8-year-old on the autism spectrum, Noah Mullin, has not only been found to have allegedly abused the child: When Noah's parents investigated the record of the aide, Elise Dansby, they found that she had pleaded no contest to assaulting an autistic student in Dickson County (Tennessee) five years ago. Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29396422/"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; reported that, after growing concerned about his son, Charles Mullin put a voice-activated recorder in his son's sweatshirt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found out was shocking," said Jody Mullins. "I cried all weekend after I heard it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Mullins got was an 8-hour audio snapshot of Elise Dansby. There was one moment during snack time when Noah was counting his money, and Dansby yelled at him, "Put the money up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You can hear him say, 'That's too loud,'" said Jody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, she takes the money away. Noah tries to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That sounded like she was about to hit him, to be honest," said Charles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's even harder to fathom in this case is that Dansby assaulted the other student, Kelsey Mayberry, &lt;em&gt;in front of her mother&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe the hardest thing of all to fathom is, how could the school district have hired Dansby?&lt;/p&gt;

I answered with a stock reply I had handy, which was: I have no affiliation with any established religion and I don’t believe in any deities, so no. I am not religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman in the group then asked me: “How smart are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really know how that followed from the original question, or from my response, but as I said, I was barely paying attention, so it might have been the perfect time to ask that particular follow-up question. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a stock reply for that one. So I hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, what does one say to ‘How smart are you’? Smarter than the average bear? So smart that I have a college degree? I can solve the TV Guide crossword almost every time? Smart enough not to stick my face in a fire? I know what a Dirty Sanchez and a Rusty Trombone are? I’m a 5.352012 on the International Intelligence Scale? I’m able to dress myself with few glaring errors? I know what love is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, really, what can you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for today’s Inquisition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media is getting another science story wrong. I keep seeing this discovery of an array of fossil placoderms as &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7909984.stm"&gt;revealing the origins of &lt;i&gt;sex&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that's not right. Sex is much, much older, and arose in single-celled organisms. Come on, plants reproduce sexually. A fish is so far removed from the time of origin of sexual reproduction that it can't tell us much about its origins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get it right. These fossils tells us about the origin of fu…uh, errm, &lt;b&gt;mating&lt;/b&gt; in vertebrates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have are a set of placoderm fossils from the Devonian (380 million years ago) of Western Australia (The Aussies are going to be insufferable, now that they can claim to be living in the birthplace of shagging) that show two interesting features: some contain small bits of placoderm armor that show no signs of digestion, and so are not likely to be relics of ancient cannibal feasts, but are the remains of viviparous broods — they were preggers. The other suggestive observation is that the pelvic girdle has structures resembling the claspers of modern sharks, an intromittent organ or penis used for internal fertilization. &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/exposing_the_intimate_details.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/exposing_the_intimate_details.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5Se9i-MolAU" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235677071630"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/26/track-satellite-debris-with-google/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be53673b952ca8c1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Track satellite debris with Google</title><published>2009-02-26T19:17:11Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T19:17:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/26/track-satellite-debris-with-google/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rob at Orbiting Frog is too cool: &lt;a href="http://orbitingfrog.com/blog/2009/02/19/tracking-the-remains-of-iridium-33-and-cosmos-2251/"&gt;he has software that allows you to track the debris from the recent satellite collision using Google Earth&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder why the guys at NORAD and other trackers didn’t know this collision was going to happen before it occurred. There are a lot of satellites, and the orbits change, but it seems simple enough to write code that allow you to see if any two satellites come within, say, a kilometer of each other at any given time. You could run that every time you update the orbital parameters of the satellites. So I’m scratching my head about that. Anyone out there in BABlogland have any inside knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235676885807"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirby_and_autism_speaks_sittin_in.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c63aabbfe1dd3156</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">David Kirby and Autism Speaks, sittin' in a tree...</title><published>2009-02-26T19:02:44Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T19:02:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/5SLpsb0V_Mw/david_kirby_and_autism_speaks_sittin_in.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirby_and_autism_speaks_sittin_in.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Busted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I give up. Since I've been sucked into the whole vaccine thing again after only one day away, I might as well highlight this simultaneously amusing and depressing tidbit. Earlier today, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;wrote about a coordinated attack&lt;/a&gt; by the antivaccine movement on the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;Autism Omnibus decision&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago. Given that it involved Generation Rescue, Jim Carrey, Jenny McCarthy, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Deirdre Imus and her eirdre Imus Environmental Center for Pediatric Oncology, the Huffington Post, Age of Autism, and various other antivaccine activists, I thought it pretty obvious that there was a lot of planning and coordination of effort. However, I never expected to find the sort of planning and coordination of effort discovered by Kevin Leitch. It turns out that David Kirby and Peter Bell of &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1921"&gt;coordinating their efforts&lt;/a&gt; to drum up "respectability" to the idea that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin discovered this when David Kirby posted an e-mail to his &lt;a href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evidence of Harm&lt;/a&gt; Yahoo! group. This e-mail happened to include an exchange between him and Peter Bell that led to Kirby writing his &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/nih-agency-head-vaccine-a_b_170034.html"&gt;latest HuffPo spinfest&lt;/a&gt; based on an &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science_news/nichd_alexander_interview.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Autism Speaks interview&lt;/a&gt; with Duane Alexander, M.D., Director of the NICHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most telling is this exchange, after Bell had forwarded this interview to Kirby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell:&lt;/strong&gt; You just happened to find this on our website, right? J

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby:&lt;/strong&gt; I go there often, yes! The piece will be up in minutes NICE JOB!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that Peter Bell isn't just anyone at Autism Speaks. He is an &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/leadership.php#peter"&gt;executive vice president there&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Peter Bell is executive vice president for programs and services at Autism Speaks. He oversees the foundation's government relations and family services activities and also serves as an advisor to the science division. In addition, on an interim basis, he is overseeing the organization?s communications and awareness efforts. Prior to his role at Autism Speaks, Bell was president and CEO of Cure Autism Now, which merged with Autism Speaks in February 2007.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; is down with the antivaccine movement for which David Kirby is chief propagandist and is feeding him information and leads on the down low. As &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1921"&gt;Kev wonders&lt;/a&gt;, why keep it secret anymore? After all, if &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;--excuse me, "Jenny McCarthy's" autism charity--is now a seemingly "respectable" autism charity in spite of its rabid antivaccination viewpoint, Autism Speaks, with its kinder, gentler antivaccine stance should be able to follow suit, shouldn't it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/david_kirby_and_autism_speaks_sittin_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/5SLpsb0V_Mw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235674242290"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33112888.post-4214531799778206847">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ad0f474418a53e8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Tedious excuses and housekeeping</title><published>2009-02-26T16:19:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T16:19:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/2009/02/tedious-excuses-and-housekeeping.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.skeptobot.com/" type="html">&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Firstly, sorry for the lack of posts. Without going into it, lets just say family matters took precedence. That and science and medicine and the people who devote themselves to those pursuits are all wonderful. But enough of that, I've used the time away to make a few changes. So many in fact that I'm going to use bullet points to try and make it more impressive than it really is...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;ul style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've a &lt;strong&gt;Twitter Feed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/skeptobot" title="Skeptobot&amp;#39;s Twitter!"&gt;located here&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, yeah, I know, but still, why not? With varying levels of success it currently; re-tweets &lt;a href="http://www.delicious.com/skeptobot" title="You&amp;#39;ll get tool tips all the time now I&amp;#39;ve found a quick way to do them."&gt;The News Fart&lt;/a&gt; (aka Del.ici.ous - which is better and older than twitter), advertises new posts on Skeptobot (a horrible twitter sin) and features random musing and cries for help from yours truly. Why not follow it? Huh? The last inane post will be in the side bar to act like a temptress or to ward you off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've changed the site's &lt;strong&gt;layout&lt;/strong&gt;. It's now pushing the wonderful Gill Sans font, which is like Helvetica, but less snobbish and hasn't had a documentary made about it. You might not have Gill Sans installed (it's only present by default on OS X) so in that case you'll have to make do with Helvetica, or even Verdana. Sorry but you've only yourself to blame. Also I don't have a Windows machine so if there are any problems of XP/Vista do let me know. Though I've already had some feedback so I think it should be fine.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against my better judgement and whilst feeling very dirty, I've put a PayPal tip jar on the site because a very kind person asked if they could buy me a pint over the internet. I honestly expect this never to be used so please don't feel obliged. Especially when much more &lt;a href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/"&gt;deserving sites&lt;/a&gt; exist (as the side bar attests). That said, It would guilt me into posting more. Also if anyone wants to buy me a pint at the &lt;strong&gt;Skeptic in the Pub&lt;/strong&gt; meets (Roger!) then go right ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remember that &lt;strong&gt;great post&lt;/strong&gt; I was talking about? It's going on hold for a while. The pressure of it (especially at the moment) put me off posting &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; - so I'll just wait for it to fall naturally once things have calmed down.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally my vanity has lead me to throw away my secret identity. The site is no longer anonymous. Stalkers can work out who I am quite easily now despite choosing the most obfuscating &lt;strong&gt;mugshot&lt;/strong&gt; I possible could. I feel it will make me choose my words more carefully and hopefully improve this place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33112888-4214531799778206847?l=www.skeptobot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Bill)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.skeptobot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.skeptobot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Skeptobot</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skeptobot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235673509852"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4091">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68b79f8aa35c5966</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Barack Obama"/><category term="language"/><title type="html">The Empiricist-in-Chief</title><published>2009-02-26T18:25:26Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T18:25:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/VQ_tZOGyXg4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/the-empiricist-in-chief/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Following up on yesterday's post about quantifying political speech, Dartmouth's Michael Herron - who is a first-rate political scientist and data hound - points out that Obama was the first president to speak about "data" in his inaugural address, and only the second to mention "statistics."

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Gehrels, gamma-ray astronomer and Principle Investigator on the Swift GRB mission, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/three_honors.html"&gt;just received the 2009 SPIE George W. Goddard award&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SPIE &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; that he got it &amp;quot;…in recognition of Neil’s pioneering contributions in opening the gamma-ray spectral window as its own astronomical discipline through his leadership of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and &lt;a href="http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html"&gt;the Swift Mission&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; But I know the real reason: he edited two chapters in my book, &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; (the supernova and gamma-ray burst ones, natch), and they couldn’t give the award to me because I’d just throw it on my pile of statuettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So congrats to my friend Neil, who really &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have an ever-growing pile of awards. Swift is a remarkable mission, still going strong, and still doing great science.

In some ways, it's a
rehash of the "Nullity" nonsense from a couple of years ago, but with a new spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't remember &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/12/nullity_the_nonsense_number_1.php"&gt;nullity&lt;/a&gt;, it was the attempt of one idiot to define division by zero.
He claimed to have "solved" the great problem of dividing by zero, and by doing so, to be able
to do all manner of amazing things, such as to build better computers that would be less prone
to bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.singularics.com/products/encryption/"&gt;Today's garbage&lt;/a&gt; is in the
same vein: another guy, this one named Jeff Cook, who claims to have "solved" the problem of
division by zero. But this one claims that this gives him a way to prove the Reimann
hypothesis, to rapidly crack RSA public key encryption, and to devise a new "theoretically
unbreakable" encryption algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The grandiosity of this Mr. Cook is astonishing. He's started a company (which is looking
for investors!); here's a quote from his company's homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Great scientific discoveries&lt;/b&gt; mark the milestones of human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such are the accomplishments achieved by the men and women of Singularics. Standing on the
shoulders of giants such as Albert Einstein and Bernhard Riemann, we have reached up through
nature's veil and seen what lies hidden there more clearly than anyone else before us. Our
discoveries have yielded a new mathematical framework, one that provides a profound
understanding of nature's basic mechanics. We have discovered &lt;b&gt;The Science of
Singularics™&lt;/b&gt;, the study of the singularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already found a variety of important applications of &lt;b&gt;Singularic Technology™&lt;/b&gt;,
but perhaps the most immediately useful are &lt;b&gt;Neutronic Encryption™&lt;/b&gt;, a new theoretically
unbreakable public key encryption algorithm and &lt;b&gt;Singularic Power™&lt;/b&gt;, a new form of clean
power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutronic Encryption, our next generation public key encryption algorithm, will play a
vital role in the digital age by ensuring that the electronic information of governments,
industry and individuals is kept secure and private in a world where cyber-terrorism is on the
rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We have also developed a new primary power generation system capable of delivering
abundant, clean and inexpensive energy that can satisfy power requirements on any scale.
Singularic Power production technology generates zero pollution and can therefore play an
instrumental role in promoting a harmonious coexistence between human civilization and the
Earth's fragile ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; To date, our analysis of the mathematics and physics at the singularity has lead us to
eight important new inventions, most notably in the fields of information security and clean
energy. All eight inventions (patents pending), have significant and immediate application in
the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It is our vision to use these advances to bring about great improvements for everyone
through new technology, intelligently applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mr. Cook doesn't have too high an opinion of himself, does he?&lt;/p&gt;

The article says, "While there's services for young kids, adults with autism have few options.  But at Devereux, CAAPP picks up where some alternative schools leave off." (video included with the CAAPP article)  A much more mature program, Willobrook in New Haven, Connecticut, &lt;a href="http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2009/02/15/news/a1vista.txt"&gt;teaches vocational, life, social, and self-advocacy skills&lt;/a&gt;. Willowbrook's executive director describes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When students come here, they had no voice, they had no ability to advocate for themselves, say what they needed, felt they had no right to choose ... now that individual is not only living in their own apartment, but they're choosing their own paint colors for the walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know anything personally about CAAPP or Willowbrook and am not explicitly endorsing them (if anyone here knows anything specific about the programs feel free to comment).  But the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of such programs is highly appealing to me.  Perhaps because I'd have less angst in my life right now if somehow I had picked up a few useful life skills in the past thirty-mumble years like, er, how to prepare a meal...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are things I wonder about when I read about these sorts of programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Are the programs really as good and useful as they sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If so, can we have more such programs, please?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. How many of these programs are accessible and open to older people who are long past "transition age" from high school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching young adults how to manage life and advocate for their needs with their unique set of abilities and disabilities after public school is a gap in services to be bridged.  But that gap may be even wider for older adults who are not being "transitioned" from one special program to another.  For those of us who entered the system late, particularly those of us without a parent to lend "credibility" to our legitimate needs, access to services may be currently unbridgeable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source

&lt;blockquote&gt;Is blogging a part of science, journalism or public discourse? In fact it may be all of these -- an ambiguity that can sometimes leave scientists feeling uncertain about the rules of the game.

&lt;p&gt;----------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blogosphere differs from mass media and specialized media in many respects, but the same considerations apply in disseminating new scientific results there. Authors of papers in press have the right to correct misrepresentations and to point to results that will appear in a paper. But a full discussion should await the paper's publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, researchers would do well to blog more than they do. The experience of journals such as Cell and PLoS ONE, which allow people to comment on papers online, suggests that researchers are very reluctant to engage in such forums. But the blogosphere tends to be less inhibited, and technical discussions there seem likely to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are societal debates that have much to gain from the uncensored voices of researchers. A good blogging website consumes much of the spare time of the one or several fully committed scientists that write and moderate it. But it can make a difference to the quality and integrity of public discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the whole thing, then go over to the &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/groups/naturenewsandopinion/forum/topics/4044" title=""&gt;Nature Opinion forum&lt;/a&gt; to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most preposterous stuff, of course, comes from Claire Bolderson, the BBC interviewer; but the responsible scientist, Mark Pagel, doesn't come off very well in this exchange either, in my opinion. (Though I recognize that such interviews are highly edited, and may seriously misrepresent the way that the interviewee would prefer to express the ideas involved.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the scientific background is Mark Pagel, Quentin D. Atkinson, and Andrew Meade, "&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7163/abs/nature06176.html"&gt;Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history&lt;/a&gt;", Nature 2007, which was a sensible-enough paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a new research report behind the recent blizzard of related stories, but none of those that I've seen so far tells us where to find it. I think that I can guess what Pagel et al. probably did, and how it relates to what's being said about it in the mass media, but I'll reserve further comment on the scientific background until I've had a chance to read the research in a form unfiltered by journalism. [Update 2/27/2009: actually, I'm now leaning to the conclusion that the 2007 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper is all that there is behind this. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The print version at BBC News is here: "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7911645.stm"&gt;Oldest English words' identified&lt;/a&gt;", 2/28/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Henderson, "&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5805522.ece"&gt;A handy little guide to small talk in the Stone Age&lt;/a&gt;", The Times, leads with the value to cross-era communication:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A “time traveller’s phrasebook” that could allow basic communication between modern English speakers and Stone Age cavemen is being compiled by scientists studying the evolution of language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Sample at The Guardian ("&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/26/language-evolution-words-extinction-dirty"&gt;Word facing extinction: 'Dirty' will be scrubbed from the English dictionary&lt;/a&gt;") is worried about &lt;em&gt;dirty&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The unrelenting force of evolution is about to take an unexpected toll on the English language by forcing some of our favourite words into extinction. The word "dirty" is most in danger of going the way of the dodo, and could vanish from use completely within 750 years, researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Roy Britt at LiveScience ("&lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/history/090226-first-words.html"&gt;Oldest English Words Revealed?&lt;/a&gt;") features the impact on Scrabble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A game of Scrabble might not have been all that different in Stone Age times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Using a computer simulation, a British researcher says he's examined the rate of change of words in languages to reveal the oldest English-sounding words, which would have been used by Stone Age humans 20,000 years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niall Firth in the Daily Mail explains it all as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Some of the oldest words in the English language date back more than 20,000 years, it has been revealed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Words like 'I', 'we', 'two', 'three' and 'five' were probably used by our ancestors in the Stone Age - and have changed very little since then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these cute conceits, not to say idiocies, were prominent in the brief News Hour piece, which thus managed an extraordinary compression of nonsense. I wouldn&amp;#39;t object if ideas like small-talk with cavemen and stone-age scrabble words were presented as little jokes, in the context of an explanation of why (for example) the effects of sound change mean that conserved cognates — like &lt;a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/words/370/penkwe-.pdf"&gt;the various IE versions of &lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are unlikely to be much more helpful to communication than unrelated words are, over a span of even a few thousand years, much less ten thousand or twenty thousand or (lord help us) forty thousand. But that's not what we have here, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: As several commenters have observed, the source of the flurry in the news media was a University of Reading press release, "&lt;a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/about/newsandevents/releases/PR19825.asp"&gt;Scientists discover oldest words in the English language and predict which ones are likely to disappear in the future&lt;/a&gt;", 2/26/2009. There is apparently no associated research publication, at least so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release is rather misleading in several ways, most strikingly by talking about retention of cognates over time without mentioning the sound changes that may make them unrecognizable to ordinary speakers after a few hundred years, and will almost certainly do so after a few thousand years, much less 10,000 or 30,000 years. And the press release also makes it seem as if the scientists have &amp;quot;been able to go back almost 30,000 years&amp;quot; in reconstructing Indo-European, which is almost certainly not what they are claiming. In the absence of a coherent explanation it&amp;#39;s hard to tell what they did do — but my current hypothesis is that they used the method documented &lt;a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/363/1512/3955.full"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to estimate rates of replacement for various words in something like the Swadesh list for Indo-European languages, and then applied standard methods to those estimates in order to calculate how probable it is that each word might survive (in however mutated a cognate form) for N years. &lt;em&gt;[On further reflection, I think that this is probably just a re-presentation of the work in the 2007 Nature paper, which uses Swadesh-list-type data to estimate the half-life of various words, allowing guesses about how likely it is that a particular word might have been retained — in the sense of having a modern cognate — from time depths many millennia before there is any documentation or even any reconstruction.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's nothing in the press release, as misleading as it may be, about playing scrabble with cavemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of making fun of the sillier journalistic excesses, and Mark Pagel's apparent lack of prudence or even collusion in encouraging them, I'd like to underline the fact that the methods (of computational phylogeny in general, and Bayesian approaches in particular) are worthwhile and interesting, and have in other cases (e.g. &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1050"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) been applied in a responsible way to advance our understanding of linguistic history. ]&lt;/p&gt;

This is what the Christian needs when it comes to the other religions he rejects: good evidence along with good arguments. If a Muslim argues that the Christian simply refuses to believe in Allah because of a hardened heart, the Christian will scoff at the suggestion just as I do when a Christian says I refuse to believe in Jesus because of a hardened heart, so let’s just dismiss this as any kind of explanation for why I don’t believe, okay? We all need good evidence along with good arguments to believe, and all of us claim this to be the case. But we also must admit some people are brainwashed into believing. The best and only antidote to delusional beliefs is good evidence along with good arguments.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve already articulated some of the kinds of evidence I need to believe: &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-would-convince-me-christianity-is.html"&gt;just click here&lt;/a&gt;. But this evidence does not exist. What good evidence is there to believe Christianity, the particular local one you believe in, Christian? There is no external evidence that shows any miracle occurred. There is no archaeological evidence for the Exodus or the Canaanite conquest. There is no external evidence for Noah’s flood. There is no external evidence that Daniel was saved from the lion’s den. There is no external evidence that Jesus was born of a virgin in Bethlehem. There is no external evidence that Jesus was transfigured before the eyes of his disciples. There is no external evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, either, nor can such evidence be found in the Turin Shroud. There is none as in N-O-N-E!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian claims that evidence of the universe’s complexity points to a designer. But even if so, and there are good reasons to doubt this, what reason can be found for not thinking this universe is the result of the last act of some god as he was dying in which he merely started the quantum fluctuation that produced this universe? And even if this universe was designed by this god, or some other god like Allah, why is there so much &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unintelligent-Design-Mark-Perakh/dp/1591020840/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1235651276&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;unintelligent design&lt;/a&gt; found in it, including so many natural disasters? The supposed fall of Adam and Eve in the garden is pure myth, but even if true, it does not account for what we see in this so-called designed universe for so many reasons I don’t know where to start, except to say that the designer must be blamed for not providing them the needed evidence to believe him, otherwise they would never had sinned in the first place! And it is sheer barbarism to punish all of the children who suffer in this world for the sin of Adam and Eve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian claims he has the evidence of morals that point to a moral lawgiver. But again, if there is a moral lawgiver, then this does not show us that Yahweh exists over Allah or some other god. And there are good reasons to doubt this anyway, given the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/01/christian-illusion-of-moral.html"&gt;Euthyphro dilemma&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that it does absolutely no good to say there is a moral law when Christians cannot provide any agreed upon specifics about what that so-called moral law is when it comes to the myriad disputes they themselves have had over what God requires of them down through the ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian claims there is good evidence for the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. But this evidence is mainly internal to the canonized New Testament texts and gospels which were redacted from oral story-telling and various non-inspired written accounts of the life and death of Jesus. This Jesus is best thought of as merely another failed Jewish &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019512474X?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=019512474X&amp;amp;adid=1CRNBW4Y2DVEVZ43RREB&amp;amp;"&gt;apocalyptic doomsday prophet&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing more. And so upon his shocking crucifixion his disciples had &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/02/matthews-posts.html"&gt;visionary experiences of him&lt;/a&gt; and concluded just like the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerites"&gt;Millerites&lt;/a&gt;, the Jehovah’s witnesses, and other similar religious groups that their God was providing a new direction for their cult. In the case of the early disciples they concluded from these visions that Jesus was still alive and that the end of the world (the &lt;em&gt;eschaton&lt;/em&gt;) would come very soon in their lifetime. Besides, historical evidence is &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/02/lessings-ugly-broad-ditch.html"&gt;very poor evidence&lt;/a&gt; to believe in extraordinary claims like Christians must believe in anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lastly, but probably not exhaustively, Christians will claim they have a religious experience which counts as good evidence for what they believe, like an inner witness of the Holy Spirit. This is so bogus of an argument it’s hard to even start. Every religious believer of almost every particular religious faith will claim they too have had veridical religious experiences to support what they believe, so religious experiences are entirely untrustworthy to decide which religious truth claims are the correct ones. I’ve already provided a way to test these experiences &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/01/testing-religious-experience-by.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, and I critiqued William Lane Craig’s defense of the inner witness of the Holy Spirit in several places, the links of which can be &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/william-lane-craig-is-epistemological_15.html"&gt;found in this last post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from the design argument mentioned above, what about the other arguments for the existence of the Christian God? Suffice it to say that at best, if they all work, they only conclude that a deist god exists, and that kind of God is so far removed from the triune God believed by Christians in the Bible that it’s like trying to fly a plane to the moon…it cannot be done. But in fact none of these arguments can give any good reason for why the Christian God does not have the same problems with regard to how he himself exists as a fully formed 3 in 1 eternal being who has never learned anything new because he supposedly knows all things, and so forth. Where did he come from? It is a nonanswer to merely parrot back to me that "he always has existed." That's a mere language game I don't buy into. Explain it. If you can't do this then the simpler brute fact excludes such a complex being by virtue of Ockham's razor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian, since you and I believe there are many people in the world today who are deluded by their religious beliefs, including brainwashed people in the so called “cults” that need “deprogramming," how do you know that you are not one of them having been brainwashed by the very culture you were brought up in? How do you know? &lt;strong&gt;You must consider this a possibility for it’s a fact that brainwashed people do not know they have been brainwashed&lt;/strong&gt;. It matters not how many people believe as you do in your own culture. They may be brainwashed with you, just like you think the more than one billion Muslims have been brainwashed. You need to clearly think about these sorts of things. Read my links. Think about them. My claim is that you are brainwashed. I’m here to help you. Demand good evidence along with good reasons for why you believe, or cease believing. It’s that simple. You do it with everything else you accept. Do the same here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I honestly think that I was brainwashed by the Christian culture I was raised in. Now I demand evidence to believe along with good arguments. I adjure the Christian believer to do likewise. Do not believe upon insufficient evidence or poor arguments. Do not believe just what you were taught to believe, for again, as far as you know the people and the culture who taught you what to believe may be brainwashed as well, just like you claim this of the Muslims, the Mormons, and the Hindus who were all raised in their own particular religious cultures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;I know there are many Christians who read this Blog who refuse to get and read my book that offers a sustained critique of Christianity. It's getting some pretty &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;good reviews&lt;/a&gt;. To test whether or not you are one of the brainwashed ones you owe it to yourselves to get and read it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I tutor the SATs, including the writing section, in addition to helping students with other kinds of writing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;What am I supposed to tell my students about zombie rules? The fact is that some misguided teachers and graders may enforce them. (SAT graders not so much, though–-I think I'm close to getting a handle on what those people are looking out for.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;When I was in school I breezed happily by all this nonsense because I had smart teachers and a strong authorial voice. But not all of my students do. So what to say?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start by quoting Rob Balder's &lt;a href="http://www.partiallyclips.com/about.php"&gt;PartiallyClips&lt;/a&gt; for 2/17/2009, which celebrates all of us who, like Emily, escaped from school with our souls intact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Click on the image for a larger version)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But what's the right answer to Emily's question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own suggestion is to present this problem as a matter of "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_Design"&gt;audience design&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientific publications forbid the use of first-person pronouns. Thus the Acoustical Society of America &lt;a href="http://asa.aip.org/honolulu/honolulu.html#34"&gt;explicitly intructs&lt;/a&gt; those submitting papers that they should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Use passives instead of pronouns "I" and "we," e.g., "It was noted" instead of "We noted."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously not a claim about the English language, or even an entirely general fact about scientific writing, where you can often find sentences like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;To get further insights in the molecular mechanisms, we reduced endogenous TERT levels by shRNA and measured mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, the prohibition of first-person pronouns is an idiosyncratic quirk of certain organizations, who have elevated into a "rule" the tendency of scientific and technical writing to be objective, detached and impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could argue about whether this tendency is a Good Thing (because objectivity should be valued in scientific discourse) or a Bad Thing (because it encourages people to hide their motivations and their doubts). And  if we agree that impersonal prose should be our goal, we could argue about whether elimating first-person pronouns in favor of passive-voice clauses is a good way to get there. But if we&amp;#39;re submitting something to the Acoustical Society of America, this whole discussion is beside the point — we need to play by their rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that you can teach "zombie rules" in something like this same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, you can explain what the "rule" is; you can tell the story of its history and its motivation; you can demonstrate that it's not really a fact about the English language in general, or even about formal written English as used by the best writers over the course of history; and you can tell the students where they are likely to run into people who believe in this particular myth, or at least may try to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result should be to teach the students a little something about the structure of the English language, a bit of sociolinguistics, and a little intellectual history to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zombie Rule forbidding phrase-final prepositions, lampooned &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1173"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is an especially good candidate for this treatment. Students get to learn what a relative clause is, who John Dryden, Ben Jonson, and Winston Churchill were, and perhaps, if you can invent a clean enough version of the standard joke that's still funny, what a vocative is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zombie Rule &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002224.html"&gt;forbidding initial coordinators&lt;/a&gt; is not quite as good a case, since I don't think there's a striking anecdote about how it got started. But you can tell a story about the good motivations that this "rule" perverts; you can teach a little bit of syntax; you can give examples of great writers who use sentence-initial &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;; you can find some examples where sentence-initial &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is used inappropriately, or is over-used; and all this should lead to a good discussion about the stylistic and rhetorical issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235662620869"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4089">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cd6ac1caca74d99</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="Bernie Madoff" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="fraud" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">Would a Fraud Bounty Have Exposed Madoff Years Ago?</title><published>2009-02-26T15:30:55Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T16:57:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/would-a-fraud-bounty-have-exposed-madoff-years-ago/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/would-a-fraud-bounty-have-exposed-madoff-years-ago/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/would-a-fraud-bounty-have-exposed-madoff-years-ago/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">Laura Goldman is a money manager who claims to have figured out back in the 1990's, in the space of about 45 minutes, that Bernie Madoff was a fraud.

The latest is the case of the foolish woman who kept an adult chimpanzee as a pet, and got badly mauled for her trouble. This, of course, is &lt;a href="http://www.worldviewtimes.com/article.php/articleid-4642/Brannon-Howse/Sean-McDowell"&gt;Charles Darwin's fault&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is it that we live in a culture where people think it's safe to have a chimpanzee as a pet? Where do people get the idea that we ought to take a wild animal and treat it like a human being? The chimp owner treated the animal like a son who ate at her table, slept in her house, and even drove her car.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Last week the world celebrated Darwin's 200th birthday. Universities placed tributes to Darwinism on their home page (examples include Oxford and Cambridge) and major networks such as BBC ran extensive programs devoted to Darwin's great contribution to the world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yet, ironically, this week we witness a brutal act that seems to logically follow from Darwin's ideas. You may be wondering how I can possibly link Darwin to this atrocious event. But think about it, if humans are deeply related to chimps then why not expect them to act that way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;…seems to logically follow…&amp;quot; — I don&amp;#39;t think that Mr McDowell understands that word &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot; very well. I don&amp;#39;t think Darwin ever endorsed the idea that one should keep large, powerful, temperamental animals with the strength to rip your arms off as pets; I&amp;#39;m quite confident that neither did he regard the differences between animals as trivial. I&amp;#39;m also even more closely related to Charles Manson than I am to any chimp, something with which even a brainwashed parrot for jebus like McDowell would agree, yet this imposes on me no desire or obligation to go on a psychopathic killing spree.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's funny that McDowell complains that the owner treated the chimp like a son. After all, if we obeyed the rules of his religion, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iyNZ4HeuHUwkSwEetLbbBFPZy0DQD96I6G800"&gt;this is how we should treat a son&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said a 58-year-old man stabbed his teenage son after he refused to take off his hat at church earlier in the day. The father and his 19-year-old son got into an argument on Sunday afternoon. That's when police said the father went to a car, got a knife and stabbed his son in the left buttock and fled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick, shut down the churches! Christianity leads to filial buttock mutilation!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/in_addition_to_the_holocaust_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pafXEz0-bpc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235653823300"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1184">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0a6658a505c9a2a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">The Hong Kong lectures</title><published>2009-02-26T13:06:19Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T13:06:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1184" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Allow me, if you will, to briefly pervert the general functions of Language Log to send a personal message to the Hong Kong readers of Language Log who have been asking me about my upcoming lectures in their city.  The answer is, on Monday (2 March 2009) I will be doing two engagements at different universities in the city, back to back.  From 2 to 3:30 p.m., a lecture called &amp;quot;English Grammar: The Lost Twentieth Century&amp;quot; at Hong Kong Baptist University, in room RRS905 in the Sir Run Run Shaw Building on the Ho Sin Hang Campus; and then (after a rapid transfer by limousine; I may arrive looking a bit harried) from 5 to 6:30 p.m. a lecture called &amp;quot;Language Studies: Bridging Science and Humanities&amp;quot;, in the Inaugural Series for the new Faculty of Humanities at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, in room N003.  Both, I believe, are wide open to the general public with no ticketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, to Language Log's public they are open, because I shall demand it.  Just put your gold Language Log Premier Membership card on the card reader facing downward with the embedded microchip at this end.  Or if you don't have one of those (no one does, yet; we are having trouble with our microchip supplier), then give the code word &lt;b&gt;syncategorematicity&lt;/b&gt; to the guards on the door.  Or ask for me by name and I will get you in via the stage door.  If they try to keep you out I will stamp my foot and refuse to go on.  You are Language Log readers; you are important.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't try to take in both lectures.  There is such a thing as overdoing it.  It is possible to overdose on Geoff time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also be giving a more informal and slightly more linguistics-oriented lecture called "Grammaticality, Frequency, and Evidence in Syntax" at 6:30 p.m.  on Tuesday, also at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University; but I don't know the room details, so you might have to call Cherine Yu or Jody Lee on 852 2766 5067 or 852 9080 4226 to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;At least, that's what Michael Corleone said in The Godfather, Part 3, and even though I'm not a mafia don, I can sort of relate to where he's coming from, if you know what I mean. It seems that whenever I try to get away from blogging about the nigh infinite level of stupidity and pseudoscience that emanates from the disease promotion movement (i.e., the antivaccine movement), it seems as though they somehow find a way to pull me back in. Of course, I'd rather like to think of myself as the reluctant gunslinger pulled out of retirement for one more battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either that, or certain people in the antivaccine movement twist science, logic, reason, and reality so much that they piss me off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, such a description applies to the chief &lt;em&gt;macher&lt;/em&gt; of the antivaccine movement these days, Jenny McCarthy and "her" autism organization, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, willingly given up to her Googleness by former ruler J. B. Handley. Of course, the recent&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt; twin blows&lt;/a&gt; of the revelations about hero to the antivaccine movement Andrew Wakefield's scientific fraud and the resounding repudiation of the first three test cases in the Autism Omnibus proceeding have drive the antivaccine movement a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/we_support_dr_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;bit crazy.&lt;/a&gt; Normal people, faced with such an unrelenting stream of scientific and other evidence strongly refuting their beliefs, would start to think that maybe their beliefs need readjusting. Not Generation Rescue. The reality warp field surrounding J.B. Handley, Jenny McCarthy, and their Kool Aid drinkers is too strong. Given their cultish certainty that, no matter what the science says, it absolutely, positively has to be the vaccines causing autism, they can never retreat, never surrender, and, above all, never, ever even entertain the possibility for a minute that their most fervent belief is based on on the scientific equivalent of smoke and mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I knew a counterattack had to be coming. At first, I thought that the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/keith_olbermann_played_for_a_fool.php"&gt;smearing of Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt; and rants about the "bias" and unfairness of the Special Masters were that counterattack. But I was wrong. I should have known that the antivaccine movement knew it was in trouble and would pull out all the stops to stop the bleeding after being riddled with reports calling their world view into even more doubt than usual. I should have known that the counterattack would consist of more than just the previous feeble efforts to smear Brian Deer and blame the Special Masters' rulings on a big pharma conspiracy. I should have known that GR would resort to yet another ad in &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/generation-rescue-ad-in-usa-today-court-again-concedes-vaccines-cause-autism.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene/GenRescue_ad.gif" width="350" height="676" alt="GenRescue_ad.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I should have known that they'd throw together the chief apologist for the antivaccine movement, along with its chief conspiracy-monger, namely David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., respectively.  And where, you ask, would two such luminaries of the antivaccine movement ply their fallacious arguments? Where do you think? Yes, appearing Tuesday night on that repository of antivaccine lies and pseudoscience, The Huffington Post, was this gem by those two crappy tastes that taste crappy together, David Kirby and RFK, Jr., entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html"&gt;Vaccine Court: Autism Debate Continues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If stupid were a poison, all life on earth would be dead and rotting from the emanations of the two articles contained under the above link. And if stupid really did burn, the surface of the earth would consist of nothing more than charred rock, with the oceans themselves vaporized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/v3TfL7bASeE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235653280298"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=387">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc244c39993eafc3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Public Health"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="evidence-based medicine"/><category term="Government"/><category term="Incentives"/><category term="Penalties"/><category term="Playbook"/><category term="Practice Guidelines"/><category term="Practice Patterns"/><category term="science based medicine"/><category term="Senate Finance Committee"/><category term="Senator Baucus"/><category term="UpToDate"/><title type="html">How To Get Physicians To Use The Same Science-Based Playbook</title><published>2009-02-26T13:00:20Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T13:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=387" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone agrees that we need to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to patients in the US. We’ve all heard the &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/errback.htm"&gt;frightening statistics&lt;/a&gt; from the Institute of Medicine about medical error rates - that as many as 98,000 patients die each year as a result of them - and we also know that the US spends &lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/publications/news/news-now/clinical-care-research/20071024us-europeanhealth.html"&gt;about 33%&lt;/a&gt; more than most industrialized country on healthcare, without substantial improvements in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a large number of quality improvement initiatives rely on additional rules, regulations, and penalties to inspire change (for example, decreasing Medicare payments to hospitals with higher readmission rates, and decreasing provider compensation based on &lt;a href="http://blog.getbetterhealth.com/another-example-of-good-medicine-that-does-not-follow-protocol/2009.02.24"&gt;quality indicators&lt;/a&gt;). Not only am I skeptical about this stick vs. carrot strategy, but I think it will further demoralize providers, pit key stakeholders against one another, and cause people to spend their energy figuring out how to game the system than do the right thing for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a carrot approach that could theoretically result in a $757 billion savings/year that has not been fully explored - and I suggest that we take a look at it before we “release the hounds” on hospitals and providers in an attempt to improve healthcare quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing on budget options for health care reform on February 25th. One of the potential areas of substantial cost savings identified by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is non evidence-based variations in practice patterns. In fact, at the recent Medicare Policy Summit, CBO staff identified this problem as one of the &lt;a href="http://blog.getbetterhealth.com/highlights-from-the-medicare-policy-summit-whats-on-the-mind-of-the-congressional-budget-office-cbo/2009.02.15"&gt;top three causes of rising healthcare costs&lt;/a&gt;. Just take a look at this map of &lt;a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8972/toc.htm"&gt;variations of healthcare spending&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for the local practice cultures that influence treatment choices and prices for those treatments. There seems to be no organizing principle at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Baucus (Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee) appeared genuinely distressed about this situation and was unclear about the best way to incentivize (or penalize) doctors to make their care decisions more uniformly evidence-based. In my opinion, a “top down” approach will likely be received with mistrust and disgruntlement on the part of physicians. What the Senator needs to know is that there is a bottom up approach already in place that could provide a real win-win here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 340 thousand physicians have access to a fully peer-reviewed, regularly updated decision-support tool (called “&lt;em&gt;UpToDate&lt;/em&gt;“) online and on their PDAs. This virtual treatment guide has ~3900 contributing authors and editors, and 120 million page views per year. The goal of the tool is to make specific recommendations for patient care based on the best available evidence. The content is monetized 100% through subscriptions - meaning there is no industry influence in the guidelines adopted. Science is carefully analyzed by the very top leaders in their respective fields, and care consensuses are reached - and updated as frequently as new evidence requires it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has this tool developed “cult status” among physicians - but some confess to being &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2007/07/uptodate-microsoft-of-medicine-texts.html"&gt;addicted to it&lt;/a&gt;, unwilling to practice medicine without it at their side for reference purposes. The brand is universally recognized for its quality and clinical excellence and is subscribed to by 88% of academic medical centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a&lt;a href="http://www.uptodate.com/docs/home/BonisAbstract.pdf"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Medical Informatics &lt;/em&gt;found that there was a “dose response” relationship between use of the decision support tool and quality indicators, meaning that the more pages of the database that were accessed by physicians at participating hospitals, the better the patient outcomes (lower complication rates and better safety compliance), and shorter the lengths of stay. (Caveat: Additional studies are needed to clarify whether use of &lt;em&gt;UpToDate&lt;/em&gt; is a marker for the better performance, an independent cause of it, or a synergistic part of other quality improvement characteristics at better-performing hospitals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we already have an online, evidence-based treatment support guide that many physicians know and respect. If improved quality measures are our goal, why not incentivize hospitals and providers to use &lt;em&gt;UpToDate&lt;/em&gt; more regularly? A public-private partnership like this (where the government subsidizes subscriptions for hospitals, channels &lt;a href="http://blog.getbetterhealth.com/comparative-clinical-effectiveness-research-how-will-it-impact-healthcare/2009.02.24"&gt;comparative clinical effectiveness research findings&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;UpToDate&lt;/em&gt; staff, and perhaps offers Medicare bonuses to hospitals and providers for &lt;em&gt;UpToDate&lt;/em&gt; page views) could single handedly ensure that all clinicians are operating out of the same playbook (one that was created by a team of unbiased scientists in reviewing all available research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this might be the easiest, most palatable way to target the problem of inconsistent practice styles on a national level. And as Senator Baucus has noted - the potential savings associated with having all providers on the same practice “page” is on the order of $757 billion. And that’s real money.&lt;/p&gt;

This is further reason why, when it comes to the subject of vaccines and autism, it's going to be an &lt;a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/labnotes/archive/2009/02/25/vaccines-and-autism-the-unending-story.aspx"&gt;unending story&lt;/a&gt;: That last phrase is the title of a &lt;a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/labnotes/archive/2009/02/25/vaccines-and-autism-the-unending-story.aspx"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; blog post by Sharon Begley, who wrote last week's article about how &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_vaccine-autism_scare_panic_in_the_wrong_place"&gt;childhood vaccines became villains&lt;/a&gt;. Begley cites a &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Abell.BANKS.02-0738V.pdf"&gt;case concerning vaccines and Pervasive Developmental Disorder&lt;/a&gt; that was decided in 2007 but only released now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case, the parents of Bailey Banks, now 10, argued that their son had a seizure 16 days after his first MMR, in 2000. That, they said, led to Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a rare neurological disease, which in turn led to PDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism is one type of PDD, "&lt;a href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/pdd/pdd.htm"&gt;Pervasive Developmental Disorder&lt;/a&gt;; Asperger's Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, and Rett's Syndrome are others.  Bailey's delays are connected to the MMR vaccine, but the court is careful to distinguish PDD from autism in saying that Bailey "'more likely than not suffers from PDD, and not from autism.” As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/02/dumb_and_dangerous---kennedy-k.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;PalMD&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/02/dumb_and_dangerous---kennedy-k.php?utm_source=sbhomepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_content=channellink"&gt;Science Blogs&lt;/a&gt; writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This case] examined a young patient who received an MMR vaccine, and then 16 days later suffered a seizure. He was evaluated and at least one doctor felt he had ADEM, a severe neurological disease. The best statistics estimate a rate of ADEM after measles vaccination of about 1-2 per 1 million, although the vaccine has never actually been proved to cause ADEM. The rate of ADEM associated with measles infection is about 1 in 1000, a proven causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time after his seizure, he was diagnosed as having pervasive developmental delay, a diagnosis that falls on the "autism spectrum". Because of the temporal relationship of these disorders, and because there was at least some scientific plausibility to connect the vaccine to his later neurologic illness, the court found in favor of the plaintiff. Notice, this is not a "vaccines cause autism" finding---it is a "in this particular case, a vaccine &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have caused ADEM, which &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have lead to an autism-like disorder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Kennedy, Jr., and David Kirby have presented the Banks case in the February 24th &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; as nothing less than proof that the recent &lt;a&gt;Omnibus rullings&lt;/a&gt; are irrelevant, as the "vaccine court" had already found a connection---the case of Bailey Banks---to be true. Kirby even writes that "PDD" is interchangeable with "ASD" in the language of public health"----an interesting statement from him, as PDD refers to the broader spectrum of autism diagnoses. (See &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1917"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; for more on this.) In his various writings seeking to link autism to mercury, vaccines, etc. over the years, Kirby has &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-rebranding-of-autism/"&gt;often made it clear&lt;/a&gt; that "autism" in the (supposedly "vaccine-injured") children he is representing is something different the more "high-functioning" types of autism (i.e., Asperger's Syndrome). Curious then to see Kirby referring to the autism spectrum and to the different conditions that are grouped under the umbrella of "autism spectrum disorders" and of "pervasive developmental disorders": Is he moving away from only writing about children with "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/autism-mercury-and-the-c_b_4133.html"&gt;full-blown&lt;/a&gt;" autism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it with the continued desire, certainly in Kennedy and Kirby and in many others, to find a link between autism and vaccines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One answer lies in a more general concern about the well-being of our children. This worry that vaccines might be "harming" a child rather than helping them hangs over parents' heads --- it's part of a more widespread concern among parents today about keeping children safe, or so writer Peggy Orenstein writes in the February 22nd &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/magazine/08wwln-lede-t.html"&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/magazine/08wwln-lede-t.html"&gt;The Toxic Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orenstein lives in the city I have an underriding affinity for, "smugly green hamlet" of granola-ness, Berkeley. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On learning that the air quality around Berkeley schools "fell in the lowest 10 percent," if not in the "bottom 1 percent," in the whole country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since December, when the report came out, the mayor, neighborhood activists and various parent-teacher associations have engaged in a sometimes-acrimonious, acronym-laced battle over its validity: over the culpability of the steel-casting factory on the western edge of town, over union jobs versus children’s health and over what, if anything, ought to be done. With all sides presenting their own experts throwing down the gauntlets of conflicting scientific studies, whom should parents believe? Is there truly a threat here, we asked one another as we dropped off our kids, and if so, how great is it? .................. this latest drama, repeated in various permutations in so many communities, is a crucible for how today’s parents perceive risk, how we try to keep our kids safe — whether it’s possible to keep them safe — in what feels like an increasingly threatening world. It raises the question of what, in our time, “safe” could even mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How "safe" can we make the world for our children; for ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orenstein notes that she applies "all-natural sun block" to her daughter's skin to protect her against skin cancer; fearful of mercury levels, she limits tuna. She writes: "Better safe than sorry, I say. But safe from what? And, more to the point, safe from which?" It's not so much the "concrete hazards" of  fire, car accidents, drowning that "go bump in the night," but those dangers that a parent can never fully "quantify"; can never fully even, perhaps, identify and point a finger at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "intuitive toxicology" is what &lt;a href="http://www.uoregon.edu"&gt;University of Oregon&lt;/a&gt; psychology professor Paul Slovic calls such a "skewed response." Orenstein continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, I wonder sometimes if avoiding the vinyl lunch box — I don’t care if it has “Hello Kitty” on the front — is just another blade in a helicopter parent’s propeller, another version of the overzealous monitoring that has produced kids who leave for college without ever having crossed the street by themselves. In this era when children symbolize emotional fulfillment rather than free household labor, we cling to the belief that if we just do everything right — starting with what a woman eats before she’s even pregnant — we can protect them from pain or failure or sadness. We can make them perfect and, in the process, prove ourselves beyond reproach. But of course, that control is illusory: even if it were possible to do everything “right,” it could still come out wrong. What if it wasn’t the creosote or the pesticide that gave me cancer but something even more frightening — plain old bad luck? What is a parent supposed to do about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our determination to make this world 100"-plus safe for our children, we may be overlooking something in our loving rush to "protect them from pain or failure or sadness." With all those products out there----the vitamins, the anti-bacterial skin creams, the sweet organic cotton outfits, the non-toxic toys, so much "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/health/nutrition/26food.html?ref=dining"&gt;good food&lt;/a&gt;"---surely (we think) we are making things better for our children. Surely we can "can make them perfect and, in the process, prove ourselves beyond reproach"-----but then what do we do when "plain old bad luck" steps in and we find ourselves the parent of a child who, however much we know they're perfect, get the evil eye from the world because she or he is..........different?  In a world where people talk about "&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/4206623/Designer-babies-Controversy-over-embryo-selection.html"&gt;designer embryos&lt;/a&gt;," woe all the more to the parent whose child is not even "normal." If we "know," or claim for sure, that we "did everything right," how can we account for a child who has a "problem" (i.e., autism)----surely something must have happened because, we parents swear, &lt;em&gt;we know we did everything right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the last sentence of Kirby's latest &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; piece: "Robert Kennedy, Jr. and I would love nothing more than to reassure parents that the nation's current vaccine program is 100% safe for all kids.....". The wish to protect "all kids" and keep them safe is herein invoked. And it's this wish to keep our kids safe, not only from diseases and pollution and whatever evil we fear is out there, that is one reason vaccines and autism indeed seem to be an &lt;a href="http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/labnotes/archive/2009/02/25/vaccines-and-autism-the-unending-story.aspx"&gt;unending story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as we try to make the world a green paradise for our children, why are we still haunted by that toxic paradox?&lt;/p&gt;

Now I wonder how he will pronounce all the other Stans in the region. (I think in my own dialect I pronounce &lt;em&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/em&gt; with all three &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;’s as in &lt;em&gt;father&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/em&gt; the way Obama did. But &lt;em&gt;Pakistan&lt;/em&gt; that way too.

&lt;p&gt;In the interests of what journalists call balance (but might better be called equal time for the Flat Earth Society), an article appeared straight after mine, &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/rachel-roberts-soh+refs--nhe-nov-dec-2008.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrating Homeopathy into Primary Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It was by Rachel Roberts “Research consultant for the Society of Homeopaths”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This defence was so appalling that I sent them a response (after first doing  a bit of checking on its author).  To my surprise, they published the response in full [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/colquhoun-placebo-fraud-NHE-Feb-2009.pdf"&gt;download pdf of printed version&lt;/a&gt;]. Their title was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/placebo-fraud.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the first step is to Google the author, to find out a bit more.  It seems that Rachel Roberts runs a business &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ihtraining.org/"&gt;Integrated Homeopathic Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. (a financial interest that was not mentioned  in her article).  She will  sell you flash cards (‘Matmedcards’) for £70 (+£9 p&amp;amp;p) for 120 cards (yes, seriously). The card for &lt;em&gt;Conium  maculatum &lt;/em&gt; is remarkable.  It says on the reverse side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://dcscience.net/matmedcard-pack2s.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="181"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it says (my emphasis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The poison used to execute Socrates.&lt;strong&gt; No  1 remedy for scirrhous breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;. Esp after blow to the breast”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt she would claim that the word “remedy” was a special weasel word of homeopaths that did not imply any therapeutic efficacy.  But its use in this context seems to me to be cruel deception, even murderous.  It also appears to breach the Cancer Act 1939, as well as the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=790"&gt;Unfair Trading laws&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the Bristol Trading Standards Office, and got a reply remarkably quickly. It ended thus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“.  .  .   .  the use of the card for “hemlock” as   an example amounts to advice in connection with the treatment (of cancer)”.    I will initially write to IHT and require that they remove this, and any  other, reference to cancer treatment from their website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I checked again a couple of weeks later, the hemlock sample card  had been been replaced by one about chamomile (it is described as the opium of homeopathy.  Luckily the pills contain no opium (and no chamomile either) or that would be breaking another law. Bafflingly, it is not  (yet) against the law to sell pills that contain no trace of the ingredient on the label, if they are labelled ‘homeopathic’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably the packs still contain a claim to cure cancer. And what is said in the privacy of the consulting room will never be known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political correctness is a curious thing.  I felt slightly guilty when I reported this breach of the Cancer Act.  It felt almost sneaky.  The feeling didn’t last long though.  We are talking about sick people here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t hard to imagine a desperate woman suffering from cancer reading that  Ms Roberts knows the “No 1 remedy for scirrhous breast cancer”.  She might actually believe it.  She might buy some hemlock pills that contain no hemlock (or anything else). She might die as a result. It is not a joke. It is, literally, deadly  serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also deadly serious that the Department of Health and some NHS managers are so stifled by political correctness that they refer to homeopaths as “professionals” and pay them money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ms Roberts, in her article, is at pains to point out that
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Registered members of the Society of Homeopaths (identified by the designation       RSHom) have met required standards of education, are fully insured and  have agreed to abide by a strict code of ethics and practice..”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/placebo-fraud-q1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well it is already well known that the &lt;a title="SoH web site" href="http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/about-the-society/documents/CodeofEthicsApr04.pdf"&gt;the Code of Ethics&lt;/a&gt; of the Society of Homeopaths is &lt;a href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/society-of-homeopaths-breach-own-code-of-ethics-on-website/"&gt;something of a  joke&lt;/a&gt;. This is just one more example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Code of Ethics, para 72 says homeopaths have a legal obligation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To avoid making claims (whether explicit or implied; orally or in writing) implying  cure of any named disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, perhaps, claiming to have the “No 1 remedy for scirrhous breast cancer”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/10/society-of-homeopaths-failure-of-self.html"&gt;voluntary self-regulation&lt;/a&gt; isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to go to her web site to find “claims  .  .  .  implying cure of any named disease”.  In &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/rachel-roberts-soh+refs--nhe-nov-dec-2008.pdf"&gt;her article&lt;/a&gt; she says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conditions which responded well to homeopathy included childhood eczema and asthma, migraine, menopausal problems, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, arthritis, depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt they will say that the claim that asthma and migraine “responded well” to  their sugar pills carries no suggestion that they can cure a named disease.  And if you believe that, you’ll believe anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I find Ms Robert’s article exceedingly puzzling.  It comes with 29 references, so it looks, to use Goldacre’s word, ‘sciencey’.  If you read the references, and more importantly, know about all the work that isn’t  referred to, you see it is the very opposite of science. I see only two options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either it is deliberate deception designed to make money, or it shows, to a mind-boggling extent, an inability to understand what constitutes evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter, more charitable, view is supported by the fact that Ms Roberts trots out, yet again, the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=198"&gt;infamous  2005 Spence paper&lt;/a&gt;, as though it constituted evidence for anything at all. In this paper 6544 patients at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital were asked if the felt better after attending the out-patient department.  Half of them reported that the felt ‘better’ or ‘much better’.  Another 20%  said they were ‘slightly better’ (but that is what you say to be nice to the doctor). The patients were not compared with any other group at all. What could be less surprising than that half of the relatively minor complaints that get referred for homeopathy get ‘better or much better’ on their own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of study can’t even tell you if homeopathic treatment has a placebo effect, never mind that it has a real effect of its own.  It is a sign of the desperation of homeopaths that they keep citing this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, the conclusion is clear.  Never seek advice from someone who has a financial interest in the outcome.  Ms Roberts makes her living from homeopathy. If she were to come to the same conclusion as  the rest of the world, that it is a placebo and a fraud, her income would vanish.  It is asking too much of anyone to do that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is the mistake made time and time again by the Department of Health and by the NHS.  The  &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;Pittilo report&lt;/a&gt; does the same thing   The execrably bad assessment of evidence in that report is, one suspects, not unrelated to the fact that it was done entirely by people who would lose their jobs if they were to come to any conclusion  other than their treatments work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/placebo-fraud-q2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present , the regulation of alternative medicine is chaotic because the government and the dozen or so different quangos involved are trying to regulate while avoiding the single most important question - do the treatments work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They should now grasp that nettle and refer the question to NICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;

Clearly this guy hasn’t read The Bible. If he had, he’d know that the proper punishment for a disobedient child is stoning them to death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name="18"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If a man have a     stubborn and rebellious son&lt;/em&gt;, which will not obey the voice of his     father, or the voice of his mother&lt;/span&gt;, and that, when they have chastened     him, will not hearken unto them:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name="19"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his     city&lt;/span&gt;, and unto the gate of his place;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name="20"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he     will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name="21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:&lt;/em&gt; so shalt thou put     evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear” (Deuteronomy 21:18-21).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the father only stabbed his son in the left buttock, so all’s well that ends with a sore ass, I suppose. I guess the lesson of the story is that if you’re a pain in the ass, you should be made to have a real pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;

Only after they listen to devil music do they suddenly feel the urge to do it. Well that’s what a new “study” that’s really just a survey would have us believe. Okay, I’m exaggerating a bit. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7906613.stm"&gt;The “study” claims it makes kids want to do it earlier&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier than what? I wonder if Mozart is on the list too because it was quite common for 12-year-olds to be married and having sex back in his day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Pittsburgh University quizzed 711 teenagers about their sex lives and music listening habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found those who regularly listened to music with explicit and aggressive sexual phrases were twice as likely to be having sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, did it occur to them that it might just be that kids having sex were twice as likely to listen to music that relates to their already sexually active lives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers refused to name which songs would fall into the degrading category, but cited phrases such as “I’m gonna beat that pussy up” as the kind of lyrics that were being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would think? I know I thought the types of kids who listened to music with lyrics like that would be rather prudish.&lt;/p&gt;

In the comments section of his article you can see one of our christian guests using some other common heuristics which I've taken a moment to analyze. I welcome William, and I hope he'll consider joining DC as an author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a list of some of the heuristics William handled in his post:&lt;br&gt;Criticism: You’re anti-religious or anti-Christian.&lt;br&gt;Criticism: You are trying to lead people away from God and/or Jesus Christ&lt;br&gt;Criticism: You’ve confused the sinfulness of man with a perfect God.&lt;br&gt;Criticism: You were never really a serious Christian, so you didn’t really lose your faith, you never had it.&lt;br&gt;Criticism: You’ve consigned yourself to an eternity in hell&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the comments section of that article one of our guests used quite a few common heuristics laying them out nicely for an opportunity for analysis. In my view these heuristics are the result of various cognitive biases and unskilled thinking.  A couple of Good books on that sort of thing are "How We Know What Isn't So" by Thomas Gilovich and "How To Think About Weird Things" by Theodore Schick and Lewis Vaughn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;BLAMING THE VICTIM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"no you have not lost your faith – just exchanged it. "&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This depends on belief being a voluntary action.  Try believing that the sun won't come up tomorrow, or the sun will not set around the time its forecast.  I can't do it, and I don't think anyone else can either.  One can commit to an idea, but that is completely different than having a belief or an emotional investment in it.  I can say "Sir" or "Ma'am" completely independent of whether I think its deserved or not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One practical test of whether belief is inherently "rational" is to look through trivia game cards and choose the right answer from four or five options.  Sometimes there will be one that the observer thinks right away could be the answer, then see another that the observer "feels" more likely to be  the right answer.  Then the observer is wrong and it was the one the observer thought before but didn't feel right.  This kind of thing happens to me all the time.  Belief, for the most part, is not consciously controlled, if at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Without proof absolute either way to believe there is no God is as much of a leap of faith (more in my opinion) as to believe there is a God."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lack of proof of something SHOULD cause a belief that a real world state is not being accurately described by the data.  The commenter seems to say that the belief that the datum is unlikely given the lack of evidence is EQUIVALENT to believing it without evidence. The quality of the evidence is relevant only to the observer.  The evidence may foster a belief in some people but not in others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is appropriate to doubt a datum that lacks support, it is NOT appropriate to commit to a datum that lacks support. The commenter faults the apostate for appropriately doubting the datum on the grounds that the evidence does not nurture, support, cause, sustain or warrant his belief.  Therefore the commenter faults the apostate for not ARTIFICIALLY sustaining his emotional investment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I really think you are taking cheap (and intellectually weak) shots at the religion that has not met your expectations – by the way, did you meet Christ’s expectations of you?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This depends on the apostates expectations being inappropriate.  Were the apostates expectations inappropriate?  If the apostates expectations were based on sound principles in support of the apostates value system then how can it be inappropriate?  What expectations does the apostate have that is inappropriate?  I think its safe to say that apostates are apostates because the evidence doesn't nurture, support, cause, sustain or warrant their belief.  If the only definitive proof is some inner knowing about God, then if God is of One Mind, this inner knowing should be consistent across people and multiple denominations of Christianity are evidence that its not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE "TU QUOQUE" FALLACY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"But why should we expect more of Christians and their institutions than of secular organizations?" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Secular organizations do it too!"&lt;br&gt;Is it inappropriate to fault something because other things exhibit the same behavior. But it can be appropriate to fault things even though the behavior is exhibited by the speaker.  Should I NOT reprimand my child for vulgar language even though I do it too?  My child has every right to reprimand me, and to further reprimand me for not being consistent.  In this case, how Secular organizations behave has no bearing on how Christian organizations should behave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CIRCULAR ARGUMENT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"it is rational to expect Christianity to attract more than its fair share – where else would they go in an unforgiving world?" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This presumes Christians are in a constant state of "recovery" from their sin.  The guest concludes that there are more "sinners" in church exactly because "sinners" see church as place they can go to help overcome their "sin".  Therefore it should be expected that one would find "sinners" in church. After all, people that go into an Ice Cream shop have a desire for and are lacking ice cream, so we would expect to find people lacking ice cream in the ice cream shop.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The missing qualifier in that reasoning scheme which disconfirms it and which is the qualifier that breaks the circle is the effectiveness of the ice cream shop in providing Ice Cream.  People do get their ice cream because the ice cream shop is effective at selling it to them.  So if customers of ice cream never left the store, we should see more of the customers that have had ice cream, and can get it anytime they want and less of those that want it, do not have it and have not had it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll concede that we are all in constant state of recovery from undesirable human behavior.  That is what education and learning how to associate in a society is all about.  But this leads to the question of HOW EFFECTIVE CHRISTIANITY IS at dealing with undesirable Human Behavior (Sin) compared to other methods.  When you assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Christianity on dealing with undesirable human behavior, its evident that it has no advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"[the apostate says] 'I indeed was a serious Christian' Well you certainly went through some of the motions!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This asserts that though the apostates behavior was consistent with a true believer, his apostasy proves that he never really believed at all.  This missing qualifier which disconfirms the statement and breaks the circle is the intent behind the actions.  What benefit would the NON-BELIEVER have in ACTING LIKE A BELIEVER?  Obviously to act like a Christian is a result of believing oneself to be a Christian or believing their is some benefit to pretending to be a Christian.  To say that someone pretended to be a Christian for over a decade and then decided to renounce it and advertise it requires some forethought and premeditation to what benefit?  To put oneself into an undesirable minority?  Not bloody likely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SLIDING WINDOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"have fallen into what seems to be a common atheist trap on giving up religion – finding in the literalistic interpretation of the bible anything that can be criticised." &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The guests seems to be saying that though the Bible is the revealed word of God, it shouldn't be taken at face value.  Its only accurate so far, but they won't define any parameters.  Bring some parameters for how to measure what is an accurate representation of a real world state and what is not to the table and there might be a case for a non-literal interpretation.  As it stands, it is not clear that the author of the scripture did not intend for it to be taken literally except where there is an obvious use of metaphor such as in the case of parables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Given the social context of His time there were many things Jesus did not directly seek out against – capital punishment etc."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This seems to presume that it was somehow inappropriate for God on Earth to speak out against slavery, or not killing witches.  If Jesus was God on Earth, then in order to Qualify as God he must have been the ultimate authority, so how would it have been inappropriate?  Is it NOT a sound principle that the most qualified should lead, or that the authority should exercise that authority, or that beings should be prevented from intentionally or otherwise harming themselves or others?  To make the guests claim tenable the criteria for appropriate behavior in an authority and the criteria for appropriate behavior by the observer of suffering must be modified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SELF-CENTERED STANDARD FOR CHRISTIANITY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The problem you seem to have faced was that when you realized God was not in the beliefs you held you seem to have decided there is no God rather than that God might be different from what you believed or wanted Him to be."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the old "I Got Mine, Why Can't You Get Yours?" argument.  If the apostate understood Christianity the way our guest understands it, the apostate would still be a believer. Meaning that if the Apostate would ignore disconfirming qualifiers in the standard Christian reasoning schemes, then they would still be a believer.

But soon &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7908866.stm"&gt;the nation’s policy on lingerie shop staff may all change&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way that underwear is being sold in Saudi Arabia is simply not acceptable to any population living anywhere in the modern world,” says Reem Asaad, a finance lecturer at Dar al-Hikma Women’s College in Jeddah, who is leading a campaign to get women working in lingerie shops rather than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a sensitive part of women’s bodies,” adds Ms Asaad. “You need to have some discussions regarding size, colour and attractive choices and you definitely don’t want to get into such a discussion with a stranger, let alone a male stranger. I mean this is something I wouldn’t even talk to my friends about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court is scheduled today (25 Feb 2009) to hear arguments (&lt;em&gt;Flores-Figueroa v. U.S.&lt;/em&gt;, No. 08-108) to decide whether Ignacio Flores-Figueroa should have his conviction for &lt;em&gt;aggravated identity theft&lt;/em&gt; reversed. The debate centers on the interpretation of a statute, 18 U.S.C. sec. 1028A(a)(1), which states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whoever … knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person shall … be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts of the case are undisputed: in 2006, Mr. Flores-Figueroa purchased a forged Social Security card and resident alien card in his own name but with numbers that were not assigned to him by the relevant authorities. His employer, a steel plant in East Moline, Illinois, submitted these numbers to the federal authorities, who determined that the numbers had been issued to other people. Mr. Flores-Figueroa pleaded not guilty to aggravated identity theft, saying that &amp;quot;he didn&amp;#39;t know that the ID numbers belonged to anyone&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/opinion/25wed2.html?ref=todayspaper"&gt;And Unequal Justice for Some&lt;/a&gt;, editorial, New York Times, 25 Feb 2009) but was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question before the Court boils down to the scope of the adverb &lt;em&gt;knowingly&lt;/em&gt;: as a law professor friend of mine put it, the question is &amp;quot;whether the term &amp;#39;knowingly&amp;#39; modifies just &amp;#39;uses&amp;#39; or also &amp;#39;of another person&amp;#39;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a point of grammar, adverbs modify &lt;b&gt;verb phrases&lt;/b&gt;, not just verbs. This can be seen pretty clearly by considering the havoc that would arise if &amp;quot;just verbs&amp;quot; could the target of modification. Consider the sentence in (1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Oedipus knowingly married his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could ignore the object of the verb, and take &lt;em&gt;knowingly&lt;/em&gt; to modify just &lt;em&gt;marry&lt;/em&gt;, (1) should be ambiguous; on one reading, (1) should be equivalent to (2):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Oedipus knowingly married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course while Oedipus did knowingly marry, he didn't know Jocasta was his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, we can't just ignore some part of the object either (as is implied by wondering whether &lt;em&gt;knowingly&lt;/em&gt; applies also to &amp;quot;of another person&amp;quot;); consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Oedipus knowingly married a woman who was his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if we could just ignore the relative clause &lt;em&gt;who was his mother&lt;/em&gt;, the sentence in (3) could mean the same thing as (4):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Oedipus knowingly married a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that would be silly. (3) does not equal (4). The same applies to the verb &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; of course, to which the adverb &lt;em&gt;knowingly&lt;/em&gt; is related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) Oedipus knows he married a woman who is his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) Oedipus knows he married a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, (5) ≠ (6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that the confusion arose because of a sloppy way of speaking that exists, which is to say things like &amp;quot;an adverb modifies a verb&amp;quot;. This is wrong. And because adverbs modify verb phrases, not just verbs, the object of the verb can&amp;#39;t be ignored, nor can some arbitrary subpart of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might also be led into this confusion by an earlier decision: &amp;quot;In a 1985 case, quoting a treatise on criminal law, the Supreme Court summed up the problem this way: &amp;#39;It is not at all clear how far down the sentence the word &lt;em&gt;knowingly&lt;/em&gt; is intended to travel.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/washington/21scotus.html?_r=1"&gt;Justices Take Case on Illegal Workers and Penalties for Identity Theft&lt;/a&gt;, Adam Liptak, New York Times, 20 Oct 2008.) Sounds like the Supreme Court is endorsing syntactic movement! And not just movement, but covert movement at that (&amp;quot;Supreme Court Decides in Favor of QR&amp;quot;). But that 1985 decision really was about a structural ambiguity between two adjuncts (one before and one after the VP), and doesn&amp;#39;t bear on the identity theft statute here at all. It was parallel to another case whose outcome rode on a structural ambiguity in the language of the statute: &amp;quot;this crime covers anyone who intentionally accesses a federal computer without authorization,    and by means of one or more instances of such conduct alters, damages, or destroys information&amp;quot; (18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5)(A) debated in &lt;em&gt;United States v. Morrison&lt;/em&gt;; brought to my attention by a linguistics BA who went on to law school and put his training to good use). In this latter case, the question is whether the adverb &lt;i&gt; intentionally&lt;/i&gt; is attached to only the first VP or whether it is attached to the conjunction of the two VPs. The defendant argued in favor of the wide scope reading, while the government argued for the local attachment (the judge agreed with the government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004602" title=""&gt;Leptin Affects Life History Decisions in a Passerine Bird: A Field Experiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Organisms face trade-offs regarding their life-history strategies, such as decisions of single or multiple broods within a year. In passerines displaying facultative multiple breeding, the probability of laying a second clutch is influenced by several life-history factors. However, information about the mechanistic background of these trade-offs is largely lacking. Leptin is a protein hormone produced by white fat cells, and acts as a signal between peripheral energy depots and the central nervous system. In addition, leptin affects cells at all levels of the reproductive axis and plays a critical role in regulating the allocation of metabolic energy to reproduction. As such, it is possible that leptin levels influence the decision of whether or not to invest time and energy into a second clutch. Accordingly, we expect a treatment with exogenous leptin to result in an increased number of second broods. At a later stage during the first brood, female great tits were treated either with long-term leptin-filled cholesterol pellets (the experimental birds) or with pellets containing only cholesterol (the control birds). We found that leptin-treated females were significantly more likely to have a second brood and that the earlier females were more likely to lay a second clutch than the late females. As both timing of first brood and treatment with leptin were important in the decision of having multiple broods, the trade-offs involved in the breeding strategy most likely depend on multiple factors. Presumably leptin has evolved as a signal of energy supply status to regulate the release of reproductive hormones so that reproduction is coordinated with periods of sufficient nutrients. This study investigated the role of leptin as a mediator between energy resources and reproductive output, providing a fundamentally new insight into how trade-offs work on a functional basis.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004611" title=""&gt;Universal Artifacts Affect the Branching of Phylogenetic Trees, Not Universal Scaling Laws&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The superficial resemblance of phylogenetic trees to other branching structures allows searching for macroevolutionary patterns. However, such trees are just statistical inferences of particular historical events. Recent meta-analyses report finding regularities in the branching pattern of phylogenetic trees. But is this supported by evidence, or are such regularities just methodological artifacts? If so, is there any signal in a phylogeny? In order to evaluate the impact of polytomies and imbalance on tree shape, the distribution of all binary and polytomic trees of up to 7 taxa was assessed in tree-shape space. The relationship between the proportion of outgroups and the amount of imbalance introduced with them was assessed applying four different tree-building methods to 100 combinations from a set of 10 ingroup and 9 outgroup species, and performing covariance analyses. The relevance of this analysis was explored taking 61 published phylogenies, based on nucleic acid sequences and involving various taxa, taxonomic levels, and tree-building methods. All methods of phylogenetic inference are quite sensitive to the artifacts introduced by outgroups. However, published phylogenies appear to be subject to a rather effective, albeit rather intuitive control against such artifacts. The data and methods used to build phylogenetic trees are varied, so any meta-analysis is subject to pitfalls due to their uneven intrinsic merits, which translate into artifacts in tree shape. The binary branching pattern is an imposition of methods, and seldom reflects true relationships in intraspecific analyses, yielding artifactual polytomies in short trees. Above the species level, the departure of real trees from simplistic random models is caused at least by two natural factors -uneven speciation and extinction rates; and artifacts such as choice of taxa included in the analysis, and imbalance introduced by outgroups and basal paraphyletic taxa. This artifactual imbalance accounts for tree shape convergence of large trees. There is no evidence for any universal scaling in the tree of life. Instead, there is a need for improved methods of tree analysis that can be used to discriminate the noise due to outgroups from the phylogenetic signal within the taxon of interest, and to evaluate realistic models of evolution, correcting the retrospective perspective and explicitly recognizing extinction as a driving force. Artifacts are pervasive, and can only be overcome through understanding the structure and biological meaning of phylogenetic trees.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_129.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/DF7jGP75OzA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235618851128"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4936235062768853684">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d39acce918b18d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Debunking Christianity is Ranked 13th Among Atheist Sites From More Accurate Polling Numbers</title><published>2009-02-26T03:21:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T03:22:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/Ex7vuzxR35Y/debunking-christianity-is-ranked-13th.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/4936235062768853684/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=4936235062768853684" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/debunking-christianity-is-ranked-13th.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://atheistblogger.com/rankings/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.

OK.)  I've been, once again, incredibly lax in my posting due to an unforeseen illness and just damn life gettin' in the way of my internet life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, I just read (listened to, actually) Neil deGrasse-Tyson's new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Pluto-Files-Neil-Tyson/dp/0393065200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1235612548&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Pluto Files&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a fun book that tells all about Pluto's discovery and subsequent demotion plus all the furor that ensued after the &lt;a href="http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/"&gt;Hayden Planetarium's&lt;/a&gt; display which ostensibly "forgot" Pluto.  I found it &lt;i&gt;slightly&lt;/i&gt; repetitive, but not necessarily in a bad way - there were a couple of times when I was listening when I thought, "did I hit &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; or something?"  Apart from that, though, it was quite fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While listening to some of the feedback Tyson received, the main thought I had was, &lt;i&gt;"Holy crap, it's amazing that people seriously have opinions that strong about a subject they have very little knowledge about and that has essentially zero effect on their lives."&lt;/i&gt;  Much of it revolved around the subject of, &lt;i&gt;"well, Pluto was a planet when I was young, that's how I was taught, and that's how I'm staying."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a window into how normal (read: non-scientific) people think.  The majority of folks are told/taught something and then that's that.  No more thought necessary because the ol' mind's made up.  It shines a light on why many - most, likely - people think that the cornerstone of science, the fact that all knowledge is tentative, is a weakness.  I believe educators call that a "teachable moment".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a good book, although I have to say that I enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Black-Hole-Cosmic-Quandaries/dp/0393330168/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1235615552&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Death by Black Hole&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more.  Check either out if you have the means.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;TAMs are the premier conferences for critical thinkers across the globe. Hosted by the James Randi Education Foundation (JREF), it always features great speakers, good times, and a warm and wonderful community. TAM 7 will continue that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, our keynote speaker is Bill Prady, the executive producer of &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;. Suh. Weet. We also have Randi, of course, My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage&amp;amp;#153, Jennifer Ouellette, Joe Nickell, Michael Shermer, Emily Rosa, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/448-the-amazing-meeting-7-speakers.html"&gt;and a passel of other great speakers&lt;/a&gt;. I guess that means me, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/449-the-amazing-meeting-7-events.html"&gt;We have all sorts of plans for this one&lt;/a&gt;. We have workshops, paper presentations, magic shows, music (George Hrab! W00t!), and even… a talent show. Yes, really. Do skeptics have talent? We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first TAM as JREF President, and I want to see lots and lots of BABloggees there. Who’s with me? TAM 7 will be from July 9 - 12 at the South Point Hotel, Casino, &amp;amp; Spa in Las Vegas, Nevada.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was kind of taken aback by the way volcanic monitoring was portrayed in the speech," Brad Singer, a professor of geology at the University of Wisconsin, said. "Every once in awhile there's some odd science research going on that sounds so out there that it's not useful and even I can laugh at some of those. But volcano monitoring is a serious business. I would say there are hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who live in the sphere of hazard associated with many individual volcanoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's work to help predict and prevent disasters. You would think the governor of Louisiana would understand why this is important, even if his state doesn't have volcanoes, but one thing we've learned over the last few years is that Republican presidential candidates don't have much of a connection with reality or empathy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/jindal_continues_a_tradition.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/XwjdGjRSXOI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235611935238"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/great-customer-service-pip-printing-palo-alto.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/13d378a4a5307467</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stories About Me"/><title type="html">Great Customer Service: PIP Printing, Palo Alto</title><published>2009-02-26T01:29:31Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T01:29:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/great-customer-service-pip-printing-palo-alto.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been deep in getting the program for &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/01/jacques-littlefields-memorial-service-monday-march-2-4-pm.html"&gt;Jacques Littlefield&amp;#39;s memorial service &lt;/a&gt;produced and printed.  It&amp;#39;s been a somewhat exasperating task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The folks at &lt;a href="http://pippaloalto.rtrk.com/?scid=892455&amp;amp;kw=1935856"&gt;PIP Palo Alto,&lt;/a&gt; particularly &lt;a href="http://www.maystead.com/"&gt;Mike Maystead &lt;/a&gt;and Kat Sison, could not have been more helpful.  I particularly want to thank Kat, who soaked up my frustration and ill-temper with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235611868956"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/25/ets/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/34c437173a1f5caf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellany"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">ETs</title><published>2009-02-26T01:27:38Z</published><updated>2009-02-26T01:27:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/25/ets/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went and watched &lt;a href="http://www.tedprize.org/jill-tarter/watch-jill-tarter-share-her-ted-prize-wish/"&gt;Jill Tarter’s acceptance speech&lt;/a&gt; for her &lt;a href="http://www.tedprize.org/"&gt;TED Prize&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.  I’ve been aware of Jill’s work for a long while now, and have been a (somewhat silent fan).  But I was unaware of the TED prize until it came up in &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/541/"&gt;xkcd.com&lt;/a&gt;.  (Kudos to xkcd for that!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the grand view she takes of the universe and our place in it.  She eloquently points out the  fact that swirls of gas and dust have collapsed and developed into a form which is aware of itself and wonders where it comes from, and whether it’s alone.   When you think about it like that, it’s a little unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is hard to imagine a more profound discovery than to definitively prove that there is sentient life elsewhere in the universe, perhaps relatively close to our little spot in the suburbs of the Milky Way.  Science fiction has for decades explored the many possibilities of the forms that such life might take.  Movies and TV have focused mostly on the humanoid forms since the costumes are easy.  One might make arguments about the typical strength of materials relative to the gravity of habitable planets, etc., and about convergent evolution.   But to me it seems exceedingly unlikely that intelligent life elsewhere has two legs, two arms, or even a head like ours.  It would seem to me to be a long shot that they are RNA/DNA based, or even based on amino acids and proteins.  It could be they they are tiny, and have a hive-like culture.  Or they could be vast stadium-sized creatures who live for millennia and float in their densely gaseous outer planetary layers.   The possibilities are endless.  The chance that they are anything like us, though, seems truly remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here are a few things we can say relatively confidently about intelligent/sentient/technical beings elsewhere that we may some day detect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. They are made out of the same kinds of atoms and molecules that we find here, possibly including&lt;br&gt;
iron/cobalt/nickel, other metals, and lighter atoms like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and on and on. These atoms came from the explosions of the first stars in their final death throes, and that’s what’s out there to make life from.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. They need energy to survive, and may have learned how (as we have) to access alternative sources of energy to drive their technology.  Some of these sources may be entirely unknown to us (yet - that’s one reason why we need to keep pushing the high energy frontier) but available all around us if we just knew what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. They almost certainly use ordinary electromagnetism and the nuclear forces in their technology, which is based on the ordinary matter from #1.  Clearly light, and all the other forms of electromagnetic radiation are so ubiquitous it is hard to imagine they’ve overlooked it.  Similarly for the nuclear forces.  This is our doorway into ordinary matter at reasonable temperatures.  (This having been said, humans on earth only recently started to learn how to control these forces.   And, given #2, maybe the aliens have moved on to better things.)  Their electromagnetic emanations, anyway, are just about our only hope of detecting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. They are almost certainly either far older, and more developed than we are, or far younger and more primitive.  Humanity has only been truly self aware, and headed toward advanced technology, in the very recent past, perhaps the last few hundred thousand years.  Compared with billions of years, this is a tiny slice of time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. They are very, very far away and it would take an excessively long time for them to cross the vast distances between stars.  (I view faster-than-light travel or communication as a non-possibility, practically speaking, for even the most advanced life forms.  I know this is not going to make me popular with the alien fans out there, but outer space is really, really big.)  It takes light many thousands of years to cross the vast stretches of space.   You have to really want to go interstellar if that’s what you’re about, and you have to abandon the rest of your society and all the support you get from it once you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the bottom line is that even if we found aliens by peering out into space with our detectors, we may realize they are out there, but they are probably not coming here.  Somehow that makes me feel more lonely, not less.  And if they did come here their technology is so advanced that they would hardly regard us as worth of any sort of interest or notice.  Our planet might have some interest for them in terms of resources to exploit, but that is probably about it.  We’d just be in the way, at best.  We can forget about communicating with them…let’s just hope they don’t want our protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, give Jill a listen she is very eloquent on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

(In exchange for money, of course.)  It’s sprinkled with gems like this, in the article on “Differential Topology” by my former professor &lt;a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~chtaubes/"&gt;Clifford Taubes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are with me so far, suppose now that an advanced alien en route from Arcturus to the galactic center kidnaps you and drops you into some unknown, 2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional manifold.  You suspect that it is &lt;em&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; x &lt;em&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but you are not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on, the screenplay practically writes itself!  I’m seeing Ewan McGregor, maybe Natalie Portman.  Russell Crowe as the alien.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/18/seex/"&gt;SEEx&lt;/a&gt; could help with some of the mathy stuff.  If any studio executives are reading this, call me, I’d be happy to bang out a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the book is great fun, and as Scott says it’s surprisingly readable.  Not really a popularization; neither equations nor high-level abstractions are shied away from.  (After months of jousting with the “grammar checker” in Microsoft Word, I now deploy sentence fragments and the passive voice out of sheer spite.)  But put into the hands of the right ambitious high-school student, it could be life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s.  You haven’t really lived until you’ve seen Cliff Taubes do his little dance to illustrate the concept of “quantum fluctuations.”&lt;/p&gt;

Art and music are great examples of languages that do not have to be spoken to be conveyed."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art is firmly on my Interests list; it's no coincidence I post often about art.  I've been expressing myself visually since as far back as I can remember.  In this word-based medium here it's hard to tell, but my day-to-day, in-person communication is managed in a large part through diagrams and images; the first question I ask before every meeting is whether a whiteboard is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Gazette posted a story &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.net/stories/02192009/collnew172506_32478.shtml"&gt;Autistic student turns to comics to express herself&lt;/a&gt; about Alice Umoh, a 12-year-old with an AS diagnosis who is an avid comic book writer.  Creating comics, an art that combines visual and literary languages, is currently Alice's passion, and she is, according to the article, quite effective at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loudountimes.com/news/2009/feb/25/sharing-spotlight/"&gt;Sharing the spotlight&lt;/a&gt; from the Loudoun Times-Mirror in Virginia is about a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vsa_arts_serious_and_inclusive_art"&gt;Very Special Arts&lt;/a&gt; theatrical troop.  (The article includes a a nice bit of social commentary on how disability is treated in society, "ranging from the very cruel and abusive to the very enlightened and nurturing," with the note the VSA theatre troop takes the more enlightened path.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP) in Canada, has an &lt;a href="http://www.taaproject.com/taapestry/gallery/"&gt;online gallary of visual arts&lt;/a&gt;, including artists such as &lt;a href="http://myclassiclifefilm.com/"&gt;Larry Bissonnette&lt;/a&gt; who use visual expression as a major component of their communication.  Donna Williams has a wide range of artistic expressions, including the &lt;a href="http://www.donnawilliams.net/artist.0.html"&gt;visual&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.donnawilliams.net/music.0.html"&gt;musical&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/1210donna"&gt;cinoematical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artistic mediums each have their own language, the language of mark-making, of composition, of movement, of sound and silence.  These languages have been a powerful tool for expression and communication since the earliest know points in human history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while an analogy comes along that deserves wide dissemination.  I got one such this afternoon on the Ohio Citizens for Science list, and I’ve got permission to quote it from Joe Hern, its author.  Joe was musing on the &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1539247884380533350&amp;amp;hl=en" rel="external "&gt;video of Michael Schermer interviewing Georgia Purdom&lt;/a&gt;, creationist geneticist at AIG.  (I don’t know how long that URL will be good, so grab it if you want it.)   Joe, who IIRC is a former YEC himself, captured the creationist mindset perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychology behind why Creationists seem to make up stuff that fit their theology is best understood by recognizing precisely how we feel when we see a magician pull a rabbit from its hat in a magic show. We do not need to know how it works to “know” it is not really magic. We do not entertain ideas that we may be ‘missing’ a step in our epistemology. We would roll our eyes at anyone who insists to us we are not thinking critically to accept that there may be true magic involved. The key component of this thought process is that we ‘know’ we do not have to look into it… it’s a foregone
conclusion that there is no magic involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the creationist, this is the exact same thought process.  They ‘know’ God is real, that what he wrote is literal, and there is no reason whatsoever to even begin to entertain the idea that the ‘evidences’ for evolution are really evidence. It’s a foregone conclusion that such ‘evidences’, regardless how intellectual or damning they sound, are “simply” ways man makes data fit their own ideas, as Dr. Purdom stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said it best when (the only part in her talking with which I agreed) she said that once a Christian moves away from the scriptures in one area (the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, etc) then it is a slippery slope to using the same kind of logic about Mary being a virgin and giving birth or Jesus rising from the dead. I will add other biblical claims as well, such as the miracles of Jesus, his divinity, and the existence of God himself. In fact, Dr. Purdom’s point is one used by many former Christians (now atheists) who wonder why some Christians believe some of the stuff in the bible, but
ignore other aspects of it. Nonetheless, Dr. Purdom goes the opposite direction by saying one must accept that evolution is not real since it’s already a fact that the virgin birth and Jesus’ resurrection occurred.  “Clearly” there is no issue with agreeing that Adam and Eve began the human race ~4000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That really is what we’re up against: presuppositionalist thinking &lt;em&gt;vs.&lt;/em&gt; evidential thinking, in Purdom’s terms.  As I remarked in my &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/i-want-aig-crea.html" rel=""&gt;AIG creationists on the jury post&lt;/a&gt; last week, for creationists evidence is not a means of testing presuppositions: evidence &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be interpreted so as to corroborate them or one will fall into apostasy.   Therefore any ‘interpretation’ of the evidence that doesn’t corroborate them is a false and mistaken interpretation, and to accept such a false interpretation is to risk one’s salvation and that of one’s children.  (For more on creationist fears in this respect see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/05/creationist-fea.html#more" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/05/the-fear-of-evo.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America.   

&lt;p&gt;In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity - it is a pre-requisite.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma.  And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education.  We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation.  And half of the students who begin college never finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow.  That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education - from the day they are born to the day they begin a career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan.  We have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life.  We have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students.  And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know that our schools don't just need more resources.  They need more reform.  That is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success.  We'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps.  And we will expand our commitment to charter schools.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work.  But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it.  And so tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training.  This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship.  But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma.  And dropping out of high school is no longer an option.  It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country - and this country needs and values the talents of every American.  That is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal:  by 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education.  And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask this Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country - Senator Edward Kennedy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children.  But it is up to us to ensure they walk through them.  In the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the TV, put away the video games, and read to their child.  I speak to you not just as a President, but as a father when I say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm generally heartened by these remarks, but of course, I have some thoughts of my own to add.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/president_obama_on_education.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/president_obama_on_education.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/IuxxkCub6ak" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235605178561"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/liberty-orange-marzipan-yoghur/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78a89c9f40461208</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">liberty orange marzipan yoghur…</title><published>2009-02-25T23:20:25Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T23:20:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/liberty-orange-marzipan-yoghur/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;liberty orange marzipan yoghurt is quite possibly the best yoghurt ever&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235603984890"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4073">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e8937bd9a17dd2da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="price theory"/><title type="html">Hate Surcharges?

I am setting off for a trip to what everyone (following Europe) calls the Far East.  (For Californians it is clearly the far west.) I head first to Hong Kong, for a few days during which I will be giving at least four lectures, and a panel session, and various other meetings (this really is not leisure time).  And there is just one thing that really, really scares me about it.  Perhaps you can guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really scared of that feeling of being a total illiterate.  You see, I unfortunately learned to read while I was three.  So I simply have no memories of a stage in life when I was not able to read — to puzzle out every piece of script I saw.  Some people have memories of being intelligent people who hadn&amp;#39;t mastered reading yet.  I don&amp;#39;t.  I could always read English.  Later I learned a bit of various European languages, and mastered the Greek alphabet, and a bit of Cyrillic, and I have even studied the Korean writing system a little, so almost everywhere I have ever been I can at least read the street signs, and pronounce the headlines in the newspapers (even if I can&amp;#39;t translate them), and choose items from a menu with some hopes of knowing what I&amp;#39;m doing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major exceptions are Japan and China.  I have been to Japan already, and I felt the chill of illiteracy fear as soon as I arrived. I cannot make head or tail out of written Japanese.  And Chinese is worse. In countries using writing systems this complex, I am a baby once again. I have to be led around by minders, and if they ever let go of my hand I panic.  I once got lost 200 yards from my hotel in Tokyo.  Without the textual labels I couldn't recognize a single street.  My minders have to look out for me, find me, take me to the lecture room, and choose my food for me.  I feel so vulnerable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of me, Language Log readers.  Pray for me, if you have religious contact with a god who responds to your prayerful activities and covers the Far East.  I am going out there to be an utter, babyish, blundering illiterate for nine days.  There are Language Log regulars like Bill Poser and Victor Mair who could have helped me if they were coming too, but they were not free.  I will be out there alone, an ashamed illiterate adult facing the horror of a universe of ideograms, every shop window sign (like the fabled message from a postmodernist mafia don in the old joke) making me an offer I can't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I know, I know, the characters are not really ideograms, in the strict sense of being single-symbol depictions of concepts; one or two commenters point this out below.  But the point is that for me, it makes no difference whether they are or not.  They are unintelligible to me.  They are a communicative medium that I cannot penetrate at all.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

The recent winner of the &lt;a href="http://www.wnewhouseawards.com/Pages/About.html"&gt;Wynn Newhouse Award&lt;/a&gt; for artists with disabilities---one of her paintings will be exhibited next month at the &lt;a href="http://www.vsarts.org/x5972.xml"&gt;VSA Armory Show&lt;/a&gt; in New York---Miller says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think of autism as a gift because it gives me an excellent attention to detail.  I'm able to stay in my studio for really long periods and not notice anything else.  I'm very sensitive to color, to detail, to line and shape and that really helps my art."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt some will hasten to pronounce on Miller's statement for her positive view of autism with comments about how that's all very well for her, but not for those with a "severe" autism diagnosis. This is perhaps inevitable; putting the words "positive" and "autism" together has been known to spark &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10_autism_controversies"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; (and all the more when some refer to autism as a "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html"&gt;radioactive&lt;/a&gt;" word). But it's what Miller also says in her &lt;a href="http://www.artistkatiemiller.com/"&gt;artist's statement&lt;/a&gt; about her work that strikes a particular note in me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My current body of work comments on the relationship between the mundane and the surreal, and how it relates to changing contemporary and romantic notions of childhood. My work explores the fine line between the disturbing and the comforting, the innocent and the provocative, the powerful and the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children and babies are depicted in Miller's &lt;a href="http://www.artistkatiemiller.com/images/Current%20Work/"&gt;current work&lt;/a&gt;; of the babies---newborns, she notes that "Newborns have a gawky, awkward imperfection, not unlike that of adolescents. I'm struck by Miller's grouping of the "gawky, awkward imperfection" of newborns to that of adolescents;  "gawky" and "awkward" are words that could describe my son, finding himself in a rapidly growing and changing &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;adolescent&lt;/a&gt; body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Miller's &lt;a href="http://www.artistkatiemiller.com/paintings.htm"&gt;paintings&lt;/a&gt; suggest those pairings of the "mundane and surreal," "the disturbing and the comforting, the innocent and the provocative, the powerful and the vulnerable." Not only are these conflicting feelings that one might feel towards newborns (and in the newborns as painted in oil by Miller) but they seem to be the feeling registered on the faces and body languages of random individuals towards my son, as he's now older and now that his being disabled is more immediately noted. "Mundane" and "surreal" particularly captures something about our days, I must say, thinking one moment about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_plumbing_issue"&gt;plumbing&lt;/a&gt; and the next about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/tlas_like_asd_add_and_dsm"&gt;what autism might be according to the DSM-V&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_autism_whitehousegov"&gt;presidential policy&lt;/a&gt; all while running up a hill in freezing cold wind with Charlie hurrying ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's a sign of some sort of progress in understanding when you realize, they're interrelated; that the surreal is a mundane matter, and what seems mundane and boring to most (that walk that Charlie and I take a couple nights a week on the quiet boulevard of our condo development) is something out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

And why does no-one ever point out that the minute they pour it into a glass, kettle or pot of dried lentils, all the effort to purify it has gone out the window?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company I'd like to introduce you to is &lt;a href="http://www.pureh2o.co.uk/"&gt;PureH20&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, the interweb has ensured that '2' rarely gets to be subscript.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The website has a myriad of bullshit, fear-mongering, pseudoscience and amazing state-the-bleedin-obvious facts like&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Water is absolutely vital for health&lt;/blockquote&gt; I would honestly like to know if there is anyone to whom that comes as a revelation. And I mean anyone in the whole world.&lt;br&gt;Did you know that&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;most of us have lost our proper thirst reflex by the end of our childhood?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;or that&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Bottled and tap waters contain many impurities like heavy metals and inorganic minerals that are likely to have an adverse effect on your health &lt;/blockquote&gt;So no shortage of bullshit to keep you entertained. Their purification system is definately a first in &lt;a href="http://www.pureh2o.co.uk/healthFunctions.php"&gt;chemical synthesis&lt;/a&gt; though:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Water filtered using our patented system removes all the chemicals and impurities, both organics and inorganics, to provide you with &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;one hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; (my bold)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh. I assumed they were selling water rather than HO2, who'd have thunk? As if all the sillyness wasn't enough we get:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The fifth function [of water] - that of an electronegative enhancer (something which increases the negativity of red blood cells thereby maintaining the optimum distance between each cell and could therefore reduce the risk of clotting) - was first documented by renowned chemist Thomas Riddick over 100 years ago. Subsequent studies confirm that when water was consumed in its purest form, i.e. Pure H2O, it has remarkable and unique health benefits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say there's no pointer to the studies (and I reckon no point in discussing further).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all know there are dangers with drinking too much water - Nutritional Therapist Barbara Nash &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/jul/23/health"&gt;settled out of court&lt;/a&gt; with the family of Dawn Page who had suffered brain damage following Nash's &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/07/blame-everyone-but-yourselves/"&gt;"Amazing Hydration Diet"&lt;/a&gt;. (Of course the media ran this story, seemingly blissfully unaware of how their own repeated pumping  of uncritical fawning towards similar 'miracle cures' had in some part lead to the situation arising). Nash was an Alumnus of the &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/11/be-aware-of-who-you-believe-and-what.html"&gt;College of Natural Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; - avid TiD readers will remember Nash's teacher, Barbara Wren happily telling people that a urine press placed on the neck will combat thyoid cancer. She also had plenty to say about &lt;a href="http://www.futurevisions.org/cnn_water_dehydr.htm"&gt;her own fetish&lt;/a&gt; for pure water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how can a company like PureH20 (or is it HO2?) manage to write such drivel without a challenge? Well, some rebuff came today in the form of an Advertising Standards Authority ruling from a magazine advert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are a few of the claims which were 'questioned':&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Clinically proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and blood pressure...Help prevent &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;cancer&lt;/span&gt; by acting as an antioxidant...reduce stress levels...Reduce your body pollutants and can help reduce urinary infections ... Help prevent, ulcers, IBS and constipation&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;Now of course, not *all* water does this, that would be silly, only PureH2O's special water does this. (Although it's not the first time the &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/08/how-long-does-silly-season-last_13.html"&gt;ASA slapped down&lt;/a&gt; a company for claiming water could lower cholesterol)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, let me just reiterate what they saying: Water - good against cancer, cholesterol, blood pressure, stress, and others. I'll put it to you there isn't a person with any of these problems who *isn't* taking water. And if they aren't, their disease profile is irrelevant, as they'll die of thirst.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about if I want to drink mineral water - have you any advice or fear for me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Water can be bad for you ... Every time you drink mineral water, a high level of minerals, such as calcium, are deposited in your body.  Every time you drink a glass of tap water, you're digesting contaminants such as salts, minerals, metals, pesticides, microbes, hormones and parasites ... Your body becomes toxically overloaded ... Over time, this build up can contribute to chronic kidney disease, heart failure or skeletal fluorosis...a toxic cocktail&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toxic cocktail, eh? Mineral water? They're really spreading the stupid on thick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Pure H2O Co. said the claims were supported by a thesis on Pure H2O for the British Institute of Homeopathy and Westbrook University, USA, carried out as a PhD by Dr Purkait from the University of Surrey. I suppose if anyone knows about pure uncontaminated water, a homeopath would. Sensibly, the ASA noted:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[the claims were] from a manufacturer of a water purification system whose promotional literature also appeared in the thesis, and considered it was therefore not sufficiently impartial&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cheap hucksterism and nothing more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As usual the ASA has done a sterling job of smacking down the quacks. As always, my irk is that they have no power and little influence but to continue playing whack-a-mole (whack-a-quack?) with the snakeoil sellers. Not quite selling snow to eskimos, but water to idiots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-7641450237189070928?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235594798906"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4071">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9759bd321932066c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Education"/><category term="incentives"/><category term="luck"/><category term="Malcolm Gladwell"/><category term="Robert Frank"/><title type="html">"This Is No Picnic for Me Either, Buster": Obama and Outliers</title><published>2009-02-25T19:45:41Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T19:45:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/3poCJhT582U/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/this-is-no-picnic-for-me-either-buster-obama-and-outliers/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">My favorite Obama quotation is not one of his most poetic:

In the latest eskeptic email he critically reviews the Movie &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Greatest Story Ever Garbled &lt;br&gt;by Tim Callahan &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the worst aspect of “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” Part I of Peter Joseph’s Internet film, &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt;, is that some of what it asserts is true. Unfortunately, this material is liberally — and sloppily — mixed with material that is only partially true and much that is plainly and simply bogus. Joseph’s main argument is that Jesus never existed and is in fact a mythical character based on earlier sun gods. He sees all the motifs and characters of the New Testament as coded astrological or solar references. The argument that Jesus was a mythical construct has been made before — for example by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy in their 1999 book, &lt;em&gt;The Jesus Mysteries&lt;/em&gt;, though Freke and Gandy made their argument with a far greater level of scholarship. In reducing Jesus to a sun god, Joseph ignores — as Freke and Gandy did before him — the powerful current of messianic apocalypticism prevalent in first century Judea. The fact that there were references back to earlier dying and rising gods in the Christ myth can lend an air of spurious scholarship to &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt;, as long as one ignores the equally important messianic myth and the fact that there is a viable basis for an actual historical Jesus. Joseph totally ignores the messianic/apocalyptic aspects of the New Testament writings and erroneously asserts that there is no evidence for a historical Jesus. I will return to this issue later. For now, let us consider Joseph’s solar deity argument. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Solar Cross &amp;amp; Sloppy Solar Symbolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first assertion made in &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;is that the cross is a solar symbol and not a representation of the instrument of Jesus’ execution. That’s true enough, as far as it goes, which isn’t very far. What Jesus was crucified on probably looked more like a capital “T,” the crossbeam to which Jesus’ wrists were nailed being hoisted to rest atop an already anchored upright post. It was then probably secured in place by a spike. The Christian cross probably represents a melding of this “T” shape with the solar cross as a bit of religious syncretism. This can be seen if one considers that many Christian crosses are shown enclosed by or intersecting a circle, as in the Celtic cross. The cross is also a symbol of the four cardinal directions and the four winds. However, the solar associations of the cross, while adding solar connotations to the Christ myth, do not militate against it also being a symbol of the Crucifixion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph next asserts that the gods Horus, Krishna, Mithra and Attys all paralleled Jesus. Again, there is some truth to this, but Joseph mingles so much falsehood with whatever truths he reveals as to give ample ammunition to evangelical Christians who might want to shoot holes in his thesis. First of all, he says that the Egyptian god Horus was adored by three kings, had twelve disciples and was crucified. He says much the same thing about Mithra, as well as noting that Krishna was born on December 25. Almost none of this is true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to Egyptian sources of the Christ myth, Joseph seems to have conflated Horus with his father, Osiris. The Osiris/Horus myth, in much simplified terms, goes as follows: Set, the evil brother of the good Osiris, murders that god and cuts his body into 14 pieces. Isis, the wife of Osiris collects and reassembles the pieces, having to substitute a wooden phallus for that part of the dead god’s anatomy. She copulates with the dead god in the form of a bird, conceives Horus and gives birth to him in secret, raising him on an island in the Nile amidst the reeds. She also raises Osiris from the dead, although this very physical resurrection is in the underworld. When Horus comes of age he does battle with his uncle Set. Set tears out the eye of Horus, while Horus rips off Set’s genitals. Eventually, peace is made between the two, both are healed, and they divide the rule of the year by seasons of life and death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The physical resurrection of Osiris, even though it is in the underworld, is a significant precursor to Jesus as a dying and rising god, as is the physical resurrection of Dionysus, after he is killed, dismembered and partially eaten by the Titans. Surprisingly, Joseph fails to mention this bit of classical mythology. Horus being born and nursed in the rushes of an island in the Nile is an important parallel to the infant Moses being found among the rushes. However, beyond the resurrection of Osiris, the main parallels between the Egyptian myth and the New Testament are iconic. Isis with the dead body of Osiris prefigures the imagery of the Pieta. More importantly, Christians co-opted the imagery of Isis and the infant Horus in the form of the Madonna and child. I have absolutely no idea where Joseph got the notion that Horus had 12 disciples or that he was ever crucified. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the god who is born on December 25 — this was not Krishna, but Mithra in his solar aspect as &lt;em&gt;Sol Invictus &lt;/em&gt;(Latin for “Unconquered Sun”). The reason Mithra/Sol Invictus was born on December 25 was that in the Roman calendar of that day, that was the Winter Solstice, the 24-hour period having the fewest number of daylight hours. From that date the days get longer and the nights get shorter until the Summer Solstice. Owing to imperfections in the Roman or Julian calendar, the solstice gradually shifted to December 21, until corrections were made resulting in our present Gregorian calendar. Christianity seems to have deliberately co-opted the birthday of Mithra as a way of occupying a rival’s holiday, rather than this being the result of Jesus being a solar savior. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph’s confusion continues when he tries to tie Isis into the Annunciation narrative of Luke. He says that an Annunciation scene from Luxor shows Isis being told by angelic beings she will bear Horus. Actually, the panels from Luxor depict the mother of Hatshepsut being told she will bear the divine child. Next, the god Amon-Ra consorts with Hatshepsut’s mother. Then the divine child (Hatshepsut) is adored by gods and mortals. This is probably the source of Luke’s Nativity. Mary is told by the angel Gabriel she will bear the divine child. The Holy Spirit overshadows her. Then angels and mortals (shepherds) adore Jesus. However, it has nothing to do with Isis. It was part of the standard Egyptian royal myth that each Pharaoh was engendered by Amon Ra, taking his father’s mortal form to have sexual relations with the Pharaoh’s mother. The reason Hatshepsut (ruled 1498–1483 BCE) had to emphasize her divine origins is that, as a female, she was assumed to have ordinary mortal origins. So there probably is an Egyptian origin to the Lucan Nativity, but it has nothing to do with Isis, Osiris or Horus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Kings &amp;amp; Other Astrological Nonsense&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;continues to find not only solar but astrological sources for the Christ myth. The star followed by the wise men is Sirius, in the constellation Canis Major, which lines up with three bright stars on Orion’s belt. These stars are often called the “three kings,” hence the three kings following the star in the Nativity story. Mary is a virgin because she represents the constellation Virgo, which is also referred to as the “House of Bread,” or, in Hebrew beth-lehem, or the town of Bethlehem, The death of Jesus by crucifixion represents the sun being in the Southern Cross, a constellation that in antiquity was visible from the Mediterranean. Thus, the sun was, at its lowest point in the sky (when it “died”) “crucified,” in that it was ensnared in the Southern Cross. Jesus rose from the dead at Easter because it was then, at the Vernal Equinox, that the sun conquered darkness. Jesus had 12 disciples because they represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac. His crown of thorns at the Crucifixion represents the rays of the sun emanating from his head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story, like most of Part I of &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt;, is a pastiche of factoid, fiction and ingenious invention. It also betrays a certain naïveté on the part of Peter Joseph in regard to his knowledge of the Bible. This is obvious when he sees in the “Three Kings” of Orion’s belt pointing at Sirius, the source of the magi following the star in the Nativity story of Matthew. At this point, let me ask readers a question: Without looking at a Bible, tell me how many wise men or kings followed the star to Bethlehem. Most likely you answered “Three.” After all, we’ve all heard and sung the popular Christmas carol “We Three Kings of Orient Are.” So weren’t there three kings? Let’s look at the Bible, specifically at Matthew 2:1,2:&lt;blockquote&gt;Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;Two things are readily apparent from this passage. First, those who saw the star are wise men, not kings. In the original Greek of the New Testament, what is translated as “wise men” is magi, that is, Zoroastrian holy men. The Greek word magos is the source of our words mage, magic and magician. Second, Matthew nowhere says how many magi came to Jerusalem. So where did we ever get the idea there were three of them? Also, if they were actually following a star, it would have led them directly to Bethlehem. The star doesn’t actually lead the magi until they have been told by Herod’s scribes to go to Bethlehem. Only then does the following happen (Mt. 2:9–11):&lt;blockquote&gt;When they had heard the king they went on their way, and lo, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy; and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then, opening their treasures they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This is odd. One wonders why the star didn’t just lead the magi to Bethlehem right off. This has led many to speculate that the “star” wasn’t an actual star, but perhaps a conjunction of astrologically significant planets in one constellation or another. It would be tedious to go into them here. Suffice it to say that Joseph’s “three kings” in the belt of Orion bear no relation to the actual myth in Matthew’s account of the Nativity. The only reason conventions of art and caroling gave us three wise men (not kings) is that the magi give Jesus three gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is in these three gifts, along with the eastern origin of the &lt;em&gt;magi&lt;/em&gt;, that we see the key to the actual myth in Matthew’s Nativity, which is political. Throughout the Mathean Nativity account, the gospel’s author takes great pains to find fulfilled prophecies showing Jesus to be the messiah of the Davidic line of kings. He is born in Bethlehem because that was David’s home town, and Jesus must be born there to fulfill the prophecy in Micah 5:2, which the chief priests and scribes quote to Herod when the magi ask where the baby is that is born to be king of the Jews (Mt. 2:5, 6):&lt;blockquote&gt;They [the priests and scribes] told him [Herod], “In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, &lt;br&gt;are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah; &lt;br&gt;for from you will come a ruler &lt;br&gt;who will govern my people Israel’” &lt;/blockquote&gt;So Bethlehem’s mythic associations have to do with Davidic kingship, not astrology. The three gifts also reflect Davidic kingship, since the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon rich and kingly gifts (1 Kings 10:10). These included a great quantity of gold and, by implication, since Sheba, or Saba was located in modern Yemen, at the southern end of the Red Sea, frankincense and myrrh. Sheba, or Saba, in Yemen is at the southern end, the point of origin of an ancient caravan route that stretched from Yemen to Damascus called the “Incense Route,” since what was traded from the southern end of the Red Sea were two forms of incense, frankincense and myrrh. Thus, the infant Jesus received from the magi the same gifts given to Solomon by the Queen of Sheba. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other astrological fantasies in &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;regarding the Christ myth are that Mary is a virgin because she personifies the constellation Virgo, that the Crucifixion represents the sun in the constellation of the Southern Cross, that Easter is related to the sun’s triumph over darkness at or shortly following the Vernal Equinox, that Jesus’ 12 disciples represent the signs of the Zodiac, and that his crown of thorns represents solar rays emanating from his head. The astrological associations of all of these elements are tenuous at best. Certainly, the virgin birth and the elevation of the Virgin Mary in the Gospel of Luke reflects pagan influences on the Christ myth, which can be seen in the Lucan Nativity and which sharply contrast to the messianic/Davidic kingship motifs of Matthew. As previously noted. Luke’s Nativity seems to be based on Egyptian panels from Luxor dating to the 18th dynasty and the reign of Queen Hatshepsut. So Mary could relate to the constellation Virgo, but also took on the iconography of Isis &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the sighting of Easter near the time of the Vernal Equinox, we must remember that the Passion is staged during Passover. There is a complex layering here that is lost if we simply relegate Easter to a celebration of the Vernal Equinox. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christ myth relates not only to previous dying and rising gods, like Osiris and Dionysus, but as well to Jewish messianic, apocalyptic and historical myths. Thus, situating Easter in the Passover season probably relates more to messianic myth than to the sun. Passover itself was probably originally a festival of first fruits, that is, a seasonal, agricultural festival relating to rebirth. However, Jewish seasonal festivals relating to a cyclic view of time were recast in messianic, apocalyptic terms as historical and related to a linear concept of time. In the case of Jewish belief, I believe it’s safe to say that the linear, historical view effectively eclipsed the original seasonal festival. Since the Christian Passion and Resurrection narratives reintroduce a dying and rising god meme into the holiday, the layering of Easter becomes far more complex. Easter blends apocalyptic messianism, emphasizing Christ’s death and resurrection as the critical turning point in God’s war with Satan, and portraying Jesus as the culmination of Israel’s hopes and dreams, with the dying and rising god motif, and the promise to Christians that they, too, would transcend death. It must also be remembered that the cult of Isis and Osiris, which spread through the Roman Empire about a century before the time of Jesus, was not entirely the same as the millennia old Egyptian fertility cult it had originally been. Rather, it was, in all probability, Hellenized and showed some of the refinements of Greek philosophy. This was, likewise, probably the case with the much younger cult of Dionysus, another dying and rising god. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus having 12 disciples also relates more to Jewish messianism than to astrology. The 12 disciples relate to the 12 tribes of Israel, which, though they no longer existed as political entities, were important genealogically to the extent that Paul could confidently claim to be of the tribe of Benjamin (Romans 11:1). Actually, there were 13 tribes, 12 plus the priestly tribe of Levites. Each tribe originally supported the Levitical priesthood and maintained the central shrine for one month a year. The division of the tribes worshipping Yahweh into 12 divisions may well reflect influences of what was originally a lunar cult, but such influences had been subsumed by the apocalyptic, messianic monotheism of post-exilic Judaism well before the time of Christ. Had the 12 disciples represented the signs of the Zodiac, as Joseph asserts, then we would expect to find the disciples individually given specific zodiacal characteristics in the canonical gospels. Instead, most of the disciples are little more than names and lack any character whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus’ crown of thorns, along with most of the specific details of the Passion — his being clothed in a purple robe and given a reed as a scepter, the mocking and scourging by the Roman troops, even his being put to death — were probably elements of the Zagmuku Festival, which the Jews brought back with them from Babylon after their captivity there (587–538 BCE). Elements of this festival are to be found in the entirely fictional Book of Esther and the celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. This, by the way, is not to say that Jesus’ crucifixion was not a real, historical event, merely that its details were heavily fictionalized in the process of dramatization and storytelling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the historiscity of Jesus that will tell us whether the Crucifixion was real or merely symbolic of the sun descending into the constellation of the Southern Cross. I will deal with that subject later. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of the Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;continues its assertion of the astrological basis of Christianity and even of the Jewish Scriptures with the assertion that both Moses and Jesus based their words and actions on a belief in astrological ages of roughly 2,000 plus years dominated by a specific sign of the Zodiac. According to this scheme the Age of Taurus (the Bull) was ending or had ended when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt and was being superceded by the Age of Aries (the Ram). This age was, in turn, superceded by the Age of Pisces, in which we live, but which is now winding down. It will soon be followed by the Age of Aquarius, hence the song by the same name from the musical &lt;em&gt;Hair&lt;/em&gt;. Moses, Peter Joseph says, condemned worshipping the golden bull calf because it was a throwback to an earlier age. The blowing of the &lt;em&gt;shofar&lt;/em&gt;, specifically a ram’s horn, and other symbols indicate that Judaism came, initially, out of the Age of Aries. Since Christianity came into being at the beginning of the Age of Pisces, fish symbolism is particularly common in the New Testament. Thus Jesus tells the fishermen he recruits (Mark 1:17), “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” Thus he feeds the multitude with loaves and fishes, and thus the fish is a Christian symbol. There are also, according to Joseph, references in the Christian Scriptures to the coming Aquarian Age. Jesus tells his disciples to follow a man bearing a jar of water (i.e. Aquarius, the water bearer) in Luke 22:10:&lt;blockquote&gt;He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters, and tell the householder, ‘The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room, where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’"&lt;/blockquote&gt;Finally, Jesus tells his disciples (Mt. 28:20) referring to the Age of Pisces and its transition into the Age of Aquarius, “I am with you always, to the end of the age.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, was the fish imagery in the New Testament a reference to the Age of Pisces? When Jesus spoke of the “end of the age,” was he referring to the transition from the Piscean to Aquarian age some 2,000 plus years into the future? The answer to all these questions is, “No.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consider the antagonism against bull imagery implicit in Moses condemning the people’s worship of the golden calf. This Yahwistic prejudice seems to have evaporated by that time of the building of Solomon’s Temple, as can be seen in this description of the “molten sea,” a huge vessel containing water that was one of the principle furnishings of the Temple (1 Kings 7:25): “It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing nth, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.” Oxen also decorate the panels of ten stands made of bronze, along with lions and cherubim (1 Kings. 7:28). Yet, for all the rich imagery of the interior of Solomon’s Temple, it is utterly devoid of any image of rams. Thus, we must assume that the story of the golden calf in Exodus refers, as it would seem, to idolatry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fish certainly are common images in the New Testament. Yet so are olive trees, fig trees, sheaves of grain, and, particularly, sheep and lambs. In fact, lambs and lost sheep probably figure more prominently in the New Testament than do fish. Does this mean that Jesus actually wanted to turn the clock back to the previous Age of Aries? Joseph would probably counter such an objection by pointing to the Christian fish symbol. Doesn’t this point to Christianity as the faith of the Piscean Age? The Christian fish symbol has been interpreted as referring back to the “fishers of men” phrase from Mark 1:17 and has also been seen as a vaginal symbol lying on its side. However, it appears most likely that the Greek word for fish, ichthys, was an acronym for (in Greek) &lt;em&gt;Iasos Christos Theos Yios Soter&lt;/em&gt;, or “Jesus Christ, son of God, savior.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The assertion in &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;that when Jesus tells his disciples in Mt. 28:20 he will be with them until the end of the age, he is referring to a time roughly 2,000 years into the future is absurd considering the apocalyptic outlook of early Christianity. Consider what Jesus has to say in Mark 8: 38–9:1:&lt;blockquote&gt;“For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” And he said to them, “Truly I ay to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.” &lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite the efforts of Christian apologists to rationalize this as something other than a prediction of the end of the world in Jesus’ own generation, there is little else to which it could refer. The parallel verses in Matthew even throw in the Last Judgment (Mt. 16: 27, 28):&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay every man for what he has done. Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not tastes death before they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Though there are no parallel verses to this in the Gospel of John, it also proclaims the imminent end of the world (John. 5: 28, 29):&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his [Jesus’] voice and come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Paul also proclaimed the end of the world in his generation in this passage from 1 Thessalonians (1 Thess. 4: 15-17):&lt;blockquote&gt;For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we, who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, shall not precede those who have fallen asleep [i.e. died]. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the archangel’s call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God And the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord. &lt;/blockquote&gt;These are but a few of the apocalyptic references salted throughout the New Testament. However, lest anyone doubt that early Christians believed the world would end in their generation, consider what John of Patmos says at the opening of Revelation, that vivid and detailed description of the end of days (Rev. 1:1, 2, emphasis added):&lt;blockquote&gt;The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants what must soon take place; and he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. &lt;/blockquote&gt;“What must soon take place’” cannot refer to the end of the Piscean Age some 2,000 years into the future any more than it can refer to a series of events triggered by Russia invading Israel in 1988. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;History vs. Myth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again mixing facts with sloppy assumptions, Part I of &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;concludes with an assault on the historicity of Jesus, claming that, outside the New Testament, there is no indication that Jesus ever existed. Joseph correctly points out that the biblical flood myth has its origins in material antedating the earliest sources of the Hebrew Scriptures. He specifically cites the Epic of Gilgamesh. However, he could just as well have cited the Sumerian flood hero Zuisudra, whose account greatly antedates the flood account in Gilgamesh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was there a real Jesus? While the historical evidence is meager, it does exist. In his &lt;em&gt;Antiquities of the Jews&lt;/em&gt;, book 20, chapter 9, item 1, referring to the execution of James, Josephus refers to him as the brother of “Jesus, who was called the Christ.” It is quite plain that Josephus didn’t see Jesus as the Christ (&lt;em&gt;Christos&lt;/em&gt;, the Greek word meaning “anointed”), he merely recorded that James’ brother was the Jesus who had been called or was alleged to be the Christ. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond this scrap, valuable though it is, we can imply the existence of a historical Jesus from the criteria of embarrassment and difficulty. The criterion of embarrassment says that people do not make up embarrassing details about someone they wish to revere. So, if they say such things about the person, they are probably true. Now let’s apply this to what the Roman historian Tacitus had to say about Jesus early in the second century. Concerning rumors that had spread that Nero had deliberately set fire to the city of Rome, Tacitus says (&lt;em&gt;The Annals of Imperial Rome&lt;/em&gt;, Book 1, Chapter 15): &lt;blockquote&gt;To suppress this rumor, Nero fabricated scapegoats — and punished with every refinement the notoriously depraved Christians (as they were called). Their originator, Christ, had been executed in Tiberius’ reign by the governor of Judea, Pontius Pilatus. But in spite of this temporary setback the deadly superstition had broken out afresh, not only in Judea (where the mischief had started) but even in Rome. All degraded and shameful practices collect and flourish in the capitol. &lt;/blockquote&gt;That Tacitus is obviously a hostile witness makes it much more likely that he accepted Jesus as a real person. Had he reason to suspect he was nothing more than a fabrication, Tacitus would certainly have said so. That author’s claim that Jesus had been executed by Pontius Pilate could only have come from one of two possible sources: Either Tacitus knew this to be true from extant imperial records or he was repeating what Christians themselves had said of Jesus. Were Jesus a mythical character they had invented, they certainly wouldn’t have gone out of their way to invent his being a criminal who had been executed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In like manner, people do not go out of their way to invent difficulties for a character they have invented. It is clear from the Nativity narratives of the gospels of Matthew and Luke that they were faced with having to explain why Jesus grew up in Galilee if he was born in Bethlehem. Both gospels had to invent rather convoluted means to get Jesus born in Bethlehem in accordance with the messianic prophecy in Micah 5:2, then get him moved to Nazareth. Clearly they were stuck with a real person known to have come from Galilee, when he should have come from Bethlehem. Had they been making Jesus up out of whole cloth, they would simply have said he came from Bethlehem: end of story, no complications. So the evidence for Jesus as a real, historical personage, though meager, is solid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Roman Plot?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering that Part II of &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;asserts that the destruction of the World Trade Center was a conspiracy on the part of the powers that be, and that Part III is an attack on the Federal Reserve Board and income tax as unconstitutional plots devised by hidden powers bent on reducing all of us to poverty, one might wonder why Peter Joseph even bothered to open his film with an attack on Jesus and Christianity. Summing up at the end of Part I, Joseph asserts that Christianity was, in fact, developed by the Romans as a means of social control. He cites the Council of Nicaea in 325 as the beginning of this social control. So this is the connection between Part I and the rest of the film: Everything you’ve ever believed to be true is all a pack of lies foisted on you by the secret manipulators who really run things. They faked the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon to manipulate us into a war. They are undermining our financial and other freedoms through manipulation of our money and — guess what?! — they’ve been at it since the creation of Christianity, back in the time of the Roman Empire! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist &lt;/em&gt;is The Da Vinci Code on steroids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/#feature"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I'm highly skilled at the first item.  As long people are accommodating of my communication style, I'm not too shabby at the second item either.  The third item however can be a big problem because it involves barriers set by people, agencies, and bureaucracy.  These barriers can be especially difficult to surmount when the people or agencies have the power to revoke services necessary for survival or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into too much personal detail that will likely get me into even deeper trouble, I've been trying to get some needs met with one of my service providers.  My requests have generated quite a lot of resistance on the part of the provider, despite being (if one is actually reading what I'm asking for not some imaginary thing I didn't write) within the range of services available to me.  This agency currently provides me with some essential components of my long term survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today as my stress levels are peaking far into the danger zone and I'm on the edge of utter panic about still not getting these needs met, I'm simultaneously thinking, don't say another word, not another email, shhhhh, the agency is already pissed for hearing this needs request too many times, don't make anything worse, step back, be cautious, do not "&lt;a href="http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/rock+the+boat.html"&gt;rock the boat&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually someone following the situation pointed out very plainly what was going on, "Stop being scared of the agency; it works for you not the other way around."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I of course responded with an extra dose of panic, "But if I mess up at all and make them any more angry, if I misstep, they will drop me from the program and then--"  Panic, oh yes.  Panic for the past 24 hours.  Keeping-me-awake-at-night panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the thing.  I'm afraid to stand up for my rights and my needs because I'm afraid that the people with the power will deny me access to things I need.  This sort of power imbalance is a way that, often unintentionally, social service systems themselves disempower and silence self-advocates.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all probably know what a brat I am by now and how fierce I am about control over my own life.  But even I can be brought to cowering and cow-towing to The Powers That Be when I feel like my quality of life is being threatened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm feeling a little better after much crisis management and some deeper thinking.  I've come to terms with the reality of the risk and have a "plan B" for what to do in the event that my provider did drop me.  In this particular situation, I do have options.  I'm a little ashamed that I let the provider have that much power over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But truly, me feeling better is not the point.  The point is that fear of loss of services is a huge (possibly deadly) barrier to the empowerment of self-advocates.  Not convinced on the possibly deadly?  Recall the recent &lt;a href="http://notdeadyetnewscommentary.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-on-minna-mettinen-kekalainen-home.html"&gt;situation with Minna Mettinen-Kekalainen&lt;/a&gt;.

Weiss wrote an op-ed which was basically a baseless argument that these uppity New Atheists should sit down and shut up because Charles Darwin  &amp;quot;knew there is plenty of room for God at the top&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s a stupid argument on many levels, and not just because we are none of us worshippers of Darwinian infallibility…but also because it misrepresents Darwin&amp;#39;s ideas about religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiss and Nisbet are trying to use Darwin as a positive example to contrast with their presumed negative example of the New Atheists. If they did this with regard to the public expression and aggressive style of the New Atheists, especially in their intolerance of all religions, they would have a good argument. Darwin and most atheists today are much more circumspect than the New Atheists and not so intolerant of all religions and religious philosophies. But instead, they criticized the New Atheists with the actual philosophical atheistic beliefs themselves, and here their argument fails, since Darwin was no different in this regard than Dawkins, Hitchens, Dennett, et al. By the end of his life, Darwin was a total agnostic, nontheist, and--concerning the Christian God--antitheist. When Darwin wrote, "The safest conclusion seems to be that the whole subject [the existence of an ineffable god] is beyond the scope of man's intellect," he was correct about generic gods in general, and I don't think the New Atheists would disagree. Both they and Darwin would be nontheistic about generic gods. "Every man," Darwin wrote, "must judge for himself, between conflicting vague probabilities." For the most part this is obvious, and Darwin had judged for himself and chosen agnosticism and atheism--nontheism for god and antitheism for the Christian God (whose existence he thought had been disproved by the problem of evil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/as_long_as_im_abusing_framers.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/BKL1av-_UxQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235583386309"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/republican-party-still-shilling-antiscience/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ed5aa2898e0feaa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Republican party *still* shilling antiscience?</title><published>2009-02-25T17:33:06Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T17:33:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/republican-party-still-shilling-antiscience/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember that day in November, that day when the Republican party was handed their head on a platter by the voting public. Now, a lot of people would have taken that as a lesson, perhaps realizing that something is wrong if so many people voted against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the Republican party leaders are not in that group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobby Jindal gave the Republican &amp;quot;rebuttal&amp;quot; to the President’s speech yesterday. Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Bobby Jindal: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/12/who-will-exorcise-mccains-choice-for-vp/"&gt;amateur exorcist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/14/jindal-dooms-louisiana/"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/12/louisiana-epically-doomed/"&gt;doomer-of-Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. He is obviously making a run for 2012, though how well advised that is might be up for vote. Perhaps literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last night, in an attempt to make a sound bite, he bit himself instead &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhekpgTNZ0Y"&gt;with this line&lt;/a&gt; about the stimulus package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/bhekpgTNZ0Y%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the transcript of what he said (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the projects in the bill make sense, &lt;strong&gt;their legislation is larded with wasteful spending&lt;/strong&gt;. It includes $300 million to buy new cars for the government, $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, such as a magnetic levitation line from Las Vegas to Disneyland, &lt;strong&gt;and $140 million for something called volcano monitoring. Instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington, D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you freaking &lt;em&gt;kidding&lt;/em&gt; me? Are these guys still trying to score points by being blatantly antiscience? I bet there are a few million folks in Seattle, Oregon, northern California, Alaska, and, y’know, &lt;em&gt;Hawaii&lt;/em&gt; that think volcano monitoring is a fine and dandy idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_Caldera"&gt;Yellowstone&lt;/a&gt;, potentially the scariest place on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck is it with these guys? I don’t mean Republicans in general, I mean the ones running the party. Do they not get what’s really important, and what’s just rhetorical partisan garbage? I hope that this line by Jindal becomes his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/10/sarah_palin_ignorant_and_antis.php"&gt;fruit fly&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/16/repost-mccains-planetariophobia/"&gt;planetarium-as-overhead-projector&lt;/a&gt;. Because when people in charge say things so mind-numbingly dumb, it is our duty to make sure everyone knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana, I’m sorry your governor is such an antiscience ignorant blowhard. But please don’t try to foist him on the rest of the country in three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update (12:15 Mountain time): A lot of commenters are asking why this sort of funding is in the stimulus bill in the first place,and call it pork. They’re missing the point: the point of the stimulus bill is to stimulate the economy, both in the short and the long term. Funding science does exactly that; it helps pay for scientists, experiments, equipment, and more. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/06/this-package-is-unstimulated/"&gt;I have written about this before&lt;/a&gt;.

It's shocking! But then I knew all along that he was smarter than his flirtation with the abhorrent insanity of Nisbetian framing would suggest. He has an &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/02/the-george-will-scandal/"&gt;article summarizing the George Will nonsense&lt;/a&gt; — where &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/19/the-sea-ice-affair-continued/"&gt;Will promoted outright falsehoods&lt;/a&gt; in support of his global warming denialism — and Mooney states something in his summary that I agree with entirely. Well, almost entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, I view the George Will affair with sadness. Sure, I share in the temporary glee of the bloggers. But at the same time, I know there are many kinds of journalism, particularly about science, that bloggers will never replace. They're extremely well-equipped to pounce and skewer a George Will column, but hardly well equipped to deliver an investigative or narrative feature story. We're watching the media change before our eyes, the science media in particular--and no one can say, in light of episodes like the latest one involving George Will, that much of old media doesn't in some sense "deserve" what's happening to it now. Yet if our only sentiment is joy over the bloggers' latest trophy, or outrage at the Post, we're missing something deep indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do think that there are many bloggers who can and do deliver good narratives, I think it is fair to say that his larger point is correct: there is an ecosystem of the media, and we each have our niches; blogging is not and should not be the sine qua non of information delivery, and newspapers (and TV and radio and podcasts and magazines and …) have their role to play. The lesson of the George Will episode — and of the last dozen years of politics — is that the news has failed because it hasn&amp;#39;t fulfilled that role. Newspapers are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to have more rigor and stricter fact-checking than blogs; they are &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to bravely dig deeper than the average citizen into the major issues of the day. They don't. There certainly is no glee in that sad fact, but I think some joy is deserved that somehow and somewhere the failure of the news media is finally getting some exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's hope that someday that means clowns like George Will can get fired for incompetence, and that newspapers like the Washington Post will make changes to enforce accountability. It doesn't now, of course, which is another reason to temper our happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/chris_mooney_says_something_se.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/K2E78130N9s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235581740629"><id gr:original-id="fKlwSynj3RGeI1v_PhJ3AQ_62bf283643a25ca05595ec6fb0e05676">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4592815db1f6b77e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Suicidal DIY</title><published>2009-02-25T15:48:31Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T15:48:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Sciencepunk/~3/ufjRJd1GQZM/the_suicide_plasterers_-_aphids_that_repair_their_homes_with.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Aphids repair their homes with the bodies of sacrificed soldiers&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Sciencepunk/~4/ufjRJd1GQZM" height="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235580772584"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/kook_fight.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02975057dc1d193e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Kook fight!</title><published>2009-02-25T15:53:14Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T15:53:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/IT4y7l_4a5Y/kook_fight.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/kook_fight.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh, boy! &lt;a href="http://raycomfortfood.blogspot.com/2009/02/catholic-church-and-evolution.html"&gt;Ray Comfort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.speroforum.com/a/18187/The-simple-mind-of-Ray-Comfort"&gt;Bill Donohue&lt;/a&gt; are arguing! The issue is evolution, of course; Comfort says that Christianity and evolution are incompatible, and Donohue is claiming otherwise. They deserve each other, and I don't really care what either of them says, but I have to point out one glaring inconsistency in Donohue's position. Here's what he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comfort is wrong. The fact is that in the 1950s, Pope Pius XII said there was no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of faith, as long as God was not excluded. Pope John Paul II affirmed this teaching in the mid-1990s. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In other words, the Catholic Church teaches that God is the author of all creation. How stages of human development have unfolded is a legitimate area of scientific inquiry, and it has nothing to do with rejecting God as the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nominally true — the Catholic church has been scrupulously vague on the intersection of their religion and the science of evolution. However, Donohue has not. In fact, he has shown considerable contempt for evolutionary theory himself. This past summer, he referred to me as &lt;span&gt;"&lt;a href="http://catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1461"&gt;the Planet-of-the-Apes biologist&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;, and offered an interesting description of the theory of evolution: &lt;span&gt;"&lt;a href="http://catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1460"&gt;the King Kong Theory of Creation&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that means the battle is between a moron and a two-faced lying hypocrite. Fun!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/kook_fight.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/IT4y7l_4a5Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235580654720"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/its-wrong-to-wish-on-space-hardware/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b7548790b3d18196</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Greenhouse gases"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">It’s wrong to wish on space hardware</title><published>2009-02-25T16:19:41Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T16:19:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/02/its-wrong-to-wish-on-space-hardware/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.popsci.com/files/imagecache/article_image_large/files/articles/OCO.jpg" align="right" width="35%"&gt;A number of satellite related issues have come up this weekend: The &lt;a href="http://www-nsidc.colorado.edu/arcticseaicenews/2009/021809.html"&gt;NSIDC&lt;/a&gt; reminded us that satellite sensors are (like all kinds of data) not perfectly reliable and do not last forever.  Two satellites &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/science/space/12satellite.html"&gt;collided&lt;/a&gt; by accident last week, littering the orbit with dangerous amounts of debris. In San Diego this weekend, I was fortunate enough to attend a &lt;a href="http://www.spacefest.info/?u=home.html&amp;amp;title=Spacefest+2009+Home+Page"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; with some of the Apollo astronauts and some of the scientists involved in Cassini and the Mars Phoenix missions. And yesterday morning we heard that the &lt;a href="http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;Orbiting Carbon Observatory&lt;/a&gt; mission launch failed to insert the satellite into orbit, and it is presumably measuring carbon dioxide somewhere at the bottom of the Southern Ocean. Coincidentally, when it came up on the news, I was in a meeting with one of the scientists who had been working on setting up a climate model to assimilate the OCO data in order to pin down the carbon sinks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these events have served to remind me at least, that although the space age is 50 years old, we are a long way from the point where we can take our ability to launch and control off-planet machines for granted. Getting into space was, and remains, a tremendous challenge. This makes the successes we've had all the more incredible, and a testament to the hard work the engineers and scientists do over many years before a launch to give the missions the best chance of success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the climate-related satellites/instruments - SSM/I for the sea ice, OCO for high-precision CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations - there is some redundancy with other existing missions. The JAXA AMSR-E sensor can still be used for sea ice extent (and indeed, SSM/I is still sending enough data back to construct &lt;a href="http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/"&gt;3 day mean&lt;/a&gt; pictures). For CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the substitutes are slightly orthogonal - the Japanese &lt;a href="http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gosat/index_e.html"&gt;Ibuki satellite&lt;/a&gt; launched &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/23/japan-launches-satellite-_n_160413.html"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; will measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but with a very &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2009/0903/full/climate.2009.20.html"&gt;different footprint&lt;/a&gt; than OCO would have used, and the AIRS instrument on Aqua has recently been used to produce a &lt;a href="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a003500/a003562/"&gt;timeseries&lt;/a&gt; of mid-troposphere CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations since 2004. Nonetheless, both of these other missions should provide some of the information that was anticipated from OCO - though not at the spatial resolution envisaged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth discussing a little what OCO was going to be useful for. It &lt;em&gt;wasn't&lt;/em&gt; because we don't know the average amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere and how much it's increasing - that is actually pretty well characterised by the current station network (around 386 ppm growing at ~2ppm/year). However, the variations about the mean (tens of ppm) have a lot of extra information about the carbon cycle that are only coarsely resolved. The measurements would have been from nearer the surface than the AIRS data, and so closer to the sources and sinks. You would have been able to see point sources quite clearly and this would have been a good check on the national inventories of fossil fuel use, and may have been useful at constraining the rather uncertain deforestation contribution to the anthropogenic carbon dioxide sources. More importantly, the OCO data combined with inverse modelling might have helped with constraining the terrestrial sinks. We know they exist from residual calculations (what's left over from knowing how much we are adding, and seeing how much is in the air and what is in the ocean), and they've mainly been associated with boreal ecosystems from the inverse modelling done so far, but there are quite large uncertainties (see 7.3.2 and fig 7.7 in AR4 Chp. 7). The Ibuki and AIRS data will help with this same issue, but OCO data would have been somewhat orthogonal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important consequence perhaps, is that the upcoming &lt;a href="http://glory.giss.nasa.gov/"&gt;Glory mission&lt;/a&gt; may be further delayed since it is slated to use the same launch vehicle as the one that malfunctioned for OCO. Glory has had a troubled past, surviving a number of bouts with near-cancellation, but was basically all set to go in June. This is a big deal because Glory will carry one new instrument (an aerosol polarimeter) that has the unique ability (among sensors flying today) to distinguish between aerosol types in the atmosphere. Currently, aerosol remote sensing can retrieve the total aerosol optical depth, with some ability to discriminate between fine particles and more massive ones, but it can't tell the difference between sea salt and sulphates, dust or soot. This has been a huge problem for aerosol modellers since it is hard to evaluate simulations of each individual aerosol type (and which consequently are &lt;a href="http://dataipsl.ipsl.jussieu.fr/AEROCOM/DATA/SYNTHESIS/AEROCOMA/plots/OD550_AER_an2000_mALLYEAR_WORLD_Fraction.ps.png"&gt;all over the place&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://dataipsl.ipsl.jussieu.fr/cgi-bin/AEROCOM/aerocom/synthesis_annualrs.pl"&gt;AEROCOM&lt;/a&gt;)).  A polarimeter detects the changes in polarisation associated with the aerosols which differs greatly between the different types. The second instrument on Glory is a total irradiance monitor (TIM) which is needed to prevent a gap from forming in the satellite observations of the sun should the current (6 year old) TIM on the &lt;a href="http://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/index.htm"&gt;SORCE satellite&lt;/a&gt; start to falter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, space on satellites is at a huge premium. There are always dozens of possible candidate instruments that could be flown and ensuring that the right mix of monitoring and experimental measurements get made is very hard. For instance, the group behind the polarimeter on Glory were trying to find space on a suitable satellite for years before the Glory mission was resurrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say, that while the OCO failure will be devastating for the teams that worked on the mission, the relatively high chances of a complete failure are part of the price to be paid for working on satellite missions. Fortunately, OCO was a relatively cheap proof-of-concept mission and so it might someday get another day in the sun. &lt;/p&gt;

They have wonderful chemistry, and they were kind enough to allow me to disrupt that chemistry last Sunday with my brash yet gullible American ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already be subscribed to Sundays Supplement on iTunes or whatnot, but just in case you’re not, you can listen &lt;a href="http://www.simondunn.me.uk/files/episode038.mp3"&gt;via this handy mp3 link&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other news! We have a super-awesome &lt;strong&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/strong&gt; quickly approaching: &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=113"&gt;William Lobdell&lt;/a&gt;, journalist and author of &lt;em&gt;Losing My Religion&lt;/em&gt;, will be speaking Monday, March 16. For this event, we’ll be at the &lt;a href="http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/35819632/cambridge_ma/tommy_doyle_s.html"&gt;Tommy Doyle’s in Kendall Square&lt;/a&gt; – not the one in Harvard Square. Don’t go to the wrong place! You will look silly and people will laugh at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you may want to arrive early – &lt;a href="http://www.whatstheharm.net"&gt;Tim Farley&lt;/a&gt;’s talk on Monday was packed with about 80 people, which was tremendous fun but some people had to stand in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m helping some Oklahomies get a regular meet-up going and thus far it’s looking remarkably good. Are you anywhere near Oklahoma City?

&lt;p&gt;Reflections on readers' reactions, bibliometrics and Open Access&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article the author recounts his experiences as editor of &lt;em&gt;Historisk tidskrift&lt;/em&gt;. The starting point is a poll of the journal's readers presented at the triannual meeting of the Swedish Historical Association in Lund in April 2008. Readers told that they read &lt;em&gt;Historisk tidskrift&lt;/em&gt; primarily in order to be up to date on Swedish historical research. The journal reflects fairly well the research interests of Swedish historians. However, concerns for the need to internationalise research and to improve one's qualifications increasingly govern how Swedish historians publish. This affects the attitude to &lt;em&gt;Historisk tidskrift&lt;/em&gt;, which is regarded as too provincial. These and other issues are discussed by the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the article discusses two partly intertwined issues of significance to the journal's future: Bibliometrics and Open Access. The author is sceptical about bibliometric analyses and points to methodological difficulties in applying such measures to the humanities. Nevertheless, &lt;em&gt;Historisk tidskrift&lt;/em&gt; will have to take bibliometrics into account. The author is favourably disposed towards Open Access. However, several problems need to be solved before &lt;em&gt;Historisk tidskrift&lt;/em&gt; can become a full Open Access journal. If the journal loses its subscribers, alternative sources of funds has to be found to pay for editorial work. Before this is done, the present form of publication has to be retained.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.historisktidskrift.se/documents/Jonas_Nordin_Historisk_tidskrift_2008.1_001.pdf"&gt;Full text on-line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/bibliometry_and_open_access_in.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/fCuXzxXznFc" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235575060962"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3437">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4a1b8a32113631a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="charity"/><category term="recession"/><title type="html">Are There Enough Altruists to Profit From?</title><published>2009-02-25T14:44:39Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T14:44:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/2yPP6PWYP9g/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/new-mini-quorum-2/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">While activism is virtually synonymous with "not-for-profit," a San Francisco startup called Virgance has begun a slew of campaigns that aim to make money off of activism.

As good as it's been to dwell on seeing the antivaccine movement suffer &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;two major setbacks in 2009&lt;/a&gt; even before we've reached the end of February, it's time to move on for a while; that is, unless the antivaccine movement does or writes something stupid enough to tempt my attention back. In the meantime, as I get back into the swing of blogging again, I haven't yet gone through my pile of papers that piled up in my absence to find if there is any there that I want to do more serious pieces about. But there are more than one kind of topics other than peer-reviewed papers to blog about that are serious. In fact, some are deadly serious. Some are even related to my area of expertise and make my blood run cold because they are a direct danger to and betrayal of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm talking cancer quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was made aware of a website that promulgates some of the most common (and worst) myths about cancer, coupled with misinformation about cancer and heapin' helpin' of unsupportable claims. It's a book called &lt;a href="http://www.cancer-fighting-strategies.com/offer01.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;11 natural therapies to conquer cancer&lt;/a&gt; by a man named Robert Sopias. Naturally enough for such woo, it starts out with testimonials. I'm going to pick one that's so typical that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/understanding_alternative_medi_1.php"&gt;blogged about similar ones&lt;/a&gt; very early on in the history of this blog. In fact, the reason I mention it is that it's a variation of the one I discussed, one I haven't seen before:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/moving_on_to_cancer_quackery.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/moving_on_to_cancer_quackery.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/hvsIY1aHIsw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235572582767"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/beauty-without-borders/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f9b6198ea05ff2aa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="IYA"/><title type="html">Beauty without borders</title><published>2009-02-25T14:04:57Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T14:04:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/beauty-without-borders/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Right now as I write this, Venus is a brilliant beacon of light in the western sky after sunset. After the Moon, it’s far and away the brightest object in the night sky, obvious to anyone who can see. It’s also the International Year of Astronomy, so a group of people has decided to merge the two events into one called &lt;a href="http://beautywithoutborders.blogspot.com/2009/02/evening-with-venus.html"&gt;Beauty Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;. Starting February 25 (today!) and going through March 1, they want everyone who can to go outside and observe this gorgeous planet. February 28 is the best day, as the crescent Moon will be near Venus, making a beautiful duet in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a great idea. Venus is so bright right now that I’ve received lots of comments on it, from asking me what it is to to people who can’t believe a planet can get so bright! So this is a fantastic opportunity to get people outside and looking up.

So the notion that so-called “brain training” games can help improve mental function and stave off dementia has some appeal to me. It also makes a certain amount of sense - exercise your brain and its function will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, as a skeptic, I have always been bothered by the specific claims made by marketers of games, websites, devices and programs. The formula is probably familiar to you, a specifically designed program is optimized to stimulate brain function, improve integration of information, and improve global function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website promotion for Brain Age, for example, claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows you can prevent muscle loss with exercise, and use such activities to improve your body over time. And the same could be said for your brain. The design of Brain Age is based on the premise that cognitive exercise can improve blood flow to the brain. All it takes is as little as a few minutes of play time a day. For everyone who spends all their play time at the gym working out the major muscle groups, don’t forget - your brain is like a muscle, too. And it craves exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood flow argument is pure hand-waving. The muscle analogy is perhaps more apt than intended - do muscles respond to a specific exercise or to any exercise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the brain the phrase use it or lose it does have some merit, but the notion that specific mental tasks are superior to others for overall brain function has never been compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a new &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19118809?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;review of research published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Peter J. Snyder supports this conclusion. He reviewed 10 randomized controlled trials and found that ordinary (and often free) mental activity, such as social activity or crossword puzzles, is as or more effective than “brain training” games, gimmicks, or programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically he found that the literature is sparse on this issue, but what does exist shows that for healthy adults there is no advantage to specific brain training programs, their benefits are short duration only, and that subjects may improve in the specific task but this does not generalize to overall mental function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly we would benefit from more research in this area, but what evidence we have suggests that you should not waste money on expensive games or programs. But the good news is that you can get the benefits you are looking for by keeping mentally active even in simple ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not addressed by this study, it is also common for companies to specifically claim that their brain-training exercises alter the brain waves. This is just an added layer of pseudoscience used for marketing. Any company that claims they can improve your brain waves is engaging in pure quackery. Some companies even claim to do this passively, just by listening to their tapes, for example. This would actually be counter productive, as it is active participation in any mental activity that seems to be important for improving mental function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market for brain training products this year &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29260646/"&gt;is estimated at $225 million&lt;/a&gt;.  This is not all necessarily waste - many may find Brain Age or other such games to be fun in their own right. Just don’t by the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

Egnor cannot seem to resist when he thinks he has caught someone in an error, and so he throws whatever faint whisper of logic or scholarship he has overboard (hardly noticeable, really) and sinks to new lows of intellectual buffoonery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case he is responding to my discussion of the evolutionary tree of life - the fact that the fossil record and genetic evidence support the conclusion that all life is related through a pattern of branching descent. He refers to my summary of the current consensus of scientific opinion as an “astonishing gaffe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punctuated Equilibrium &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor is using an old creationist trick - the deliberate misinterpretation of legitimate scientific debate about the details of evolution as if it calls into question the fact of evolution itself. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossil record does not show a “clear pattern of branching descent in the fossil record”, even “to the degree that it is complete.” The fossil record shows punctuated equilibrium, which is stasis in a species for millions of years, then disappearance of the species. New species arise, discontinuous with old species. Even isolated ‘transitional’ forms are rare, and gradual transitions are virtually non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see that Egnor does not understand even the most basic evolutionary concepts.  New species that arise in the fossil record are not “discontinuous with old species,” unless he means by that the simple fact that they are recognizably distinct species, which makes the statement rather pointless - new species are new species. New species, rather, are derived from older species - they are morphological variations on existing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, vertebrates first arise in the fossil record in the late Cambrian, about 500 million years ago. Later in the fossil record vertebrate fish with jaws appear. Later still land vertebrates appear, with features of one branch of fish. These early terrestrial vertebrates have some features that all later land vertebrates will share. However, within this group of land vertebrates sub-groups appear over time, each with their own set of features that all of their members will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of analysis looks at homology - features that are shared because they derive from a common ancestor. Homology is distinguished from analogy - features that look similar because of common function, but are different in the details. Homologous traits, on the other hand, share details that cannot be explained by shared function. Looking at life from this perspective we see a clear pattern of branching descent that follows a temporal sequence compatible with evolution from common descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor’s statement that the fossil record does not show branching descent because it shows punctuated equilibrium misunderstands both concepts, the one has nothing to do with the other. Punctuated equilibrium is about what happens between the branching points (speciation events), not about the branching itself. PE states that species will be largely stable, in equilibrium with their environment, for most of their time on earth, but this stasis will be punctuated by relatively rapid (geologically speaking - 5-50 thousand years) speciation events. Darwinian gradualism, on the other hands, states that species are gradually changing throughout their existence. Both views, however, incorporate branching speciation. Both views have the same evolutionary interpretation of the nestled hierarchy of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do not see in the fossil record, however, is true discontinuity - the type that Egnor is talking about which would call evolution into question. We do not see the appearance of species with radically different body plans, or impossible (evolutionarily) chimeras with homologous traits from distinct branches. Nothing that would falsify common descent. If Egnor believes such a creature exists he should name it and claim his Nobel prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tree of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not content to butcher punctuated equilibrium and misinterpret the fossil evidence, Egnor next sets out to completely misrepresent a New Scientist article about the tree of life. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, molecular genetics has refuted Darwin’s “Tree of Life”— as Dr. Novella characterizes it, the “clear pattern of branching descent”— unequivocally. The generally pro-Darwinism magazine New Scientist, in its recent cover story, &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/02/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life.html?full=true"&gt;“Why Darwin Was Wrong About the Tree of Life”&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out that scientists are abandoning the vertical Tree of Life. Molecular biology is showing deep inconsistencies in Darwinists’ simplistic understanding of similarities and differences in biological structure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then gives quotes selected to mislead his readers as to what the article actually says. For example, he give the follow excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…Many biologists now argue that the tree concept is obsolete and needs to be discarded. We have no evidence at all that the tree of life is a reality…[t]hat bombshell has even persuaded some that our fundamental view of biology needs to change…The tree of life is being politely buried, we all know that…What’s less accepted is that our whole fundamental view of biology needs to change. Biology is vastly more complex than we thought…and facing up to this complexity will be as scary as the conceptual upheavals physicists had to take on board in the early 20th century…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware when Egnor uses “…”  - that usually means he is taking quotes out of context and excluding information that would help the reader understand what is actually being written. Read the &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126921.600-why-darwin-was-wrong-about-the-tree-of-life.html?page=1"&gt;full article&lt;/a&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say at first that the New Scientist article went for maximal sensationalism and overstated the case. But even accounting for that, Egnor had to go out of his way to completely miss the bottom line.  From reading Egnor you might think there is recent evidence that calls evolution and common branching descent into question. Again - this is the old creationist trick of distorting progress toward a more complex and complete view of evolution with calling evolution itself into question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is talking about the fact that in recent years scientists have discovered that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is much more common than previously thought. What this means is that species, even after separating, can still transfer genetic material to other species, even distantly related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Egnor does not point out that this is primarily talking about single-celled life. He left that bit out. This is crucial because he offered this as a counter to my contention that the fossil record indicates branching descent. There is no fossil record for branching descent among single-celled creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also not new. We have known for a long time that bacteria swap genes. Yes, it is more extensive than previously thought, but so what. Like most things in science, nature turns out to be more complex than we at first imagine. Simple models need to be made more complex and subtle, but that does not invalidate the more basic knowledge, it just deepens it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we now know about epigenetics - factors other than the DNA that influence development. This does not mean, however, that DNA is not the primary molecule of inheritance. We now know about relativity - this does not mean that Newton’s mechanics are wrong, they are just incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about multicellular life and HGT? Here is a quote from the article Egnor does not want you to see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody is arguing - yet - that the tree concept has outlived its usefulness in animals and plants. While vertical descent is no longer the only game in town, it is still the best way of explaining how multicellular organisms are related to one another - a tree of 51 per cent, maybe. In that respect, Darwin’s vision has triumphed: he knew nothing of micro-organisms and built his theory on the plants and animals he could see around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With multicellular life there is horizontal transfer - closely related species may mate and swap genes, for example. Also, viruses may pick up bits of DNA from one species and transplant them to another phylogenetically distant species.  This is old news. We are likely to discover more horizontal transfer than was previously known. Again - a big so what? Among multicellular life a vertical tree of branching descent is still the dominant pattern we see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the degree to which the tree of life is vertical vs a horizontal web of life is irrelevant to the question at hand - is evolution correct. That there are mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer in no way invalidates the fact of evolution. Nature almost always turns out to be more messy than our clean models of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular biology is showing deep inconsistencies in Darwinists’ simplistic understanding of similarities and differences in biological structure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that the molecular biology he is referring to is being done by scientists who are not “Darwinists”.  If you interpret “Darwinist” as Egnor does - anyone who accepts the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, then this is dead wrong. The only thing that is simplistic is Egnor’s straw man of what evolutionists claim. It is evolutionary biologists who are discovering the rich complexity of life at all levels, and furthering our understand of the the complexities of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to get back to the genetic evidence for branching descent, I have gone over this before. This is a home run for common descent. Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section4.html"&gt;good talkorigins article&lt;/a&gt; on this topic, which states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and chimpanzees have the exact same cytochrome &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; protein sequence. The “null hypothesis” given above is false. In the absence of common descent, the chance of this occurrence is conservatively less than 10&lt;sup&gt;-93&lt;/sup&gt; (1 out of 10&lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, the high degree of similarity in these proteins is a spectacular corroboration of the theory of common descent. Furthermore, human and chimpanzee cytochrome &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; proteins differ by ~10 amino acids from all other mammals. The chance of this occurring in the absence of a hereditary mechanism is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;-29&lt;/sup&gt;. The yeast &lt;em&gt;Candida krusei&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most distantly related eukaryotic organisms from humans. Candida has 51 amino acid differences from the human sequence. A conservative estimate of this probability is less than 10&lt;sup&gt;-25&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor has failed to address this evidence, or even show that he understands it. The dominant pattern within the genetics of various species is one of nestled hierarchies - branching descent. Yes - there are exceptions, which can be explained by horizontal transfer. That is a level of deeper complexity - it does not invalidate the overall evolutionary pattern, which is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is so clear that Darwin’s “Tree of Life” is wrong that now even Darwinists are jumping ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why would Dr. Novella publicly misrepresent the state of the science? Either Dr. Novella’s claim is the result of his ignorance of the relevant science, or it is an intentional misrepresentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Novella should explain his misrepresentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Egnor who has some explaining to do. He has misrepresented my position. He has misunderstood punctuated equilibrium. He has misrepresented the state of the fossil and genetic evidence. And he grossly misrepresented the New Scientist article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor should clarify what he actually believes, rather than just playing the creationist game of exploiting a poor understanding of the complexities of evolutionary theory to create the false impression that the fact of evolution itself is in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor claims he is not a creationist, which is absurd on its face. But he should clarify his position. Does he accept common descent or not.  If not, how does he account for the dominant pattern of branching descent that we do see in the fossil record and the genetic evidence. If he thinks there are problems with evolutionary theory he should make a positive case for a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course he can’t. Egnor cannot win with legitimate scientific arguments, so instead he is trying to make this personal, as if my views are somehow aberrant. Rather, Egnor is at odds with the scientific community. He is perfectly at home with his creationist buddies, whose modus operandi is to distort, misrepresent, and selectively quote. Their purpose is not to enhance understanding but to sow confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

Kyle, Patricia and Jeff Weiss's son, is 7. Alex, Suzy Brenner's son, is in his late teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 11 and several months, my own son is right inbetween the ages of Kyle and Alex. We've been through the early intervention regimens and waded our way through too many treatments and programs and centers and practitioners, and we're now thinking all the time, like Suzy Brenner, about the "great after," after, that is, school is over for our sons. Both the Weisses and Brenner describe their disbelief and devastation after the diagnosis of their children, and also their many efforts to find therapies and help their child. There's mention of the numerous toothbrushes Kyle has sent down the toilet (sounds &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_plumbing_issue"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt;) and of Alex lining up all the family photos (Charlie certainly keeps his photo collection close by, and has been known to lay it all out along the floorboards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the ages of our kids, we are &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_it_together_like_it_or_not"&gt;in it together&lt;/a&gt;. I still feel an immediate bond on catching the glance of another mother whose child has "special needs." There's a lot of difference out there and the sense that one is not walking alone, however much one feels it, is sustaining. One thing's for sure is that there are a lot more options out there than when even my son was younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed: One thing that's definitely changed a lot since Charlie was diagnosed is post-secondary education options for students on the spectrum. Dora recently &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/monday_autism_news_potpourri_3"&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; a document from the Department of Education on &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/print/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html"&gt;Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators&lt;/a&gt;: What I've found interesting about this guide is its intended audience, "high school educators."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide covers a lot, from the admissions process to post-admission and questions of legal rights, and is certainly of interest to students on the spectrum planning to continue their education after high school. It's a also a document that college administrators and staff and faculty (like me) would do well to read, as it outlines the sorts of accommodations that students with disabilities may need (and goes into much more detail beyond the one "accommodation" that I most often hear about from administrators, "more time on tests"). The &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/print/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html"&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; goes into some detail about obtaining services and why documentation is often necessary. It ends by noting that the "key to success" is threefold: attitude, self-advocacy and preparation. Students are encouraged to "understand their disabilities" and to  "take responsibility for their own success."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt; has recently published articles on college for &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2009/02/13/college-is-possible-for-students-with-intellectual-disabilities.html?s_cid=related-links:TOP"&gt;students with intellectual disabilities&lt;/a&gt; and also on college for &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2009/02/24/students-with-learning-disabilities-get-help-with-college.html"&gt;students with learning disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and students on the autism spectrum as well. This latter article highlights a program called &lt;a href="http://www.cleinc.net/"&gt;College Living Experience&lt;/a&gt; (CLE), which is a private program in six cities around the US that operates residential programs to assist students with learning disabilities who are attending college. I've written about CLE &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-college-bound-asd-student-some-special-programs/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/thinking-differently-autistic-life-in-college/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (and some commenters note that they are in the program).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, many more options exist for students on the spectrum to continue their education. For my part, as someone who works in post-secondary education, I'm hopeful that my college and others can learn to better accommodate students on the spectrum. I'm not at all sure about my own son's college prospects. Jim and I are both professors and have a quite good sense of what he'd face; Charlie seems to prefer being out of his desk and doing things, being active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the jury's still out about the college question: As Suzy Brenner says of Alex, "'There are so many milestones that I never thought we'd see when he was 6 or 9 years old'"---things, like talking, which Alex started to do more when he was 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly Charlie's done a quite good job at surprising Jim and me so far. While there are limitations, there's also more possibilities than one realizes. A case in point is Charlie's learning to ride a bicycle and to play the piano; he learned the piano from a skilled teacher and from me, and the &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/freedom-of-movement-the-importance-of-riding-a-bike/"&gt;bicycle riding&lt;/a&gt;, from Jim alone. I can assure you, no one ever thought Charlie'd be riding a two-wheeler with hand brakes before he started talking in full sentences, or that he and Jim would ride for 12 miles through a couple of towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Around the world, visionary change agents are hard at work incubating new approaches to the planet's toughest challenges. Yet they're often doing so without taking advantage of the latest tools and thinking in technology, communications and innovation - or a network of experts, peers, and supporters who can help them truly change the world.

&lt;p&gt;The Pop!Tech Social Innovation Fellows program is designed to help fill that gap - to equip the next generation of world-changing innovators with the tools, insights, visibility and social network that can help them scale their impacts to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, Pop!Tech selects 10-20 high potential change agents from around the world who are working on highly disruptive innovations in areas like healthcare, energy, development, climate, education, and civic engagement, among many others. Fellows work in both the for-profit and not-for-profit worlds, have a minimum of 3-5 years experience, and are working in organizations that are well positioned for sustainable growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/XCdZn1QxPDU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here follow a transcription and translation of the entire song. One thing that will be immediately evident is the fondness of Beijingers for adding final retroflex -r to the end of many words. There seems, however, to be some disagreement among individual speakers on when to -r, as it were, and when not to -r. Our transcription distinguishes three categories of -r: bold for when the singer adds an -r that is not in the original lyrics, italics for when he fails to -r but we think he should, and regular -r when the original lyrics have an -r. Sometimes the -r is subtle and sometimes it is very obvious; given the complexities of the phenomenon, we cannot guarantee that we've recorded all of them to the satisfaction of Pekingese aficionados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that some of the tones and occasionally the vowel quality differ from what we would normally expect in Modern Standard Mandarin. The fact that it's a song also means that the contours of the melody sometimes are at odds with the tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the singer uses a few English expressions, so those appear both in the column with the Chinese lyrics and in the column with the translation. And there's at least one Pekingese morpheme (DER) in the lyrics for which there's no known character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;

In fact, on the scale of media whoredom, he’s somewhere in between the Westboro Baptist Church and PETA. And lately, as I’ve blogged before, the big banana’s been doing more more whoring than usual with the release of his old–err, I mean his new book (sorry, I got confused since all the arguments were the same) on Charles Darwin’s 200th birthday. What are the odds?! Ray’s also been promoting his new website, Pull the Plug on Atheist, which clearly is not just an ill-conceived attempt to get a rise out of atheists and those who subscribe to evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a recent news story that I don’t think I blogged about because I wanted to avoid giving The Banana Man the publicity that he craves so much involved Ray offering to pay PZ Myers to engage in a public debate. Having debated a sneaky, duplicitous Comfort before on the radio and not wanting to further the perception that creationism was something that is worthy of even being debated at all, Myers declined Comfort’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/got_100000.php"&gt;Comfort is offered to pay Richard Dawkins $10,000 to debate him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;amp;t=73020&amp;amp;p=1768570#p1768570"&gt;Dawkins has a counter-offer&lt;/a&gt;: he’ll do it for $100,000, to be donated to the RDF. Comfort has now upped the ante to $20,000. It’s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only would creationists have finally done something productive and contributed to the promulgation of reason for once, but the spectacle of this debate would be a source of endless hilarity for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard does have a few other requests: that Comfort reprise his banana argument, and that the event would have to be recorded by the RDF team, for the enlightenment of the world. It’s not too much to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of YouTube user Thunderf00t’s superb rejection of Youtube creationist VenomFangX’s request for a formal debate:&lt;/p&gt;

I apologize, and I invoke &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor"&gt;Hanlon's Razor&lt;/a&gt; in my defense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's that time of year again, though I wasn't sure until I Googled it. I'd been seeing ads for fish sandwiches at places that normally don't advertise their fish, so I figured Lent was coming up. Yesterday, they mentioned on the radio that it was Fat Tuesday, and therefore Mardi Gras. Much later in the day, the thought occurred to me: "Didn't that mean something about Ash Wednesday? Is that the day following Fat Tuesday, or the day preceding Maundy Thursday, which I'm pretty sure is the day before Good Friday, which is right before Easter?" I Googled Ash Wednesday, and it came up at the top: February 25th, 2009. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in &lt;i&gt;years&lt;/i&gt;, I was forewarned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, I don't know that I've ever celebrated Ash Wednesday in any particular fashion. I've certainly never participated in Lent, and I don't even remember hearing about it until I was in High School. Since then, and especially since I've been an atheist, I've thought of Ash Wednesday as "the day when it's rude to tell someone they've got a little dirt on their face." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't mean anything by it, really. It's not me flaunting my heathenness, it's not about belittling anyone's faith--as I &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2007/05/atheist-confessional.html"&gt;confessed&lt;/a&gt; some time ago, I just &lt;i&gt;don't realize it's intentional&lt;/i&gt; until after I say something. Open mouth, insert foot, hope there's no palm fronds on the bottom of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, that could potentially cause actual problems, since I'm working as a government employee around plenty of churchgoers of various sorts, and trying to be inconspicuous when I mumble over that one line of the Pledge of Allegiance each morning. So, for the first time in quite awhile, I enter into Ash Wednesday with the knowledge that it's Ash Wednesday, rather than figuring it out at 6:30 in the evening after seeing the seventh person in a row at Wal-Mart in need of a damp washcloth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally, while the rest of the nation is getting monochromatic face-painting, I'll be spending my afternoon judging a Science Fair. Good? Bad? I'm the guy with the clipboard.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-7770352364371505611?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235544654325"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2301">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e554105dcdbe5503</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Intelligent Design/Creationism"/><category term="Mark Sanford"/><category term="Minnesota"/><category term="Sarah Palin"/><category term="South Carolina"/><category term="Tim Pawlenty"/><title type="html">With Obama’s speech tonight, I almost forgot that politicians are often stupid</title><published>2009-02-25T06:45:07Z</published><updated>2009-02-25T06:45:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/with-obamas-speech-tonight-i-almost-forgot-that-politicians-are-often-stupid/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/131823.html"&gt;Here’s some pearls of wisdom from Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I think that it’s just, and science is more and more documenting this, is that there are real “chinks” in the armor of evolution being the only way we came about. The idea of there being a, you know, a little mud hole and two mosquitoes get together and the next thing you know you have a human being… is completely at odds with, you know, one of the laws of thermodynamics which is the law of, of … in essence, destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="the-more-you-know" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/the-more-you-know.jpg?w=170&amp;amp;h=111" alt="the-more-you-know" width="170" height="111"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks professor, but if it’s all the same with you, I’ll leave the science to the scientists, not the crazy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, responding to creationist statements by Sarah Palin,  said this little gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw her comments on it yesterday, and I thought they were appropriate, which is, you know, let’s — if there are competing theories, and they are credible, her view of it was, according to the comments in the newspaper, allow them all to be presented or allow them both to be presented so students could be exposed to both or more and have a chance to be exposed to the various theories and make up their own minds…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the scientific community, it seems like intelligent design is dismissed — not entirely, there are a lot of scientists who would make the case that it is appropriate to be taught and appropriate to be demonstrated, but in terms of the curriculum in the schools in Minnesota, we’ve taken the approach that that’s a local decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the key here is “if there are competing theories, and they are credible.” Creationism is neither a competing theory nor credible. So I guess then I agree with Pawlenty under those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

The article is worth reading but I’ve broken down the list below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Buying organically grown food&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Rejecting vaccines (I think this should have been #1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Recycling (I’ll admit it. As a child of the 80’s this one was hard to accept for a long time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Using antibacterial soap&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/02/attendance_at_religious_services_but_not_religious_devotion.php"&gt;new research is changing our understanding of the connection between religion and suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for all the speculation, very few people have examined the supposed link between religion and suicide attacks with an objective scientific eye. Enter&lt;a href="http://ginges.socialpsychology.org/"&gt; Jeremy Ginges&lt;/a&gt; from the New School for Social Research in New York. He has used four related studies to show that there is indeed a link between religion and support for suicide attacks, but it’s a complicated one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginges studied a wide variety of religious people from various cultures and faiths - from Palestinian Muslims to Israeli Jews, and from British Protestants to Indian Hindus. Across the board, Ginges found that a person’s stance on martyrdom had little to do with their religious devotion or to any particular religious belief. Instead, it was the collective side of religion that affected their stance - those who frequently took part in religious rituals and services, were most likely to support martyrdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various commentators have suggested that religious devotion makes it easier for people to buy into the ethos of suicide attacks because some religious beliefs denigrate those of other faiths, promise rewards in the afterlife or glorify the notion of martyrdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past 10 years major advances have been made in our ability to build transgenic pest strains that are conditionally sterile, harbor selfish genetic elements, and express anti-pathogen genes. Strategies are being developed that involve release into the environment of transgenic pest strains with such characteristics. These releases could provide more environmentally benign pest management and save endangered species, but steps must be taken to insure that this is the case and that there are no significant health or environmental risks associated with releases. Our conference will foster discussion of risks and benefits of these technologies among scientists, policy makers, and citizens. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004530" title=""&gt;Rich Pickings Near Large Communal Roosts Favor 'Gang' Foraging by Juvenile Common Ravens, Corvus corax&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ravens (Corvus corax) feed primarily on rich but ephemeral carcasses of large animals, which are usually defended by territorial pairs of adults. Non-breeding juveniles forage socially and aggregate in communal winter roosts, and these appear to function as 'information centers' regarding the location of the rare food bonanzas: individuals search independently of one another and pool their effort by recruiting each other at roosts. However, at a large raven roost in Newborough on Anglesey, North Wales, some juveniles have been observed recently to forage in 'gangs' and to roost separately from other birds. Here we adapt a general model of juvenile common raven foraging behavior where, in addition to the typical co-operative foraging strategy, such gang foraging behavior could be evolutionarily stable near winter raven roosts. We refocus the model on the conditions under which this newly documented, yet theoretically anticipated, gang-based foraging has been observed. In the process, we show formally how the trade off between search efficiency and social opportunity can account for the existence of the alternative social foraging tactics that have been observed in this species. This work serves to highlight a number of fruitful avenues for future research, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004577" title=""&gt;Does My Step Look Big In This? A Visual Illusion Leads To Safer Stepping Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tripping is a common factor in falls and a typical safety strategy to avoid tripping on steps or stairs is to increase foot clearance over the step edge. In the present study we asked whether the perceived height of a step could be increased using a visual illusion and whether this would lead to the adoption of a safer stepping strategy, in terms of greater foot clearance over the step edge. The study also addressed the controversial question of whether motor actions are dissociated from visual perception. 21 young, healthy subjects perceived the step to be higher in a configuration of the horizontal-vertical illusion compared to a reverse configuration (p = 0.01). During a simple stepping task, maximum toe elevation changed by an amount corresponding to the size of the visual illusion (p&amp;lt;0.001). Linear regression analyses showed highly significant associations between perceived step height and maximum toe elevation for all conditions. The perceived height of a step can be manipulated using a simple visual illusion, leading to the adoption of a safer stepping strategy in terms of greater foot clearance over a step edge. In addition, the strong link found between perception of a visual illusion and visuomotor action provides additional support to the view that the original, controversial proposal by Goodale and Milner (1992) of two separate and distinct visual streams for perception and visuomotor action should be re-evaluated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004589" title=""&gt;Sleep Restriction Increases the Risk of Developing Cardiovascular Diseases by Augmenting Proinflammatory Responses through IL-17 and CRP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sleep restriction, leading to deprivation of sleep, is common in modern 24-h societies and is associated with the development of health problems including cardiovascular diseases. Our objective was to investigate the immunological effects of prolonged sleep restriction and subsequent recovery sleep, by simulating a working week and following recovery weekend in a laboratory environment. After 2 baseline nights of 8 hours time in bed (TIB), 13 healthy young men had only 4 hours TIB per night for 5 nights, followed by 2 recovery nights with 8 hours TIB. 6 control subjects had 8 hours TIB per night throughout the experiment. Heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured after the baseline (BL), sleep restriction (SR) and recovery (REC) period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at these time points, counted and stimulated with PHA. Cell proliferation was analyzed by thymidine incorporation and cytokine production by ELISA and RT-PCR. CRP was increased after SR (145% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05), and continued to increase after REC (231% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05). Heart rate was increased after REC (108% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05). The amount of circulating NK-cells decreased (65% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.005) and the amount of B-cells increased (121% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.005) after SR, but these cell numbers recovered almost completely during REC. Proliferation of stimulated PBMC increased after SR (233% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05), accompanied by increased production of IL-1β (137% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05), IL-6 (163% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05) and IL-17 (138% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05) at mRNA level. After REC, IL-17 was still increased at the protein level (119% of BL; p&amp;lt;0.05). 5 nights of sleep restriction increased lymphocyte activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β IL-6 and IL-17; they remained elevated after 2 nights of recovery sleep, accompanied by increased heart rate and serum CRP, 2 important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, long-term sleep restriction may lead to persistent changes in the immune system and the increased production of IL-17 together with CRP may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004570" title=""&gt;Estimating the Worldwide Extent of Illegal Fishing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Illegal and unreported fishing contributes to overexploitation of fish stocks and is a hindrance to the recovery of fish populations and ecosystems. This study is the first to undertake a world-wide analysis of illegal and unreported fishing. Reviewing the situation in 54 countries and on the high seas, we estimate that lower and upper estimates of the total value of current illegal and unreported fishing losses worldwide are between $10 bn and $23.5 bn annually, representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes. Our data are of sufficient resolution to detect regional differences in the level and trend of illegal fishing over the last 20 years, and we can report a significant correlation between governance and the level of illegal fishing. Developing countries are most at risk from illegal fishing, with total estimated catches in West Africa being 40% higher than reported catches. Such levels of exploitation severely hamper the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Although there have been some successes in reducing the level of illegal fishing in some areas, these developments are relatively recent and follow growing international focus on the problem. This paper provides the baseline against which successful action to curb illegal fishing can be judged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004598" title=""&gt;How Many Loci Does it Take to DNA Barcode a Crocus?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;DNA barcoding promises to revolutionize the way taxonomists work, facilitating species identification by using small, standardized portions of the genome as substitutes for morphology. The concept has gained considerable momentum in many animal groups, but the higher plant world has been largely recalcitrant to the effort. In plants, efforts are concentrated on various regions of the plastid genome, but no agreement exists as to what kinds of regions are ideal, though most researchers agree that more than one region is necessary. One reason for this discrepancy is differences in the tests that are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed regions. Most tests have been made in a floristic setting, where the genetic distance and therefore the level of variation of the regions between taxa is large, or in a limited set of congeneric species. Here we present the first in-depth coverage of a large taxonomic group, all 86 known species (except two doubtful ones) of crocus. Even six average-sized barcode regions do not identify all crocus species. This is currently an unrealistic burden in a barcode context. Whereas most proposed regions work well in a floristic context, the majority will - as is the case in crocus - undoubtedly be less efficient in a taxonomic setting. However, a reasonable but less than perfect level of identification may be reached - even in a taxonomic context. The time is ripe for selecting barcode regions in plants, and for prudent examination of their utility. Thus, there is no reason for the plant community to hold back the barcoding effort by continued search for the Holy Grail. We must acknowledge that an emerging system will be far from perfect, fraught with problems and work best in a floristic setting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004616" title=""&gt;Evidence for Directional Selection at a Novel Major Histocompatibility Class I Marker in Wild Common Frogs (Rana temporaria) Exposed to a Viral Pathogen (Ranavirus)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is well characterized in the anuran Xenopus, this region has not previously been studied in another popular model species, the common frog (Rana temporaria). Nor, to date, have there been any studies of MHC in wild amphibian host-pathogen systems. We characterise an MHC class I locus in the common frog, and present primers to amplify both the whole region, and specifically the antigen binding region. As no more than two expressed haplotypes were found in over 400 clones from 66 individuals, it is likely that there is a single class I locus in this species. This finding is consistent with the single class I locus in Xenopus, but contrasts with the multiple loci identified in axolotls, providing evidence that the diversification of MHC class I into multiple loci likely occurred after the Caudata/Anura divergence (approximately 350 million years ago) but before the Ranidae/Pipidae divergence (approximately 230 mya). We use this locus to compare wild populations of common frogs that have been infected with a viral pathogen (Ranavirus) with those that have no history of infection. We demonstrate that certain MHC supertypes are associated with infection status (even after accounting for shared ancestry), and that the diseased populations have more similar supertype frequencies (lower FST) than the uninfected. These patterns were not seen in a suite of putatively neutral microsatellite loci. We interpret this pattern at the MHC locus to indicate that the disease has imposed selection for particular haplotypes, and hence that common frogs may be adapting to the presence of Ranavirus, which currently kills tens of thousands of amphibians in the UK each year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004609" title=""&gt;Does Sleep Play a Role in Memory Consolidation? A Comparative Test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sleep is a pervasive characteristic of mammalian species, yet its purpose remains obscure. It is often proposed that 'sleep is for the brain', a view that is supported by experimental studies showing that sleep improves cognitive processes such as memory consolidation. Some comparative studies have also reported that mammalian sleep durations are higher among more encephalized species. However, no study has assessed the relationship between sleep and the brain structures that are implicated in specific cognitive processes across species. The hippocampus, neocortex and amygdala are important for memory consolidation and learning and are also in a highly actived state during sleep. We therefore investigated the evolutionary relationship between mammalian sleep and the size of these brain structures using phylogenetic comparative methods. We found that evolutionary increases in the size of the amygdala are associated with corresponding increases in NREM sleep durations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NREM sleep is functionally linked with specializations of the amygdala, including perhaps memory processing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004607" title=""&gt;Decision-Making in Research Tasks with Sequential Testing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a recent controversial essay, published by JPA Ioannidis in PLoS Medicine, it has been argued that in some research fields, most of the published findings are false. Based on theoretical reasoning it can be shown that small effect sizes, error-prone tests, low priors of the tested hypotheses and biases in the evaluation and publication of research findings increase the fraction of false positives. These findings raise concerns about the reliability of research. However, they are based on a very simple scenario of scientific research, where single tests are used to evaluate independent hypotheses. In this study, we present computer simulations and experimental approaches for analyzing more realistic scenarios. In these scenarios, research tasks are solved sequentially, i.e. subsequent tests can be chosen depending on previous results. We investigate simple sequential testing and scenarios where only a selected subset of results can be published and used for future rounds of test choice. Results from computer simulations indicate that for the tasks analyzed in this study, the fraction of false among the positive findings declines over several rounds of testing if the most informative tests are performed. Our experiments show that human subjects frequently perform the most informative tests, leading to a decline of false positives as expected from the simulations. For the research tasks studied here, findings tend to become more reliable over time. We also find that the performance in those experimental settings where not all performed tests could be published turned out to be surprisingly inefficient. Our results may help optimize existing procedures used in the practice of scientific research and provide guidance for the development of novel forms of scholarly communication.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004601" title=""&gt;Biogeography of Photosynthetic Light-Harvesting Genes in Marine Phytoplankton&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Photosynthetic light-harvesting proteins are the mechanism by which energy enters the marine ecosystem. The dominant prokaryotic photoautotrophs are the cyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus that are defined by two distinct light-harvesting systems, chlorophyll-bound protein complexes or phycobilin-bound protein complexes, respectively. Here, we use the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) Project as a unique and powerful tool to analyze the environmental diversity of photosynthetic light-harvesting genes in relation to available metadata including geographical location and physical and chemical environmental parameters. All light-harvesting gene fragments and their metadata were obtained from the GOS database, aligned using ClustalX and classified phylogenetically. Each sequence has a name indicative of its geographic location; subsequent biogeographical analysis was performed by correlating light-harvesting gene budgets for each GOS station with surface chlorophyll concentration. Using the GOS data, we have mapped the biogeography of light-harvesting genes in marine cyanobacteria on ocean-basin scales and show that an environmental gradient exists in which chlorophyll concentration is correlated to diversity of light-harvesting systems. Three functionally distinct types of light-harvesting genes are defined: (1) the phycobilisome (PBS) genes of Synechococcus; (2) the pcb genes of Prochlorococcus; and (3) the iron-stress-induced (isiA) genes present in some marine Synechococcus. At low chlorophyll concentrations, where nutrients are limited, the Pcb-type light-harvesting system shows greater genetic diversity; whereas at high chlorophyll concentrations, where nutrients are abundant, the PBS-type light-harvesting system shows higher genetic diversity. We interpret this as an environmental selection of specific photosynthetic strategy. Importantly, the unique light-harvesting system isiA is found in the iron-limited, high-nutrient low-chlorophyll region of the equatorial Pacific. This observation demonstrates the ecological importance of isiA genes in enabling marine Synechococcus to acclimate to iron limitation and suggests that the presence of this gene can be a natural biomarker for iron limitation in oceanic environments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004603" title=""&gt;A Rice Gene of De Novo Origin Negatively Regulates Pathogen-Induced Defense Response&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How defense genes originated with the evolution of their specific pathogen-responsive traits remains an important problem. It is generally known that a form of duplication can generate new genes, suggesting that a new gene usually evolves from an ancestral gene. However, we show that a new defense gene in plants may evolve by de novo origination, resulting in sophisticated disease-resistant functions in rice. Analyses of gene evolution showed that this new gene, OsDR10, had homologs only in the closest relative, Leersia genus, but not other subfamilies of the grass family; therefore, it is a rice tribe-specific gene that may have originated de novo in the tribe. We further show that this gene may evolve a highly conservative rice-specific function that contributes to the regulation difference between rice and other plant species in response to pathogen infections. Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10-suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease. This enhanced disease resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA) and suppressed accumulation of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) as well as modified expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. These data and analyses provide fresh insights into the new biologic and evolutionary processes of a de novo gene recruited rapidly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCdZn1QxPDU"&gt;Beijing Natives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here follow a transcription and translation of the entire song. One thing that will be immediately evident is the fondness of Beijingers for adding final retroflex -r to the end of many words. There seems, however, to be some disagreement among individual speakers on when to -r, as it were, and when not to -r. Our transcription distinguishes three categories of -r: bold for when the singer adds an -r that is not in the original lyrics, italics for when he fails to -r but we think he should, and regular -r when the original lyrics have an -r. Sometimes the -r is subtle and sometimes it is very obvious; given the complexities of the phenomenon, we cannot guarantee that we've recorded all of them to the satisfaction of Pekingese aficionados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that some of the tones and occasionally the vowel quality differ from what we would normally expect in Modern Standard Mandarin. The fact that it's a song also means that the contours of the melody sometimes are at odds with the tones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the singer uses a few English expressions, so those appear both in the column with the Chinese lyrics and in the column with the translation. And there's at least one Pekingese morpheme (DER) in the lyrics for which there's no known character.&lt;/p&gt;

Wow! Just wow! Totally amazing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what a reminder of my White privilege - a couple of names there are familiar to me, as I have read their papers before, never ever stopping to think who they were or how they looked like!  What a wake-up call!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I have read several papers by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/02/faces_of_drug_abuse_research_c_1.php" title=""&gt;Chana Akins&lt;/a&gt;, as she works on Japanese quail. And I am somewhat familiar (being a history buff and obsessive reader of literature in my and related fields) with the work of Charles Henry Turner, covered in this carnival not once but twice - both by &lt;a href="http://urban-science.blogspot.com/2009/02/charles-henry-turner-animal-behavior.html" title=""&gt;Danielle Lee&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href="http://blackoncampus.com/2009/02/20/a-beautiful-black-mind-charles-henry-turner/" title=""&gt;Ajuan Mance&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

If you need directions please contact your dispatcher.  Thank you!\&amp;#39;" width="225"&gt;One of the disclosure issues that appeared in a thread over the weekend was the question of who needs to know about a diagnosis of ASD, and when disclosure will make a situation better or worse.  Unlike the role of disclosure in discrimination protection in the U.S., there are no specific rules about who to disclose to that are applicable to all people.  I'll list my rules, but with the disclaimer they may not be good rules for everyone to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in a geographical location that is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7e7lxufde0"&gt;very accepting of the unusual&lt;/a&gt;.  So disclosure doesn't result in the kind of stigma that might occur elsewhere.  I also don't "pass for normal"--people pretty much know "something" is not typical about me though they may not be able to name it.  So for me disclosure tends to improve my interpersonal interactions enormously because people then aren't assuming things like that I am dishonest (cue from lack of eye contact) or rude (cue from idiosyncratic communication).  I am comfortable with my identity as an autistic person.  So communicating "I'm autistic" isn't any bigger a deal to me than communicating, "I'm Italian-American." &lt;em&gt;Similar context is not shared by all people on the spectrum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From within my context, these are my rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Full disclosure to friends, family, and in situations where full disclosure is necessary to access services, accommodations, or discrimination protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Full disclosure if the situation is of survival-level importance or serious problems could result for myself or others from mismanagement of the situation.  Examples: paratransit drivers (yes, the photo with this post is my hand and my notebook), law enforcement, medical personnel, or insurance or financial institutions where I need to explain why I am requesting the institution speak with my representative instead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Full disclosure if I will be interacting with the person multiple times over a long period of time.  For example teachers, co-workers, and the family veternarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Need-to-know limited disclosure to meet short-term needs in a specific interaction with a stranger.  This means I will disclose limited information about my disabilities specific to an interaction.  For example, strangers often go blah blah blah at me with their mouths too fast for me to process.  So I advocate for my needs with scripts like, "I have virtually no short term memory for what I hear, could you please give me one idea at a time and wait while I write each down?"  This partial disclosure I've found to be important because otherwise the person may think I'm just being difficult.  Letting a person know there's a medical necessity behind my request makes the person much more pleasant and accommodating.  But all they need to know is the exact difficulty I'm having, not the broader scope of my diagnosis--it's important in these situations to &lt;em&gt;keep things as simple as possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. No disclosure: To any person that falls outside of the above situations I don't disclose.  Like if I'm at the bus stop and someone asks me what time the bus is coming and it takes me 3 minutes to figure out and communicate the answer, I don't preface it with "that took me a long time because I am autistic," I just give the answer and leave it at that.  Disclosure to one-time strangers in non-critical situations I've found to be just confusing &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_much_information"&gt;TMI&lt;/a&gt; that makes things harder for me (and others) not easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of these cases, I have scripts or communication cards (like the notebook page pictured) that I have developed to assist with the various types of disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was first developing these rules and scripts, I asked the therapist I was working with whether people would stigmatize me more if they knew the name of my disability.  She said, "Anyone who will stigmatize you because they know the diagnosis would also stigmatize you if they didn't know the diagnosis."  Disclosure may improve interactions with people who are open to understanding, but disclosure will not necessarily improve interactions with those who are truly bigoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strong caution I give is that some people (including me) may find a disclosure to the wrong person at the wrong time to be problematic or even potentially dangerous.  Each individual's situation will have to be taken from within its own context when developing safe rules for who to disclose an ASD diagnosis to.  There is no "one size fits all."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235519297353"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/?p=1001">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa4b35396ea9c06e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad science"/><category term="mail"/><category term="onanism"/><category term="references"/><title type="html">“Facebook causes cancer”</title><published>2009-02-24T23:43:27Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T23:43:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/the-evidence-aric-sigman-ignored/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">I was on newsnight a second ago, debating the rather indulgent claims of Baroness Professor Susan Greenfield and Dr Aric Sigman about Facebook and Twitter.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;Life is stressful and excellent in equal measures, and I realised recently that that also describes some of my favourite albums. I believe myself to be melodramatic, having extreme high joy times and equally extreme down days (a shade bi-polar perhaps, but I’m high-functioning and fun so I don’t think I need to worry). My mood can change at the flip of a switch, and nothing cheers me up or pulls me down so much as music. Below are three albums which contain extreme high and low points for me, emotionally. You are welcome to laugh at my choices, agree, or simply offer your own. Individual songs don’t count, it has to be an entire album which takes you through the full gamut of emotions. Let’s hear ‘em.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Poses – Rufus Wainwright&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;High point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;: Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&lt;br&gt;
Cry point: Poses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;The first time I heard &lt;em&gt;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&lt;/em&gt; was a few days after I’d met a guy I would go on to have a six-year relationship with. During our first meeting, I purchased two items for him. Guess what they were? Coincidences are always exciting, although the song is awesome anyway. Lots of people find Rufus depressing, and &lt;em&gt;Poses&lt;/em&gt; (also the name of the album) is a good example of why. It’s quite droney, but I really like that quality in his voice, and the lyrics tell the story of a fall from an essentially shallow grace: “I did go from wanting to be someone now I’m drunk and wearing flip - flops on Fifth Avenue”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Honky Château – Elton John&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;High point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;: Think I’m Going to Kill Myself&lt;br&gt;
Cry point: Think I’m Going to Kill Myself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;This album is brilliant (although the best EJ album is Tumbleweed Connection, of course), and &lt;em&gt;Think I’m Going to Kill Myself&lt;/em&gt; is both the emotional high and low point. High because it’s upbeat, it makes me want to move, it contains a tapdance solo by Larry ‘Legs’ Smith and is massive fun to sing along to, low because it’s about teenage suicide. The jolliness is ironic or something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Something – Shirley Bassey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;High point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;: Spinning Wheel&lt;br&gt;
Cry point: Yesterday When I Was Young&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I realise that my music choices are a little…camp, but camps are where the best emotional rollercoasters are to be found. Shush, it doesn’t have to make sense. Shirley Bassey is amazing, and Something is one of my favourite albums of all time. I dare you not to jump up and start grooving to &lt;em&gt;Spinning Wheel&lt;/em&gt;. From the opening bars it sparks a little happy in my heart and whichever part of my pants the soul resides in. By contrast, &lt;em&gt;Yesterday When I Was Young&lt;/em&gt; depresses the hell out of me. I’m protesting aging every step of the way, and this song takes the worst of old age (and none of the greatness like free bus travel) and wrings out every drop of sentiment like a musical Miss Haversham. “The friends I made, all seemed somehow to drift away, And only I am left, on stage to end the play”. This is true melodrama. R.E.S.P.E.C.T.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235515674286"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/24/chamonix-summary-cern/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6adb63feaa851a42</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Chamonix Summary @ CERN</title><published>2009-02-24T22:05:59Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T22:05:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/24/chamonix-summary-cern/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the week of February 6, a &lt;a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=45433"&gt;workshop on the LHC performance &lt;/a&gt;was held in Chamonix, France. All of the main LHC machine folks gathered there, in one room, and discussed their strategy for the start of operations of the LHC, for all aspects of the accelerator. &lt;a href="http://user.web.cern.ch/user/QuickLinks/Announcements/2009/090206_chamonix.html"&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt; have appeared on the blogosphere, for example &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/09/lhc-2009-restart/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=1589"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s new is that this afternoon at CERN, a 3 hour &lt;a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&amp;amp;confId=52248"&gt;summary of the workshop &lt;/a&gt;was given in the main auditorium. And I was there. The auditorium was packed, and the audience peppered the speakers with questions. The CERN staff certainly appreciated the opportunity to hear the summaries and to ask questions. I know I did. It’s one thing to sit in California and read the slides and perhaps watch the video stream, but it’s another thing to be there in person, listen to the discourse, and to ask questions myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks ranged from safety issues, to what they learned with and without their few days of beam in 2008, to their plans for the next run. And here is the official schedule for the 2009/2010 run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the most interesting part of the talks was information on the next run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accelerator physicists presented the lab management with two options for the 09/10 run, depending on how many of the pressure relief valves in the arcs would be installed before the run. It’s worth noting that the full quench system will be operational in either scheme and that the pressure relief valves only serve to stem possible damage, i.e., they are not preventive. The accelerator guys were split on which plan was better. Management opted for the plan which gave beam in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule is tight with no room for contingency in case of slippage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, they are 1.5 weeks behind schedule, which is actually very good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will have a short run (few days?) with collisions at injection energy (450 GeV per beam). This is at the request of the general purpose experiments (ATLAS and CMS) in order to aid in the calibration of their detectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will then run at 4 TeV per beam for a limited time (I asked specifically about this afterwards and was given various answers about the length of time at 4 TeV). Clearly, they will ramp up the beam when (and not before) they feel it is safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they will run at 5 TeV per beam with the goal of collecting 200 inverse picobarns of luminosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, they must run during the winter months December 09 – February 2010. CERN accelerators do not normally run during the winter months as the cost of electricity is 3 times higher than for the rest of the year. The additional electric bill for running the LHC during these months is $8M Euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how the lab is going to pay the additional electricity costs and the lab staff is clearly concerned about cuts, but management thinks it is manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear that the LHC will ever run at the design energy of 14 TeV. There is a problem with the number of expected magnet quenches as one tunes the beam from 6.5 to 7 TeV. Namely, it’s alarmingly high. They don’t know why yet, but are working on it. It is possible that the maximum energy the machine will ultimately reach is 13 TeV in the center of mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the news is good. They are expecting a reasonable set of good quality data at high energies with good discovery potential. Colliders are always slow to start up (just ask Fermilab), and the LHC will get to design parameters in good time.&lt;/p&gt;

In our experience, costs have sometimes been incurred for much more elemental matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about.............plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our old house---a lovely woodframe 1920s structure---had only one bathroom, on the second floor. When we moved into it some years ago, Charlie was still a fan of the Teletubbies, and of re-enacting the conclusion of the show, when the Tubbies wave "bye bye" and jump into the roof-hole of their Tubby house. It had apparently been observed by Charlie that there lurked a fixture in our household down which Teletubbies (he had plastic figurines of all four, and a stuffed NooNoo) could jump or be, well, immersed, and woe to the person (adults especially) who made this realization &lt;em&gt;post facto&lt;/em&gt;. At one point, I became quite skilled in snaking my rubber-glove clad hand and arm into the furthest recesses of white porcelain, hoping that I must just reach a plastic Tubby (miraculously, I rescused LaaLaa successfully a few times) or a double Lego Dupo piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Lego I was, alas, not able to grasp and down the pipe it went. Or so I hoped, my mind visualizing whether the piece (it was rather big) would actually be able to make it down. While it apparently did so for some months, eventually its passage was hindered, with a resulting obstruction of the pipes, and the appearance of much of something in the laundry sink. A plumber was called and, after a short while, he produced the long-missing, and still green, Lego Dupo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time, even as I was castigating Charlie, I was equally kicking myself for not being vigilant and for making an overly big deal about the whole thing in the first place. Those were moments when I'd remind myself, parenting comes with its......perks, and the parent of a child on the spectrum should be wary of "blaming" everything that happens on autism. Things happen, there are plenty of plumbers, and you pay the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday we had a semi-extensive plumbing issue and, like an ingrained reaction, a litany of Things Dropped into the Toilet, from iPods to chew tubes, entered my mind. Charlie, who has grown out of Teletubbies, also knows full well what goes in &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; and what doesn't.  Can't be, I said to myself, there's been no sticking stuff in the toilet for months, years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim waited for the plumber and only called me at work to reveal the source of blockage, which had somehow come in via the roof and gotten itself into what turned out to be a sewage pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plumber said it was the first squirrel he'd seen in fifteen years, I was informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thinking, what a way to go, I asked how Charlie on his final day of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/learning_to_like_vacation"&gt;vacation&lt;/a&gt; was doing, and the report was good. He'd stood around nonchalantly when the plumber and his assistant came in, and walked past them to get a soda from the fridge, no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things really do change.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me say that as far as offering us significant new insights into what atheism is all about, Eller's book is the best damn book out there, bar none, hands down, without question. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you value my advice at all you need to read this book. It is absolutely brilliant! While I'm not yet convinced of everything he argues for, the book has challenged my own thinking on the issues he writes about. If you want an intellectual feast, get this book. Every atheist should read it. If you are a Christian apologist you need to deal with his book. No Christian apologist in the future worthy of being called an apologist should be without Eller's book and be able to articulate some kind of lame response to it (because that's the only response apologists will be able to give it). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eller does not deal with many issues that other atheist books cover (like philosophical arguments against the existence of God, the problem of evil, and so forth), so you'll still want other atheist books as well. It's just that his book is on my limited essential list of atheist books to have in your library.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the highest praise I have ever written about any book, and it's probably because after having read so many atheist books I thought I had read up on most of the issues, but I was wrong. I learned a great deal from Eller's book even after having read so many other works of this nature that it took me completely by surprise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can read an earlier post describing what I thought of the first six chapters &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/dr-david-eller-interviewed-about-his.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, where you can also watch an interview with him. I also wrote on one his arguments &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/skeptically-speaking.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have posted a review of his book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atheism-Advanced-Further-Thoughts-Freethinker/review/product/1578840023/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#RG7NPENGAI3DE"&gt;here on amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

I would emphatically state that during Israel’s evolution from polytheism to monotheism has totally eclipsed the Semitic etymology here in favor of the non-Semitic Greek. ]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Yahweh demands the Hebrews / Israelites put him first over all the other gods (Please note: Nowhere does Yahweh say these other gods don’t exist, but rather that only he alone wants to be their god-king). Thus, it is plainly obvious that Yahweh himself believes in other gods just a these other gods also believed in him or (to put it another way;&lt;strong&gt; Yahweh is not an atheist&lt;/strong&gt;). Thus, under Josiah’s reforms, all other Beth El’s or other Houses of Gods must be destroyed thus cutting off their food and leaving only Israel’s leading god’s (Yahweh) temple in Jerusalem alone honored with sacrifices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In conclusion&lt;/span&gt;, when we come to the &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LXX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the New Testament (which is based on the &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LXX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) we do not find Yahweh as simply another god fearing other deities of the Israelites anymore (or even the name Yahweh itself), but an alone and the only real &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who himself no longer believes in any other living deities, but considers all other forms of competing gods simply worthless and dead idols (See the atheistic theologies to wards other gods in the Acts of the Apostles and St. Paul’s theology). Put another way, the &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the New Testament is now fully an atheist when it comes to belief in any god or gods!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here a some closing questions to consider:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. When did Yahweh lose his faith / belief in other Gods?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. Why does the atheistic &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (θεός) feel that the religious belief of the Semitic Yahweh was wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. Does the atheistic Greek &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; even deny the ancient Semitic, but religious&lt;br&gt;(faithfully believing) Yahweh himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D. Can the Biblical text reconcile the atheistic &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Theos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with Yahweh’s faith in other gods? (Can the &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LXX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and its later sibling (the New Testament) ever be really reconciled with the MT text?

Then, under protest, they gave Jerry Coyne an opportunity to rebut (good). Now, after all that, they add another, final word to the whole mess…and guess who they published?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/forbes-loses-it-again-over-evolution/"&gt;Phillip Skell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you newbies to Pharyngula have never heard of the fellow, but he's a wacky evolution denialist who got obsessed with me several years ago, and &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/creationist_e_mail_phil_skell/"&gt;dunned me with email&lt;/a&gt;. (Actually, I think he might be one of the first kooks to inspire my "I get email" series.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's got one note that he plays repeatedly and discordantly: evolution doesn't matter. It's a scam. Biologists just made it all up. &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/skell_again/"&gt;You don't need to use evolutionary theory to explain &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing has changed in his Forbes article, except that he must be on his meds now: he's dialed back the crazy shrillness, but he's still whining about the same silly point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIll Forbes get the message? They had to go to the Discovery Institute to find their initial mob of loons, and now to reply to Coyne (with a mass of irrelevancies, of course), they had to really scrape deep in the bottom of the barrel. Perhaps next they'll give some space to Ray Comfort, or the Time Cube guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/whats_the_matter_with_forbes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/9zj7aJ9eg18" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235511736494"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9136971082787701733">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a918d0b8f355df5c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Why We Immunize</title><published>2009-02-24T21:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T21:37:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/why-we-immunize.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/9136971082787701733/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=9136971082787701733" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Normally I don&amp;#39;t write about the people who oppose immunizing children.

And very pretty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/assets/img/022209_PICAX_photo.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/spacex_picax_test.jpg" alt="Space X tests the PICA-X material"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/press.php?page=20090223"&gt;That’s a test of the PICA-X (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator) material&lt;/a&gt;, a variant of the material NASA uses on its heat shields to protect astronauts during re-entry. It was developed by the private company Space X to use on their Dragon capsule, which will ferry materials and astronauts into space. In the pictures, it’s being blasted by a very hot (up to 1850 C) arc jet at the NASA Ames Research Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Dragon capsule re-enters, it will violently compress the air in front of it. A compressed gas heats up, and that’s why materials coming back from space must be protected. PICA (originally developed by NASA) actually heats up, melts, and blows away (ablates), taking the heat with it. Enough material is coated on the windward surface to make sure it lasts through the whole process.  In a sense, it’s like sweating, but on a somewhat grander and scarier scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragon is slated to launch sometime this year on a Falcon 9 rocket. Space X has not yet launched a Falcon 9, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/12/falcon-9-standing-tall/"&gt;but plans on doing so soon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

But the best conferences are usually pretty small. Following this logic, the best conferences must be microconferences - just a few intrepid explorers gathering in some remote place on Earth....like Norfolk, for example, sharing fish and chips and shooting a movie about Darwin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow, there is just such a conference! &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/groups/nnbloggername/forum/topics/3275" title=""&gt;Cromer Is So Bracing '09&lt;/a&gt; (or Cromer International Science Blogging, if you want to be extra nice....or grandiose...). Oh, I so wish I could go there and share beer with my friends, including the venerable host Henry Gee.  Even the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/04/eurotrip_08_the_cromer_menager.php" title=""&gt;place is familiar&lt;/a&gt; to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I missed the deadline to start swimming, and anyway, Atlantic is pretty cold at this time of year. I heard there are other methods of crossing the ocean as well.  Some of those are limited to a small number of people who can afford it.  Others are limited to an even smaller number of people who are capable of walking on water (I am not one of those - trust me, I tried).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I will have to settle for a long-distance virtual coverage of this momentous meeting. I hope you will follow it as well. Check the &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23CISB" title=""&gt;#CISB&lt;/a&gt; hashtag on Twitter, check in the &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/cisb-09" title=""&gt;CISB'09 FriendFeed room&lt;/a&gt; and follow Henry's &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/tags/cromer%20is%20so%20bracing" title=""&gt;'cromer is so bracing' category&lt;/a&gt; on his blog (I am not aware of a Facebook event for this). I am sure other participants will blog it as well. The homepage for the meeting is &lt;a href="http://www.chiswick.demon.co.uk/CISB09.html" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there will also be a live-stream feed on &lt;a href="http://www.mogulus.com/steelgraham" title=""&gt;Graham Steel's&lt;/a&gt; page on Mogulus. I can't wait to see the Darwin movie &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/henrygee/blog/2009/02/24/cromer-curtain-raiser" title=""&gt;they'll produce&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To friends of life on Earth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a dark force working to undermine all ecosystems on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This force is a trans-century cult that calls itself the Illuminati -- because its members believe that one day they will be "illuminated" and become gods on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illuminati members have infiltrated all world politics and control all financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have engineered the present financial crisis and they are responsible for the events of 9/11 and for the majority of false-flag events in recent history. Through war and other means, they are responsible for the hyper-poisoning of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth will not survive their machinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio interviews from ex-cult members Svali and Mary Ann:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freemasons' connection to the Illuminati:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UX2KA0mDE"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ks_AVND3g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Illuminati are the secret players behind the present apocalyptic political scene, and they must be brought out from behind the curtain before our planet is destroyed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Illuminati cult members are held to the cult by fear alone and would turn away from it, if it were challenged by the light of public inquiry.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be removed from this list, please hit reply, type remove in the subject line, and hit send.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate Jock's leaving me instructions on how to get off of his e-mail list, but the material he supplied me about the Illuminati was so fascinating that I don't know if I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be taken off his list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, Jock Doubleday, if you recall, is the genius behind the bogus &lt;a href="http://www.spontaneouscreation.org/SC/$75,000VaccineOffer.htm"&gt;$180,000 Vaccine Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, a challenge that, &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/464"&gt;whenever someone actually offers to take him up on it&lt;/a&gt;, he seems to find a reason to run away. Indeed, several doctors &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/gentlebirth.htm"&gt;have offered to take him up on it&lt;/a&gt;. After this kind e-mail from Jock, I'm half-tempted to take him up on it myself. I realize it's a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=322"&gt;totally bogus challenge&lt;/a&gt;, but it might provide me with amusement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/the_pharma_shill_gambit_1.php"&gt;pharma shill&lt;/a&gt; that I am, I must obviously be part of the Illuminati. I'll be fine, no matter how many "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/cries_the_antivaccinationist_why_are_we.php"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;" Jock tries to get me to swallow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/i_get_e-mail_too.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/NTHPzE_Sf0M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235506559426"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4001">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28aecf6098cfe595</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Bernie Madoff"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="Interviews"/><category term="James Altucher"/><title type="html">For Madoff, Reputation Is Apparently a One-Way Street</title><published>2009-02-24T20:34:32Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T20:34:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/hize79GPh9U/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/for-madoff-reputation-is-apparently-a-one-way-street/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Our friend James Altucher, in an interview at Yahoo!'s Tech Ticker, talks about visiting Bernie Madoff and his son Mark back in early 2005 to pitch them his fund of funds:

I don’t know why it did that, I just know it made me want to die as it’s chipper lyric bled through the heavy metal in my earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ARealGirl/status/1199148405"&gt;Twittered&lt;/a&gt; about it, and an old friend of my emailed me to remind me that was the chosen song for one of the high school dances I either didn’t attend or don’t remember.  The old friend &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; remember, with much fondness. For many paragraphs. About unremarkable stuff that happened 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t share the fondness for the “glory days.”  I’m glad to be who I am today, perfectly happy to be an imperfect adult instead of the impetuous teen.  I’m an onward and upward sort of gal, I guess.  I still cherish the 10 friends I made at 16, that’s true, but I don’t want to go back to when we met.  I’m all good right here, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not counting these days,  what are your “glory days”?  Do you remember them fondly?  Long for their return? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>a.real.girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235502975315"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1177">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb8e3ef4572b510d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Hobgoblins</title><published>2009-02-24T19:13:06Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T19:13:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1177" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://topics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/hobgoblins/"&gt;this morning's After Deadline post&lt;/a&gt;, that's what Philip B. Corbett at the New York Times calls "rules that aren't", following the lead of Theodore M. Bernstein:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Another pet peeve of some After Deadline commenters is the use of “but” or “and” to begin a sentence — as in the third sentence of the previous section. Obviously, I don’t share their aversion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It shouldn’t be overdone, but using coordinating conjunctions this way can provide a handy and very efficient transition. “But” is certainly preferable in many cases to the stilted “however,” and “and” is simpler than “in addition” or similar phrases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I’d put this objection in the category of “Miss Thistlebottom’s hobgoblins.” That’s how the former Times language guru Theodore M. Bernstein described overly fastidious rules and usage myths a grade-school English teacher might invoke to keep her pupils’ prose on a very narrow path. (Familiar examples include “Never split an infinitive” and “Never end a sentence with a preposition.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mr. Corbett is being polite to his commenters, I think, by calling these strictures "overly fastidious" (as opposed, say, to "preposterous fabrications").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Zwicky has suggested the term &amp;quot;Zombie Rule&amp;quot; for things like this — see &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=536"&gt;When zombie rules attack&lt;/a&gt;", 8/26/2008, and "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003723.html"&gt;However, …&lt;/a&gt;", 11/1/2006, and "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002189.html"&gt;Five more thoughts on the that rule&lt;/a&gt;", 5/22/2005.  In a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=475#comment-7079"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;, Language Hat once mentioned "Aloysius Thistlebottom and his fellow half-dozen members of the Preserve English the Way it Was in Queen Victoria's Time (But Not Much Further Back Because Then It Gets to Be Too Much Trouble) Society", so apparently the Thistlebottom family has more than one member in this line of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/17/17-156.html"&gt;Miss Fidditch&lt;/a&gt;, who would "rather parse than eat", is a relative. (She's the patron saint of computational linguistics, or at least she should be.

&lt;p&gt; If you’re in the Boulder, Colorado area on February 27, then I highly recommend heading to the Fiske Planetarium, where my friend Luisa Rebull &lt;a href="http://fiske.colorado.edu/calendar/events/star-formation-w_-spitzer-space-telescope"&gt;will be talking about star formation and the Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. Her talk is centered around &lt;a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2009-03/release.shtml"&gt;this way cool image of the spiral galaxy M101&lt;/a&gt;, so if you get the chance you really should attend. &lt;a href="http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/~rebull/"&gt;Luisa’s pretty cool&lt;/a&gt;, and I know her talk will be a lot of fun.

Apparently a combination of 95% tax rates and a flood of unwashed Mexicans is going to provoke militias made of Bubbas to rise up against the U.S. government.  Also, Obama is going to force states to accept stimulus money against their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beck follows up by explaining how God fits into all this.  The answer is:  God gave this country freedom, and God has a method of communicating to us when our freedoms are being taken away.  That method, apparently, goes through the gut.  Imminent threats to freedom are foreshadowed, if I understand correctly, by a mild sort of indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think this is an isolated case, but here is &lt;a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/the_goon_alan_keyes.php"&gt;Alan Keyes&lt;/a&gt; — who used to have a TV show, and was recruited by the Illinois Republican party to run for Senate, and therefore must be taken more seriously in some quarters than random fulminators on internet message boards — also warning darkly of the coming civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it may have already begun.  If I understand this article from &lt;a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=30807"&gt;HumanEvents.com&lt;/a&gt; correctly, several states have already declared sovereignty, paving the way to full-scale secession from the Union.

Comfort has now upped the ante to $20,000. It's not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would encourage teams of creationist philanthropists to get together, scrape up the $100K, and pass it along to Comfort, who will then deposit it in the coffers of the Richard Dawkins Foundation. Not only would creationists have finally done something productive and contributed to the promulgation of reason for once, but the spectacle of this debate would be a source of endless hilarity for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard does have a few other requests: that Comfort reprise his banana argument, and that the event would have to be recorded by the RDF team, for the enlightenment of the world.

As DrugMonkey notes, such a strategy can have bad consequences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If there is a scientific trainee who fears to mention to the Boss that the printers aren't working, this trainee sure as hell isn't going to mention "Oh gee, I think that figure you are so amped about from that other postdoc is totally faked". And who knows how far this PI-pleasing attitude might carry one.

&lt;p&gt;Is the desire to keep the boss PI happy greater than any affection for, say, genuine data?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion in the comments covered some familiar ground about the general unpleasantness of the experience of science as gladiatorial combat, the relative powerlessness of the scientific trainee relative to the PI or even the most favored postdoc, the need to believe in your own results (even if, objectively, you should not) in a climate of shrinking funding, whether science is or is not a tea party peopled with Care Bears (and if so, what exactly that would entail) ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, reading this exchange, I slipped into my committee-chair mindset.  (Of course, this is very odd, seeing as how my current sabbatical has included a break from committee service.  Could it be that I miss it?)  I thought to myself, "The people here have rational reasons for the ways they're behaving, even if those behaviors lead to predictably bad results.  Are there any easy-to-implement changes that would make it rational for them to behave in ways that probably bring about better results?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I slipped into pedagogy mode (since I'm also on a hiatus from teaching) and thought, "Students focus on learning the things you test them on, not the things you &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; are important for them to learn.  And when you don't give them any sensible information about what you're evaluating, or about the basis for evaluation, they will become bundles of hate, fear, and frustration."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had a flash of insight  to a change that I think has potential.  I can't guarantee that it would work, but I think it would be foolish not to try it.&lt;br&gt;

Currently a person can not, according strictly to the letter of the DSM, be diagnosed with both neurodevelopmental disorders at once.  The neurodevelopmental group is working on possible re-definitions of autism spectrum disorders for the new version of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt; (DSM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the DSM may currently place some restrictions on which letters can go with which other letters, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5727101.ece"&gt;this article from Times Online&lt;/a&gt; asks the question, "Does having a clutch of acronyms after their names help or hinder children with multiple behaviour problems?"  and then proceeds to discuss kids being diagnosed with multiple neurodevelopmental and/or psychological disorders from the DSM including the ASD/ADD dual diagnosis.  The article raised some interesting (to me anyway) different ideas about where the sudden explosion of DSM diagnoses might be coming from, including some non-medical ones such as changing social and cultural norms and misdiagnoses based on not properly looking at lifestyle (e.g. difficulty concentrating because of lack of sufficient sleep).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still pretty interested in the dynamic between &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/what_is_normal_in_medicine_and_society"&gt;culture defining medicine and medicine defining culture&lt;/a&gt;, especially when it comes to the DSM.  That book has been a tool of both good (in getting people access to services they may need for survival) and great ill (e.g. the horrors done to homosexuals in the name of "treatment"), and the book is definitely not without &lt;a href="http://www.oregoncounseling.org/Diagnosis/CriticismOfDSM.htm"&gt;strong criticism of its development and usefulness&lt;/a&gt;, even by the people who use it.  The Times Online article talks about the destructive force of misdiagnosis, especially when a person is given medications for something they don't have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much power, unchecked, should the people who define items in the DSM be given?  Do we give too much?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235498503021"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7565074c49335ed3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><title type="html">Meetings I'd like to go to....Part I</title><published>2009-02-24T17:44:25Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T17:44:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/aUs1E_kAlI8/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/meetings_id_like_to_go_topart.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ebrs2009.u-strasbg.fr/" title=""&gt;XI Congress of the European Biological Rhythms Society, organized in association with the Japanese Society for Chronobiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I think that it's just, and science is more and more documenting this, is that there are real "chinks" in the armor of evolution being the only way we came about. The idea of there being a, you know, a little mud hole and two mosquitoes get together and the next thing you know you have a human being... is completely at odds with, you know, one of the laws of thermodynamics which is the law of, of ... in essence, destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know, it's the South, the domain of knuckle-dragging bibliolators. So guess who said this a little more recently, in reference to Sarah Palin's pro-creationist comments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw her comments on it yesterday, and I thought they were appropriate, which is, you know, let&amp;#39;s — if there are competing theories, and they are credible, her view of it was, according to the comments in the newspaper, allow them all to be presented or allow them both to be presented so students could be exposed to both or more and have a chance to be exposed to the various theories and make up their own minds...

In the scientific community, it seems like intelligent design is dismissed — not entirely, there are a lot of scientists who would make the case that it is appropriate to be taught and appropriate to be demonstrated, but in terms of the curriculum in the schools in Minnesota, we&amp;#39;ve taken the approach that that&amp;#39;s a local decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's our very own Governor Tim Pawlenty, of the eminently Yankee state of Minnesota. Shrivels the cockles of my heart, he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest nonsense from Sanford: he is refusing to use the money in Obama's stimulus package to help the economically afflicted people of his state; instead, &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2009/02/23/sanford-prayers/"&gt;he offers prayers&lt;/a&gt;. That is the very definition of the uselessness of right-wing Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Location clarified at the urgent request of many embarrassed North Carolinians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/dont_remind_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/wsoex1lz6og" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235493119692"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=446">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8264837b5acdd831</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Cat Child Found in Cave!</title><published>2009-02-24T16:01:15Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T16:01:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=446" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;(X-posted on &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6186"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vikki Thomas, intrepid journalist for &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2263881.ece"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;, reports that “A CAT-BOY has stunned medics with his ability to SEE in pitch black with eyes that GLOW in the dark.” All the preceding CAPITAL LETTERS are THE SUN’S, possibly designed to FREAK YOU THE HELL OUT because OMG CAT-BOY WILL DESTROY US ALL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Nong Youhui was supposedly brought to a hospital by his dad Ling, who claimed that the boy’s freaky blue eyes gave him the power of superior night vision and thus allowing him to read in pitch blackness. Amazingly, the article also claims that the boy can see perfectly well in the daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say BULLSHIT. Yeah, I can use capitals, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Cat-boys fate" src="http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/1090/batboy.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="305"&gt;First of all, cats can see better in the dark due to eyes that operate in a very different way from humans’, thanks to a very long history of evolving along completely different tracks. For instance, cats have pupils that narrow to slits and grow much larger than yours to let more light in while hunting in the dark. They also have larger lenses to absorb even more light, and they even have an extra part called the tapetum lucidum that bounces light back and forth to give them another chance at seeing something in the dark (that’s what causes the gleam when you shine a light at a cat’s eyes). Cats also have more rods, the photoreceptors that benefit night vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the boy somehow managed to procure similar eyeballs to a cat, all those attributes come at a cost. A cat cannot, as the article states, see “as clearly as most people do during the day.” In exchange for better night vision, the cat gives up the ability to focus on near objects and the handy tool of depth perception. Their greater number of rods results in fewer cones, removing their ability to see sharp detail and rich color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is: you can’t have your night-vision cake and eat it in broad daylight, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s where else your bullshit detector should have rung. The Sun’s only offered explanation for this eerie happening is the following sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe he was born with a rare condition called leukodermia which has left his eyes with less protective pigment and more sensitive to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leukodermia, also known as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukodermia"&gt;vitiligo&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t associated with cat-like supervision – it’s most often associated with Michael Jackson, since it happens to be that disorder in which you get blotchy patches on your skin and hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15071800?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;A study of 100 patients&lt;/a&gt; with the disorder did find a strong correlation with vision problems, so if anything, the kid would be worse off. The article suggests that the disorder makes one more sensitive to light, which is true, but not in the idiotic way that The Sun suggests. “More sensitive” means that it is painful for people with certain ocular disorders to see in daylight, which impairs their vision, not helping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the real explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s hard to say, since the article doesn’t give us the name of the hospital, the doctors involved in these “medical tests,” or even a god damned picture of the mysterious glowing eyeballs. Oh, and this is the very same newspaper that previously brought us &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2255989.ece"&gt;a story on the Lost City of Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; with a photo of Patrick Duffy and a sidebar written by Plato, the deceased philosopher. (Turns out, it was just &lt;a href="http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/home/regularieninhalte/world-news-ticker/world/2009/02/23/google-ocean-not-atlantis.html"&gt;the path of the boats used to collect the data&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;More likely? It’s a hoax propagated by a poor family looking to make a quick profit by selling a cheap parlor trick to a laughably gullible journalist.&lt;/p&gt;

They say that it looks like the fairing, the clamshell surrounding the satellite at the top of the rocket, on the Taurus XL rocket failed to separate. &lt;del&gt;So it’s in orbit, but &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/oco/main/index.html"&gt;the satellite&lt;/a&gt; is still inside the fairing, rendering it useless.&lt;/del&gt; It never made orbit, and came down in the ocean near Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA has organized a Mishap Investigation Board and they are looking into it. The rocket is built by &lt;a href="http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app3/taurus.html"&gt;Orbital Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll have more info as it develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update (10:00 Mountain time): As noted in the comments below, &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/090224-oco-launch-failure.html"&gt;space.com is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the satellite and fairing dropped into the ocean near Antarctica. I have not heard the official word from NASA yet, but if true then my statement above about the satellite reaching orbit is incorrect.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235489002768"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4051">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8c8afdc5dae1d04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="contest"/><category term="motto"/><title type="html">The New Six-Word Motto for the U.S. Is …</title><published>2009-02-24T15:04:04Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T15:04:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/ifo79NtipWk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/the-new-six-word-motto-for-the-us-is/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">You submitted your mottoes, more than 300 strong.

&lt;p&gt;This is a photograph of &lt;i&gt;Macropinna microstoma&lt;/i&gt;, also called &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/news_animal/2009/02/see-a-fish-with-a-transparent-head.html"&gt;barreleyes&lt;/a&gt;. It has a very peculiar optical arrangement. When you first look at this photo, you may think the two small ovals above and behind its mouth are the eyes, and that it looks rather sad…wrong. Those are its nostrils. The eyes are actually the two strange fluorescent green objects that look like they are imbedded in its transparent, dome-like head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/macropinna_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/macropinna.jpeg" width="425" height="307" alt="macropinna.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Video frame-grab of &lt;i&gt;Macropinna microstoma&lt;/i&gt; at a depth of 744 m, showing the intact, transparent shield that covers the top of the head. The green spheres are the eye lenses, each sitting atop a silvery tube. Visible on the right eye, just below the lens on the forward part of the tube, is the external expression of a retinal diverticulum. The pigmented patches above and behind the mouth are olfactory capsules. High-definition video frame grabs of Macropinna microstoma in situ are posted on the web at: &lt;a href="http://www.mbari.org/midwater/macropinna"&gt;http://www.mbari.org/midwater/macropinna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets the name &amp;quot;barreleyes&amp;quot; because it&amp;#39;s are cylindrical, rather than spherical; this is an adaptation for better light collection in the dim depths where it lives, using very large lenses but not building a giant spherical eye to compensate. It&amp;#39;s ore like a telescope than a wide-angle camera. Here&amp;#39;s what a single eye in a side view looks like — the lens (L) is what is glowing so greenly in the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/eye_diag.jpeg" width="425" height="409" alt="eye_diag.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chapman's (1942) mesial view of the left eye of &lt;i&gt;Macropinna microstoma&lt;/i&gt;. Abbreviations: RS = rectus superior, L =lens, OS = obliquus superior, OI = obliquus inferior, RIN = rectus internus, RI = rectus inferior, RE = rectus externus, OP = optic nerve.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that weren't weird enough, the animal has a completely transparent skull cap, and the eyes swivel about within the skull to look out through that translucent cranium. In the two pictures below, the animal is first looking straight up through its head (the eyes are in the same orientation as in the diagram above), and in the right frame it has rotated the binocular-shaped eyes forward to look ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/macropinna_side.jpeg" width="425" height="285" alt="macropinna_side.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lateral views of the head of a living specimen of &lt;i&gt;Macropinna microstoma&lt;/i&gt;, in a shipboard laboratory aquarium: (A) with the tubular eyes directed dorsally; (B) with the eyes directed rostrally. The apparent differences in lip pigmentation between (A) and (B) are because they were photographed at slightly different angles. (A) was shot from a more dorsal perspective and it shows the lenses of both eyes; the mouth is not sharply in focus. (B) shows only the right eye, with the lips in sharper focus.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature is always coming up with something stranger than we would imagine, and &lt;i&gt;Macropinna&lt;/i&gt; is a perfect example. Apparently, the function of this arrangement is to give the animal a sensitive light detector for tracking its prey, bioluminescent jellyfish, and at the same time to shield the eyes from the stinging tentacles of the jelly while it's eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

The serial is up to its &lt;a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/mcintyre/blog/2009/02/the_fat_man_chuckles.html"&gt;third installment&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Fat Man is introduced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d known him for years. We’d been honor students together — teacher’s pets — and then he started his slide. It began innocently enough, with a little amateur lexicography. But then he fell in with that hard set at Language Log. He was pals with both the Geoffs — Pullum and Nunberg — Arnold Zwicky, the lot. Before you could say &lt;em&gt;lexeme&lt;/em&gt;, he was too deep into descriptivism to ever come back. But, maybe because of our old school ties, we had always managed a gingerly balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's Skiing Break, and because of preparations for our recent move my wife and I never got round to booking accommodations up north as we often have in recent years. This week, instead we take turns with the old folks at minding the children while they're on break. Yesterday, having been &lt;a href="http://tingotankar.blogspot.com/2009/02/lek-och-larande.html"&gt;tipped off by Åsa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Ting &amp;amp; Tankar&lt;/i&gt;, my wife took our daughter to the &lt;a href="http://www.nordiskamuseet.se"&gt;Museum of Nordic Culture&lt;/a&gt; where she had a blast in the kids' room. Today, she wanted me to take her to &lt;a href="http://andyslekland.se/"&gt;Andy's&lt;/a&gt; over at the old Sickla industrial estate that's been turned into a suburban shopping Mecca. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bad feeling about this place. I mean, it's on the third floor of a &lt;i&gt;mall&lt;/i&gt; (shudder), and you take your kids there and pay to let them play while you sit around waiting? Sounded... sad and McDonaldsy and culturally deprived. But it's won me over completely. Get this: it's a huge cavernous fun house with slides and ball ponds where your kid entertains herself for hours on end while you partake of free wifi and a reasonable coffee shop. I brought a book and the family laptop and earplugs, and I have been working, undisturbed. Now and then the 5-y-o shows up sweaty and breathless and rosy-cheeked, drinks some water and zips off again to her newfound friends. This place is open from 10 to 20 on weekdays. Admission is SEK 120 ($14) a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the children skiing is of course a far better way to bond with them, but honestly, it'll be years before the little one can appreciate slopes and lifts and northern climes anywhere near as much as she enjoys the playland right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/with_juniorette_at_the_playlan.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/7ELD_SibhPc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235485869096"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_608.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1bf3b023e1e048f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-24T13:37:01Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T13:37:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/PgEdnYBNeAM/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_608.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_608.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_608.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_608.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/PgEdnYBNeAM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235485819973"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1176">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/80792d67521c4756</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Precious linguistic ignorance</title><published>2009-02-24T14:28:59Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T14:28:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1176" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know, I don't feel so good today (streaming cold, much work to do, no energy, and a foreign trip coming up on Thursday), but the extraordinarily stupid &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1173"&gt;re-subtitled war film video snippet Mark just posted&lt;/a&gt;, featuring Hitler going into a wild tirade over having his grammar corrected, made me laugh out loud. Thank you, Mark.  It was perfect for me, because (I have to admit this) I mostly don't understand spoken German at speed, especially when shouted in an apoplectic fury.  Having a good passive knowledge of spoken German would kill it stone dead, I would guess. My ignorance made it absolute bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I have reflected on the value of linguistic ignorance.  I happen to love the music of the Gipsy Kings, but one day I realized to my horror that instead of just responding to the fire of the music, I was actually beginning to understand the vapid words of one of the songs (&amp;quot;I want to go back to the mountains where I was born…&amp;quot;). Since then I have tried really hard to avoid listening to the words.  I want it to be strange, fiery music, with spectacular guitar work, and words I cannot understand at all.  Words expressing emotions I can only imagine.  But I have found Spanish rather easy to begin to comprehend, so I have to be really careful to preserve my inability to follow along with the lyrics.

There is &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1149743/Picture-100ft-long-snake-sparks-fears-mythical-monster-Borneo.html"&gt;a picture going around&lt;/a&gt; that purports to show a 100ft. snake swimming &lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/borneosnake.jpg" align="right" vspace="3" width="232" height="231" hspace="3"&gt;through a river in Borneo. The picture was allegedly taken by from a helicopter by a disaster team monitoring flood conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is certainly provocative - but as I pointed out yesterday, before we start hypothesizing about what the picture may be we first have to confirm that it is real. Pictures are no longer acceptable as evidence at face-value. The so-called Atlantis picture from yesterday was likely an innocent artifact. This picture is unlikely to be an artifact, but it can easily be fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that the marketers at Adobe are thrilled that their brand name photo-manipulation software, Photoshop, has become the generic term for using such software to alter images.  So before we knock ourselves out trying to figure out what physical phenomenon may be in the picture we first have to confirm that it was not “photoshopped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the picture zoomed in, and nothing is obvious to me, but that is a minor point as I don’t think I would be able to detect a good photoshop job. The original digital photo (I am assuming it was originally digital - if on film then better still) would need to be examined. The metadata might indicate if it had been altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press is immediately linking the notion of a giant snake to recent reports of the discovery of Titanoboa - an extinct giant boa from South America 60 million years ago. This beast was about 45 ft long and could snack on alligators. Scientists speculate that the warmer climate allowed for the boa to become larger than extant boas, which max out at about 30 ft. The largest snake on record was a python 33ft long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up an important point about plausibility. If a warmer climate was necessary to allow for a 45ft snake, then how can a 100ft snake be living today? Perhaps this is a warm-blooded snake, but that would be quite amazing. There is also the problem of a 100ft snake escaping detection for all this time. This is a point that comes up regarding any cryptozoological claim for a large yet undiscovered animal not living in deep ocean trenches or otherwise remote location. An undiscovered fish on the sea floor, or a small lizard in pristine forest - sure. But a large primate living in Pennsylvania - no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borneo does have remote dense jungle, and there are likely many undiscovered species there, but a 100 ft snake stretches plausibility a bit too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giant snake of Borneo, dubbed Nabau by locals, is likely to join Nessie and Bigfoot in the halls of unconfirmed crytozoological speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For discussion of the background of this particular misrule (the grammatical one), see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004454.html"&gt;Hot Dryden-on-Jonson action&lt;/a&gt;", 5/1/2007, with some additional syntactic background &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000743.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But please don&amp;#39;t cite the alleged Churchill quote about &amp;quot;arrant nonsense up with which I will not put&amp;quot; — it&amp;#39;s syntactically bogus (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001702.html"&gt;A Churchill story up with which I will no longer put&lt;/a&gt;", 12/8/2004), and not original to Churchill ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002670.html"&gt;Churchill vs. editorial nonsense&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;

But if you can think of a new joke about clause-final prepositions, that would be much better — I&amp;#39;m impressed that the creator of this video managed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation is welcome about whether there's a German counterpart to the English prohibition of clause-final prepositions, or indeed any &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002626.html"&gt;German equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to the whole English &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002625.html"&gt;culture of Word Rage&lt;/a&gt;.

I lied. Well, not really. At that time I really did mean it. But then I came across something that I just couldn't leave alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog know my opinion of Andrew Wakefield, namely that he is a fraud, a quack, a charlatan, and a danger to the health of autistic children and public health in general. There is, as documented in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, abundant evidence to support my opinion. But apparently there are some who don't think the way I do. Apparently to some, the revelations of his research fraud notwithstanding, Andrew Wakefield remains a hero.

No matter how many &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety"&gt;new studies&lt;/a&gt;, or the recent &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vaccines_and_autism_a_matter_of_the_heart"&gt;court decisions&lt;/a&gt; regarding three families seeking compensation from the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; (NVICP), doubt, suspicion, and disbelief still run rampant about vaccines and how "safe" they are: Whatever a growing body of scientific evidence says, the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vaccines_and_autism_a_matter_of_the_heart"&gt;emotions rule&lt;/a&gt; when parents are considering the health of their children and of their young children, at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/185986/page/1"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; comes close to accessing what is fueling fears of a vaccine-autism link. The article is by three scientists who note that, while the "mainstream media applauded the U.S. federal 'vaccine court' 's decision," so much "damage" has been done to public faith in vaccines that scientists, public health agencies, and many more have their work cut out for them. All the science in the world is not, from the looks of it, going to restore parents' confidence in vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the current distrust of government, development and accountability for the plan deserves serious, transparent input, not just by scientists but also by more than token participation of the public. It is that public whose trust has been eroded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As parents, grandparents and health professionals, we know how immunization has revolutionized child health. But to maintain that progress, we must restore public trust in vaccinations. Ignoring public anxiety about childhood vaccines—and the increase in parents who skip or stretch out immunizations—risks even more serious outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. We need visible leadership from the incoming secretary of HHS, supported by President Obama. The new public-health team must describe clearly the known benefits and risks of vaccines—and take into account safety issues as perceived by the public and scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that it's "public anxiety" that is not being addressed. Scientific studies are not, it seems, the answer to acknowledging or assuaging that anxiety, that fear about something that parents and, indeed, the public, hold most precious: the health and, therefore, the future, of our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where I think the discussion needs to shift from science (though, of course, science will always remain a crucial aspect of any discussion of vaccines). I think we need rather to consider what we're so scared about, to the point that there's been so much worry and fervor and even panic about vaccines causing autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have started to talk about a child having measles as preferable to a child having autism and so much energy is being directed to explaining about thimerosal and flu vaccines, all while the &lt;a href="http://www.reporterherald.com/news_story.asp?ID=21722"&gt;Supreme Court is making judgments&lt;/a&gt; about what is, it says (but is it?), an "appropriate" education for a child on the autism spectrum, and when everyone knows there isn't enough of anything (housing, jobs, funds) for adults on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What amorphous threat to our children do we fear? Why is "autism" one of the forms that "threat" is taking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps herein lies the heart of the issue: Something has happened that has indeed eroded national confidence in public health officials, in government, as truly having the best interests of our children (our nation's future) in mind. Now it often seems that warring sides ("traditional" vs. "alternative/biomedical" practitioners) seek to win over parents and the public with claims of certainty and safety, and seek also to instill confidence that children will be taken care of, not "harmed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that can be done to re-establish this lost confidence is to more consistently offer an honest and a hopeful view of autism, so that autism is not thought equivalent to "dreadful scourge stealing away our children." Autism is so often depicted as the dread epidemic that parents had better protect their young children from, before, like the boogie man, it snatches them away to a life of minimal communication, special education, and lifelong services. These are parts of Jim's and my life, but so is a certain boy, tall (and, yes, healthy; growing like the proverbial weed) and trying to find his own way in the world. And I want to show this boy, my son, how to make his way in this world with faith in himself and faith that the world won't turn on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that's a task of gargantuan proportions and we'd better get to it. Since we're talking about belief here, rather than constantly referring to study after study and poking holes and holes in others, I say we need to nurture belief and self-confidence in, yes, our children, tomorrow's future----a future that includes all children growing up to be adults, whatever their diagnoses, and with their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it a victory for campaigners, or just the end of the Blair/Bush era? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian carries a nice article by Anthea Lipsett, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/24/homeopathy-science"&gt;The  Opposite of Science&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Guardian-Lipsett-240209.pdf"&gt;download pdf of print version&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Guardian-lipsett-ernst-pic-240209.jpg" width="494" height="400"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Peter Davies, dean of Westminster’s school of integrated health, says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“he welcomes the debate but it isn’t as open as he would like.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Well you can say that again.  The University of Westminster has refused to send me anything much, and has used flimsy excuses to avoid complying with  the Freedom of Information Act. Nevertheless a great deal has leaked out. Not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts  emit hig Yin energy&lt;/a&gt;, but a whole lot more (watch this space).  Given what is already in the public, arena, how can they possibly say things like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Those teaching the courses insist they are academically rigorous and scientific.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another remark from an unlikely source that I can agree with too.  &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=131"&gt;George  Lewith,&lt;/a&gt;  of Southampton University and Upper Harley Street, is quoted as saying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The quality of degrees is an open joke . . . ”
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever next?  [Note: Lewith told me later that he was quoted out of context by the Guardian, so it seems that after all he is happy with the courses.  So sadly I have to withdraw the credit that I was giving him].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article emphasises nicely the view that universities that run BSc degrees in things that are fundamentally the opposite of science are deceiving young  people and corrupting science itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=984#wmin"&gt;Professor Petts of Westminster &lt;/a&gt;seems to think that the problem can be solved by putting more science into the courses   The rest of the world realises that as soon as you apply science to homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke,  I fear that Professor Petts will have to do better, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Guardian-lipsett-dc-240209s.jpg" width="483" height="503"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; ”He [DC] believes the climate is starting to change after the Bush/Blair era where people believed in things because they wished they were true. “This has been going on for a generation and it’s about time for a swing in the other direction,” he suggests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one can always hope.&lt;/p&gt;

The econ crowd argues that an effective stimulus should be both fast acting and temporary.  Common sense also dictates that the spending should be something that will eventually either reduce spending in the future, or grow the GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s much speculation that some fraction of the NSF and NIH spending will go towards funding recent proposals that were very highly ranked, but fell just below the funding cutoff.  Given how ridiculously oversubscribed the individual investigator grant programs are, there will be no lack of worthwhile projects to fund.  On the other hand, these types of grants are not necessarily fast acting.  Notifications take a while to process, and by the time the funding becomes secure, job “season” for academics would be well over, causing a significant delay before personnel could be hired and money spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think there is a pretty obvious use for some of the money that better targets the goals of the stimulus package — fund postdocs directly.  In astronomy, there are a number of high prestige fellowships that are awarded to postdocs through the NSF or NASA.  These awards offer postdocs complete freedom to direct their own research programs, a high degree of flexibility as to where they go, and a modest budget to support their research.  Thus, instead of spending 2-3 years performing labor for a senior PI, the postdocs can develop new lines of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of benefit to this idea, and not too many drawbacks:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, postdocs are typically at a very productive stage of their careers.  They’ve learned tons of useful tricks in grad school, but are not yet bogged down by teaching, grant writing, and sitting on endless committees.  Scientifically, postdocs are a lot of science bang for the buck.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, of all of us on the science track, postdocs are possibly getting slammed the hardest.  Faculty searches are getting cancelled left and right, so we have an academic generation of highly trained scientists with nowhere to go.  In the past, many of these people have successfully transitioned into industry (thus moving the benefits of past investment in their training back into the private sector), but these days that’s not much of an option either.  Giving the most promising of these folks a way to tread water for a few years might keep more of them in the scientific pipeline long enough to transfer into a stable position which made use of their skills.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; postdoctoral fellowships allow one to develop skills that one needs to make a longer term scientific career work — namely, the ability to choose your own scientific questions and then plan and execute your approach.  Instead, if the stimulus package gets funneled to postdocs solely through PI grants, then a significant fraction of postdocs are primarily going to learn additional skills in “doing what their advisor suggested”.  (While ideally there’s mentoring to support grant-supported postdocs, that doesn’t always occur.)  Moreover, the PI has a responsibility to the granting agency to deliver the products supported by the original grant, and cannot &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt; support the postdoc working on topics that are unrelated, no matter how cool and clever they are.  Developing one’s scientific judgement, and prioritizing one’s effort are skills that transcend the particular needs of academic science — thus, even if these postdocs do not eventually wind up on an academic track, the skills they acquire during a truly independent phase would be of huge benefit in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the postdoc applications are ready to go.  Committees have met and made prioritized lists for this most recent round of awards, and my past experience suggests that they could probably double the number of awards before having any substantive concern that the money was going to someone who was not yet ready for full scientific independence.  The money could then be out there stimulating those postdocs by the fall, but would be over in 3 years — fast acting and temporary, just like it’s supposed to be.  If more stimulus is needed next year, they can just increase the number of awards a second time (preferably opening it up to people who are more than three years past their PhD, which is a current limitation on some of the programs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drawbacks I can see are (1) that it takes money out of the hands of PI’s who have a proven track record of making smart scientific judgements and (2) that it adds to the overpopulation of postdocs compared to faculty positions.  With regard to the first, there is nothing that says that PI’s can’t lure these independent postdocs to their project (especially if the agencies keep rules in place to keep all the postdocs from bunching up at one or two particularly attractive institutions).  If you are doing interesting things, and have a good record for mentoring, some of these people will be more than happy to collaborate with you.  Moreover, in many fields postdocs need access to infrastructure that only PIs have (lab space, big fancy science toys, large data sets, etc), in which case the postdocs would be likely to affiliate themselves closely with PIs anyways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the second concern, I’m not quite sure where I come down on the issue.  I’ve always thought it was a mistake for people to see a tenure-track faculty position as the only acceptable outcome of PhD level training, and by giving people scientific independence at an early stage of their career, you’re offering them a chance to develop skills they’d need for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; they’d do in the future.  These people are stuck in a holding pattern anyways, and it makes more sense to me to let them do their best work while they’re looking for a place to land.&lt;/p&gt;

I was particularly struck by one of the essays in that book: “Healing but not Curing” by Bruce Charlton, MD, a reader in evolutionary psychiatry at the Department of Psychology of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlton proposes a new way of looking at CAM. He describes three common attitudes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; CAM does good and should be integrated with orthodox medicine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAM is worthless and should be discarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; CAM may or may not do good and this should be decided using science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He rejects all three. In his view,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Alternative therapies do good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; From a strictly medical perspective they are worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They should not be integrated with orthodox medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Because they are explained non-scientifically, they cannot be evaluated using the criteria of medical science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggests that alternative therapies be regarded as spiritual practices. They are about making people feel better (‘healing’) not about mending their dysfunctional brains and bodies (‘curing’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This struck a chord with me. I remember watching a TV documentary on the Brazilian healer John of God. They interviewed a woman who had rejected conventional treatment for breast cancer and was dying of that cancer but who considered John of God’s treatments a success because she felt better psychologically and was more accepting of her fate. She was not cured; she was dying. But she felt she was “healed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture is based on mythical meridians, chiropractic on a mythical subluxation, and homeopathy on magical thinking. They are among the most successful and professionalized of alternative therapies. The basis of lesser methods like crystal healing and aromatherapy are even more imaginative and less scientific. These methods all remain popular despite the fact that after decades or even centuries of experience “there is not one clear-cut instance in which any alternative therapy is unequivocally effective and indicated for any particular disease or symptom.” CAM clearly constitutes a different, nonscientific universe of discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAM is far more compatible with New Age spirituality, which “focuses on&lt;br&gt;
subjective psychological states such as integration, authenticity and self-expression.” Old spirituality was the province of organized religion and churches; this new spirituality “consists of individuals pursuing their own spiritual goals in their own way.” In New Age healing, “…what matters is the subjective ‘meaning’ to the individual – the self-evaluated effects it has on a person’s sense of well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cancer is cured by surgery or chemotherapy, the patient is better off in the long run but feels worse in the short run from the effects of the operation or the drugs. When pneumonia is cured by antibiotics, the patient usually feels better; but even if he doesn’t, the cure is worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…orthodox medicine must cure, and should aim to heal – but it does not need to heal; while alternative therapies do not cure – so they must heal in order to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concepts like meridians serve as myths, poetic symbols that have personal meaning. When CAM talks about “energy” it refers to a positive subjective sense of vitality and harmony that has nothing to do with the definition of energy in physics. Patients find concepts that have intuitive validity for them. It’s a matter of “what works for me” – individual experience is the ultimate authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When science is talking about demonstrating facts and treating disease and CAM is talking about reaching subjective personal and spiritual goals, there can’t even be any meaningful communication. It is misguided for CAM to seek validation through scientific studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative medicine will survive and grow most effectively by dropping its scientific pretensions and becoming candidly mythic, poetic, fictive, symbolic, metaphorical and fantasy-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…randomized trials of New Age therapies are as inappropriate as randomized trials of prayer or the enjoyment of Mozart – such investigations will inevitably be inconclusive, confusing and irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…so long as the therapy does no significant harm, intuitive benefit is the beginning and end of evaluation in alternative medicine…alternative therapies are neither medical nor scientific, but they should be respected as a potential contribution to modern spiritual well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlton envisions a future where both scientific medicine and CAM thrive, but separately. I find it difficult to imagine how this could come about. CAM recognizes that science matters, and it will not willingly give up its scientific pretensions. And I don’t envision the average patient having the judgment to decide when to see an MD and when to see a CAM therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think his proposal is practical, but I do think he has hit the nail on the head about the meaning of “healing” and its role in explaining the attraction of CAM. Pain is not the same as suffering. Curing is not the same as healing. It behooves us to keep this constantly in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Because more and more military operations are being outsourced to machines, &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/02/laws-of-robotic-killers.html"&gt;the Office of Naval Research have been assigned the duty of drafting an advisory report on how to deal with robotic soldiers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this brings to mind Isaac Asimov’s classic three laws of robotics: protect people, obey orders, protect yourself. Sounds good at first. But there’s a problem. How can you program robotic soldiers to protect human life if they’re their very purpose is to kill enemy combatants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ONR suggests implementing a “warrior code” in all future military robots. Basically, we need to program our ‘bots with some form of ethics in order to prevent a Terminator-style uprising, but we can’t tell them not to hurt anyone. It’s a tricky challenge. And even trickier are the human-side ethics issues surrounding robot soldiers. If, for example, one of them goes rogue and starts killing civilians, who’s to blame: the robot, the programmers, or the military leaders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Sci-Fi has taught us anything it’s that programming them to simply follow orders and say “By your command” is not the best plan.&lt;/p&gt;

So I grabbed my binoculars and took a look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! It’s &lt;em&gt;huge!&lt;/em&gt; I estimate its size through my 15×70 binoculars at about 1/3 - 1/2 a degree, or roughly the size of the full Moon on the sky. It’s pretty bright, though it’s so spread out it’s probably very difficult to see naked eye except from dark sites (though I may be off there; I was only seeing 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; magnitude stars due to light pollution and clouds). The tail was not obvious exactly, but I could see this wasn’t just a ball; it was elongated in an east/west direction. Also, the comet’s green color was pretty obvious. It’s an eerie faint green, like a planetary nebula (for those of you who have seen them through telescopes). In fact, they’re both green for roughly the same reason: nebulae are green due to fluorescing oxygen, and the comet from fluorescing molecules of carbon and CN (a radical that may come from hydrogen cyanide that is broken down by UV sunlight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my location and time (Boulder Colorado at 11:00 p.m. local time) it was &amp;quot;below and to the right&amp;quot; of Saturn. Your mileage may vary with your own location and time, and especially date as the comet is zipping along right now. Check &lt;a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/35992534.html"&gt;Sky and Telescope&lt;/a&gt; for updates on its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very spectacular sight, and one that I think will photograph well.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The term "Categorical Perception" (CP) names people's propensity to make finer discriminations at the boundaries between categories than at their interiors. It is well established that differences between languages in the  boundaries of color terms induce corresponding differences in categorical perception in their speakers.  For example, if a language A , like Greek or Russian, makes a simple lexical distinction between light blue and dark blue and language B, like English or Japanese, does not, speakers of A will reliably make finer discriminations at the boundary between light and dark blue than at the interiors of these categories and speakers of language B will not do this. There has been quite a bit of research on this question, some of it discussed in this forum: &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002743.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002763.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004108.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; all this research points to the conclusion that color naming differences across languages induce predictable differences in categorical perception of color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A debated issue, however, concerns whether the word &amp;quot;perception&amp;quot; in the expression &amp;quot;categorical perception&amp;quot; is being used with sufficient precision.  Are the observed effects truly perceptual or do they reflect a level of psychological — i.e., neural — processing that is either response-related or otherwise post-perceptual?  Specialists in visual psychophysics and physiology (areas I am not expert in) are careful not to use the word &amp;quot;perception&amp;quot; loosely. However, consensus on a bright line criterion separating perception &lt;em&gt;senso strictu&lt;/em&gt; from everything that take place in our brains downstream from perception does not, so far as I can tell, yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting new research both proposes a reasonable criterion for marking off perception &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; from post-perceptual processing and demonstrates that language-induced (i.e., Whorfian) color CP is, by this strict criterion, perceptual.  According to Thierry, Athanasopulous, Wiggett, Dering, &amp;amp; Kuipers, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.0811155106"&gt;Unconscious effects of language-specific terminology on preattentive color perception&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;PNAS &lt;/em&gt;(in press, 2009), neural activity is perceptual if it's both unconscious and pre-attentive. (I think some earlier color CP research can be argued to also meet this criterion, but that's a judgment call and this is a side issue, which doesn't detract in any way from the interest of the new stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note by Mark Liberman:The link is not yet live, although the paper was released from embargo on 2/16/2009, according to a note from editorial staff at PNAS; so until PNAS gets around to putting the paper on their site, a copy is &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/thierry.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. A delay of up to ten days between the end of the embargo and "Early Edition" access is a &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004745.html"&gt;typical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005207.html"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; for PNAS, though the reason is unclear.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thierry et al. use an event-related potential (ERP) procedure, in which the subject is hooked up to an EEG recording device and the reaction of the brain's electrical activity is monitored while he or she is exposed to a series of stimuli.  The series consists of repetitions of a "standard" stimulus, occasionally interrupted by a different, "deviant" stimulus.  The brain has a characteristic way of reacting to a novel stimulus (of any kind), and according to Thierry et al. this reaction pattern is both unconscious and pre-attentive: unconscious because subjects are unaware of it and pre-attentive because in such experiments the subjects are instructed to react to some aspect of the stimulus unrelated to the property being monitored and the brain activity of the trials which elicit a response are not included in the analysis.  For example, in this experiment the subjects were shown mostly colored circles with an occasional colored square and instructed to react when the stimulus was square.  However, the brain wave patterns were analyzed only for constancy or deviance &lt;em&gt;in the color of the circles&lt;/em&gt;, not the shape of the stimulus, which was the focus of attention. That part is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were speakers of either English, which makes no basic color term distinction between light and dark blue, or of Greek, which does: &lt;em&gt;ghalazio&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ble&lt;/em&gt;, respectively.  Subjects of both groups were tested in four blocks of trials. The researchers &amp;quot;instructed the participants to press a button when and only when they saw a square shape (target, probability 20%) within a regularly paced stream of circles [of the same hue] (probability 80%). Within one block the most frequent stimulus was a light or dark circle (standard, probability 70%) and the remaining stimuli were circles [of the same hue] with a contrasting luminance (deviant, probability 10%), i.e., dark if the standard was light or vice versa.&amp;quot; That is, there were trials of the types &amp;lt;standard: light blue, deviant: dark blue&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;standard: dark blue, deviant: light blue&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;standard: light green, deviant: dark green&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;standard: dark green, deviant: light green&amp;gt;, as shown in Figure 1 from their paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ThierryFig1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trial type was cross-categorized with speaker type into four groups of trials, Greek-blue, English-blue, Greek-green, English-green.  The standard novelty reaction ("visual mis-match negativity" or vMMN) occurs in the neighborhood of 200 milliseconds. This decrease in electrical potential was found to be significantly greater in the Greek-blue set of trials than in any of the other three sets, which were among themselves statistically indistinguishable, as shown in their Figure 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ThierryFig2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the interpretation of the figure doesn't immediately leap out at the viewer, so here's part of the authors' statistical explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Cricitally, we found no overall main effect of color (P &amp;gt; 0.1) or participant group (P &amp;gt; 0.1) and no significant color by group interaction on the mean amplitude of the vMMN but, as predicted, a significant, triple interaction between participant group, color, and deviancy (F[1, 38= = 4.8, P &amp;lt; 0.05; Fig. 2B). Post hoc tests confirmed that this interaction was generated by a  differential vMMN response pattern in Greek and English participants,  such that the vMMN effect was numerically (but not significantly greater  for green than blue deviants in the English participants (F[1,38]=0.9, P  &amp;gt; 0.1) but significantly greater for blue than green deviants in Greek  participants (F[1, 38] = 7.1, P &amp;lt; 0.02), whereas the vMMN effect for  green deviants was of similar magnitude in both the participant groups  (F[1, 38] = 0.27, P &amp;gt; 0.1). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less technical terms: Language differences in color categories were associated with differences between their speakers in perception in the strict sense of the word (well, at least in &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; strict sense of the word). The differences (in reactions to differences between within-category and across-category colors) were not large ones, but they were statisticially significant. And they were apparently too early to be the result of assigning and comparing color names on a given trial: they must have been the result of biases introduced into the color perception system itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this finding mean in the grand scheme of things?  I think, if replicated, it suggests strongly that language difference can in fact influence perception.  But now the question turns to the relative importance of that influence. The broadest Whorfian view espoused by serious contemporary experimentalists, such as Jules Davidoff, Debi Roberson, and (sometimes) Ian Davies, holds (or held until recently) that color terminologies can vary arbitrarily across languages, constrained only by the rule that a named category cannot occupy discontinuous regions of color space.  (See, for example, Roberson, Davies &amp;amp; Davidoff 2000. Actually, their language is a bit vague on this, but here is not the place to sort out fine points of scientific rhetoric.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several independent analyses of the World Color Survey data have shown beyond any reasonable doubt that this is not the case: there are universal tendencies in color naming across all languages (See, for example, Kay &amp;amp; Regier 2003, Regier, Kay &amp;amp; Cook 2005; Lindsey &amp;amp; Brown 2006; Griffin 2006; Kuehni 2007; Webster &amp;amp; Kay 2007; Dowman 2007).  So languages may differ a lot in how they name colors, but these differences are constrained by a seeming master plan, which may have to do with our common internal representation of color space (Jameson &amp;amp; D&amp;#39;Andrade 1997, Regier, Kay &amp;amp; Khertepal 2007). A second constraint on wild Whorfianism is this: the color CP effect in speaking adults has been shown to be restricted (probably entirely, but certainly in major degree) to the right visual field, which projects to the left (language dominant) brain hemisphere (Gilbert et al. 2006, Drivonikou et al. 2007, Roberson, Pak, &amp;amp; Hanley 2008). This suggests that at every moment of perception, &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of our visual input is filtered by language, but not the other half. Concurrent verbal interference (e.g., mentally rehearsing a long number name) has been shown in both lateralized and non-lateralized color CP studies to suppress the CP effect, indicating that neural representations of the named color categories are activated online during these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks as if language may indeed influence color perception in a strict sense, but if that is true — and these results show surprisingly that it seems to be true — it does this in a way that is constrained by the facts that (1) there are cross-language commonalites in the internal representation of color and (2) that only half of our visual inputs are language-filtered.&lt;/p&gt;

Last Monday I took the train (can’t tell you how happy I am whenever I avoid flying these days) to Washington DC, for a couple of days of government work, finishing up quite late on Wednesday. The next morning I flew from DC to Vancouver (you can’t always avoid it), where on Friday I delivered the &lt;a href="http://www.physics.sfu.ca/"&gt;departmental&lt;/a&gt; colloquium at &lt;a href="http://www.sfu.ca/"&gt;Simon Fraser University&lt;/a&gt;. My friend, and former postdoc, &lt;a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~levon/"&gt;Levon Pogosian&lt;/a&gt; is a Professor there, and I spent a very stimulating couple of days discussing physics with him and his colleague &lt;a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~frolov/"&gt;Andrei Frolov&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone is always telling me how beautiful Vancouver is, but on my previous visits there has been nothing but rain and cloud, and I haven’t seen anything of the area’s natural assets. This time however, it was fifty degrees and sunny, without a cloud in the sky for the entire visit, and I was just blown away by the breathtaking scenery entirely surrounding the city. Completely gorgeous! I also managed to squeeze in a wonderful dinner with friend, UBC Professor and &lt;a href="http://diracseashore.wordpress.com/"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.physics.ubc.ca/~rozali/"&gt;Moshe Rozali&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday morning I was up bright and early to fly back to Philadelphia, arriving late on Saturday, in time for a quick dinner and sleep before &lt;a href="http://orangequark.blogspot.com/2005/04/im-firefighters-plaything.html"&gt;the firefighter&lt;/a&gt; and I had to drive up to Syracuse for some personal business that was going to take 25 minutes, but needed us to be there in person. We completed that this morning, and then I rented a car and drove immediately back to Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week like that, I’d normally think about taking a day off before driving back, but in this case that wasn’t an option because tomorrow is a big day for us here at Penn. You may recall me &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/09/22/changes-part-deux/"&gt;mentioning&lt;/a&gt; that the university was setting up a new &lt;a href="http://www.physics.upenn.edu/particlecosmo/"&gt;Center for Particle Cosmology&lt;/a&gt;. Well, tomorrow is our launch event! The first part is &lt;a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/home/news/particle_cosmology.html"&gt;a panel discussion&lt;/a&gt;, with program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Center for Particle Cosmology presents &lt;em&gt;Of Telescopes and Microscopes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Panel Discussion and Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, February 24, 2009&lt;br&gt;
4:30 – 5:30 p.m.&lt;br&gt;
Bodek Lounge, Houston Hall&lt;br&gt;
3417 Spruce Street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of the microscopically small and the unimaginably large are no longer distinct realms of inquiry. In the first of a series of events hosted by the Center for Particle Cosmology, leading experts will consider what insights modern observations might provide into phenomena such as dark matter, dark energy and the physics of the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists Include:&lt;br&gt;
Vijay Balasubramanian, Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy&lt;br&gt;
Bhuvnesh Jain, Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy&lt;br&gt;
Janna Levin, Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy (Barnard College of Columbia University) and author of A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines, winner of the 2007 PEN/Robert Bingham Fellowship for Writers&lt;br&gt;
Mark Trodden, Professor of Physics and Astronomy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderated By:&lt;br&gt;
Gino Segre, Emeritus Professor of Physics and Astronomy and author of Faust in Copenhagen: A Struggle for the Soul of Physics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction By:&lt;br&gt;
Tom Lubensky, Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by the Center for Particle Cosmology and the School of Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is then followed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guests are invited to mingle with Center faculty who will be happy to answer questions and talk about their research. As part of the reception, attendees will also enjoy multimedia presentations by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Devlin, Professor of Physics and Astronomy and a principal investigator of BLAST (the “Balloon-borne Large-Aperture Submillimeter Telescope”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Thomson, Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy and a member of the ATLAS collaboration, a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshments will be served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which we expect to go on until around 7pm. Well, we’ll see about that “leading experts” stuff, but I’m hoping it’ll be a lot of fun. And with Gino and &lt;a href="http://www.jannalevin.com/"&gt;Janna&lt;/a&gt; involved, how could it not be? After all, if Janna can &lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/73484/august-24-2006/janna-levin"&gt;handle Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt;, and Gino can &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/science/14conv.html"&gt;hold his own in &lt;em&gt;the New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they should be OK with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Philadelphia area you’re welcome to attend - you just need to &lt;a href="https://www.alumniconnections.com/olc/pub/UPN/events/UPN2220707.html"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;. This has taken up quite some time over the last two weeks, and so on Wednesday it’s back to work finishing a couple of papers that are begging for final edits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000037" title=""&gt;Wings, Horns, and Butterfly Eyespots: How Do Complex Traits Evolve?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout their evolutionary history, organisms have evolved numerous complex morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations to increase their chances of survival and reproduction. Insects have evolved wings and flight, which allowed them to better disperse [2], beetles have grown horns to fight over females [3], and moths and butterflies have decorated their wings with bright circles of colored scales to scare off predators [4]. The way that most of these and other adaptations first evolved, however, is still largely unknown. In the last two decades we have learned that novel traits appear to be built using old genes wired in novel ways [5], but it is still a mystery whether these novel traits evolve when genes are rewired de novo, one at a time, into new developmental networks, or whether clusters of pre-wired genes are co-opted into the development of the new trait. The speed of evolution of novel complex traits is likely to depend greatly on which of these two mechanisms underlies their origin. It is important, thus, to understand how novel complex traits evolve.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000038" title=""&gt;An Unbiased Scientific Record Should Be Everyone's Agenda&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A large and growing literature details the many ways by which research and the subsequent published record can be inappropriately influenced, including publication bias [1], outcome reporting bias [2], financial [3] and non-financial [4] competing interests, sponsors' control of study data and publication [5], and restrictions on access to data and materials [6]. But it can be difficult for an editor, reading a submitted manuscript, to disentangle these many influences and to understand whether the work ultimately represents valid science. Any journal has stories to tell of attempts to unduly influence the publication process--such as the author who repeatedly appeals a manuscript's rejection, claiming the reviewers are incompetent and demanding evaluation by a specific list of preferred experts, or the biotech company that refuses to publicly deposit the microarray data underlying their findings. Sometimes distortion of the scientific record may be limited in scope, relating to just one paper. But when a single company funds virtually an entire research agenda on a particular topic, there is the potential for wider and far more damaging distortion. In a detailed analysis of documentation released as part of a class-action lawsuit relating to the drug gabapentin (Neurontin), Kay Dickersin has described "...a remarkable assemblage of evidence of reporting biases that amount to outright deception of the biomedical community, and suppression of scientific truth concerning the effectiveness of Neurontin for migraine, bipolar disorders, and pain..." ([7], summarized in [8]). Here we propose five ways in which authors and editors can mitigate the effects of biased agendas on the published scientific record.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000332" title=""&gt;Social Research on Neglected Diseases of Poverty: Continuing and Emerging Themes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) exist and persist for social and economic reasons that enable the vectors and pathogens to take advantage of changes in the behavioral and physical environment. Persistent poverty at household, community, and national levels, and inequalities within and between sectors, contribute to the perpetuation and re-emergence of NTDs. Changes in production and habitat affect the physical environment, so that agricultural development, mining and forestry, rapid industrialization, and urbanization all result in changes in human uses of the environment, exposure to vectors, and vulnerability to infection. Concurrently, political instability and lack of resources limit the capacity of governments to manage environments, control disease transmission, and ensure an effective health system. Social, cultural, economic, and political factors interact and influence government capacity and individual willingness to reduce the risks of infection and transmission, and to recognize and treat disease. Understanding the dynamic interaction of diverse factors in varying contexts is a complex task, yet critical for successful health promotion, disease prevention, and disease control. Many of the research techniques and tools needed for this purpose are available in the applied social sciences. In this article we use this term broadly, and so include behavioral, population and economic social sciences, social and cultural epidemiology, and the multiple disciplines of public health, health services, and health policy and planning. These latter fields, informed by foundational social science theory and methods, include health promotion, health communication, and heath education.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004574" title=""&gt;Reduction of Dopamine Level Enhances the Attractiveness of Male Drosophila to Other Males&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dopamine is an important neuromodulator in animals and its roles in mammalian sexual behavior are extensively studied. Drosophila as a useful model system is widely used in many fields of biological studies. It has been reported that dopamine reduction can affect female receptivity in Drosophila and leave male-female courtship behavior unaffected. Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to decrease the dopamine level in dopaminergic cells in Drosophila, and investigated the consequence of this manipulation on male homosexual courtship behavior. We find that reduction of dopamine level can induce Drosophila male-male courtship behavior, and that this behavior is mainly due to the increased male attractiveness or decreased aversiveness towards other males, but not to their enhanced propensity to court other males. Chemical signal input probably plays a crucial role in the male-male courtship induced by the courtees with reduction of dopamine. Our finding provides insight into the relationship between the dopamine reduction and male-male courtship behavior, and hints dopamine level is important for controlling Drosophila courtship behavior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004587" title=""&gt;Brain Correlates of Non-Symbolic Numerosity Estimation in Low and High Mathematical Ability Children&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Previous studies have implicated several brain areas as subserving numerical approximation. Most studies have examined brain correlates of adult numerical approximation and have not considered individual differences in mathematical ability. The present study examined non-symbolic numerical approximation in two groups of 10-year-olds: Children with low and high mathematical ability. The aims of this study were to investigate the brain mechanisms associated with approximate numerosity in children and to assess whether individual differences in mathematical ability are associated with differential brain correlates during the approximation task. The results suggest that, similarly to adults, multiple and distributed brain areas are involved in approximation in children. Despite equal behavioral performance, there were differences in the brain activation patterns between low and high mathematical ability groups during the approximation task. This suggests that individual differences in mathematical ability are reflected in differential brain response during approximation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004579" title=""&gt;Localisation and Function of the Endocannabinoid System in the Human Ovary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although anandamide (AEA) had been measured in human follicular fluid and is suggested to play a role in ovarian follicle and oocyte maturity, its exact source and role in the human ovary remains unclear. Immunohistochemical examination of normal human ovaries indicated that the endocannabinoid system was present and widely expressed in the ovarian medulla and cortex with more intense cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) than CB1 immunoreactivity in the granulosa cells of primordial, primary, secondary, tertiary follicles, corpus luteum and corpus albicans. The enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acyclphosphatidylethanolamine-phospholi ​pase D (NAPE-PLD), were only found in growing secondary and tertiary follicles and corpora lutea and albicantes. The follicular fluid (FF) AEA concentrations of 260 FF samples, taken from 37 infertile women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection with embryo transfer, were correlated with ovarian follicle size (P = 0.03). Significantly higher FF AEA concentrations were also observed in mature follicles (1.43±0.04 nM; mean±SEM) compared to immature follicles (1.26±0.06 nM), P = 0.0142 and from follicles containing morphologically assessed mature oocytes (1.56±0.11 nM) compared to that containing immature oocytes (0.99±0.09 nM), P = 0.0011. ROC analysis indicated that a FF AEA level of 1.09 nM could discriminate between mature and immature oocytes with 72.2% sensitivity and 77.14% specificity, whilst plasma AEA levels and FF AEA levels on oocyte retrieval day were not significantly different (P = 0.23). These data suggest that AEA is produced in the ovary, is under hormonal control and plays a role in folliculogenesis, preovulatory follicle maturation, oocyte maturity and ovulation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When one enters the university hospital here at MRU, there are a number of skilled and qualified translators that are available to help patients that can't dialogue in English to communicate with health care staff.  They are able to sufficiently translate documents to allow a patient to provide some reasonable level of consent (my M.D. blog buddies can debate the quality of said consent).  &lt;b&gt;There is no infrastructure like this in research at most major research universities.&lt;/b&gt;  Consent forms are written in English.  Even if I could provide verbal translation for this man, it would not be ethical for him to sign a document in a language he cannot read himself and understand.  Thus, it all  more or less becomes a moot point.  Beyond that, while I am a fluent Spanish speaker, I am not a qualified medical interpreter.  I have no idea how to say "indwelling arterial catheter." &lt;a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt"&gt;Babelfish&lt;/a&gt; says it's, "catéter arterial dejado en un órgano."  I know that can't be right, but who am I to question Babelfish?.  Even if I were completely confident saying, "We are studying the physiological effect of [Dr. Isis's favorite stimulus] on vascular function" in Spanish, it's not the best use of my time as a researcher (unless one of you folks want to write me in for 10% effort, and then I will make sure I learn to say it).

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is, is there an ethical issue here at all ... ?  &lt;b&gt;The National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/info/sheet11.html"&gt;mandate the inclusion&lt;/a&gt; of minorities in human research studies. In our area, members of the major minority groups often do not speak fluent English.  However, the translation of study documents and the hiring of an interpreter to help with the consent is expensive and I have never known an investigator to include a translator in a budget when they could have a technician.&lt;/b&gt; Furthermore, if you are willing to translate a consent form into one language, what about all of the other languages that might be spoken in the area around where the study is being conducted, no matter how rare?  Indeed, most people I know make the decision that the ability to understand and communicate in English at a 6th grade level is a criteria for participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, if the ability to speak English is a criteria for participation, then we by default fail to include particular groups in research cohorts.  We're back to research cohorts being comprised of middle-aged white men.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Bold emphasis added.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks to me like there is an ethical issue here.  Plus, I think I see a scientific issue.  Together, the two kinds of issues make me think that tackling the issue of translation should be a priority for researchers (and for the agencies funding their work).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/language_barriers_and_human_su.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/language_barriers_and_human_su.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/iG3dJbXVmvI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235436053419"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/tumors_in_a_quack_human_stem_c.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0b7d7fb0a8e6aac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stem Cells"/><title type="html">Tumors in a (quack) human stem cell therapy</title><published>2009-02-23T23:45:23Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T23:45:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/jzInQZvZ8mo/tumors_in_a_quack_human_stem_c.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/tumors_in_a_quack_human_stem_c.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's almost like a bad Yakov Smirnoff joke, "In America you test therapies in animals before giving them to humans, in &lt;i&gt;Russia&lt;/i&gt;..."  All I can do is wonder, &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/stemcelltumor.html"&gt;what were they thinking&lt;/a&gt;?  Injecting stem cells into a kid's spinal fluid to correct a genetic disorder?  Are they insane?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stem cells, in particular embryonic and fetal stem cells, are useful because they represent cells that are less differentiated than the cells that are working at specific functions throughout your body.  Another result of being stem cells is that they are able to divide and proliferate without differentiating or undergoing apoptosis and as cells differentiate towards their final fate they tend to divide less and ultimately commit cellular suicide if they are signaled to begin dividing again - a protection against cancerous growth.  The downside of this is that stem cells act, in their normal state, a bit like cancerous cells.  In fact one of the assays to demonstrate the pluripotency of a cell (the ability of a stem cell to make many kinds of other tissues) is to inject them into an animal where they will make tumors called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratoma"&gt;teratomas&lt;/a&gt; which are (usually) benign growths of cells that represent endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm - the three germ layers than give rise to all tissues in the body during development.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a scientist who works with stem cells, both in culture and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; I could have told you this therapy was a &lt;i&gt;bad idea&lt;/i&gt;.  A year ago &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/03/stem_cell_injections_in_china.php"&gt;Jake explained why this was a &lt;i&gt;bad idea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  If you had described this therapy to us, we would have told you exactly what would happen based on scientific knowledge of how these cells act &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.  The therapies offered to stem cell tourists are frank quackery.  They are unproven, untested, unstudied, and unmonitored.  And to you anti-FDA libertarians out there, this is what you get when you don't have regulatory oversight of human therapies.  You get stupid quackery.  The fact that this kid's cancer was detected is probably just luck - there are likely many more people who have tried these therapies of desperation who suffered side effects, and possibly even death, but we just haven't heard about it yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethical human trials require many things.  At the very least, the therapy should have been tested extensively for safety in animals and ideally for efficacy in animal models of the disease.  The patients should be selected carefully, should have a reasonable expectation of therapeutic benefit, and after the treatment follow-up should be extensive.  Further, in the case of such a novel therapy, the bar should have been set higher before attempts in humans were made. In this case we have a child with a rare genetic neurodegenerative disorder that was experimented on without proper oversight, or a reasonable expectation that this therapy should do anything.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia_telangiectasia"&gt;Ataxia Telangiectasia&lt;/a&gt; is an autosomal recessive disorder in which every cell in the child's body lacks the appropriate gene which is involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair.  By what mechanism did they think neural stem cells would have an effect on such a disorder?  Would the cells replace the child's entire central nervous system?  Would they miraculously repair the genetic defect?  Or manage to insert themselves in just the right places to fix symptoms caused by a universal defect in the the hosts genome?  This is magical thinking, not scientific thinking, and further I believe it is grossly unethical and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of &lt;i&gt;no surprise&lt;/i&gt; that the careless injection of fetal stem cells into a child would result in tumors.  This was a mind-bogglingly stupid act.  What's worse, as we hear more about the damaging quackery being offered in countries without proper regulation and oversight of human therapy we will likely hear more stories like this one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rush to find some dramatic cure for a disease using stem cells it is likely efforts like these will damage the success of legitimate and careful studies in regenerative medicine and stem cell therapies.  Injury and deaths from careless stupid quacks using these cells will create and association in people's minds between stem cell therapies and cancer.  We know the obstacles to using these cells in humans.  The major one - immune compatibility - may have been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/reprogramming_adult_stells_to.php"&gt;solved already&lt;/a&gt;.  The major remaining obstacles towards implementation of some fairly crude stem cell therapies are going to be (1) differentiating the cells into the appropriate tissues, (2) purifying the cells so that undifferentiated cells aren't accidentally transplanted into humans, (3) preventing tumorous growth in the transplanted cells (possibly including a lethal gene to reverse the therapy if necessary), and (4) proper anatomic delivery of the cells so they perform a useful function and survive in the host.  We know what the problems are.  Careful study must include addressing each of these issues and ensuring they are resolved before shoving them into someone's spinal fluid.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quackery is not only going to prove harmful to individual human patients, but will likely harm the burgeoning field of regenerative medicine as a whole.  For the sake of the patients, and for all future patients that might benefit from well-studied therapies, this quackery must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/tumors_in_a_quack_human_stem_c.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/jzInQZvZ8mo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235435845259"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/23/fireball-meteorites-and-death-reviews/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2443ff41ec07a940</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">Fireball meteorites and Death reviews</title><published>2009-02-24T00:05:57Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T00:05:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/23/fireball-meteorites-and-death-reviews/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two quickies: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I mentioned last week that possible meteorites form the Texas fireball had been found, &lt;a href="http://www.wacotrib.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/communities/breakingnews/entries/2009/02/18/meteorite_hunters_searching_ne.html"&gt;and it appears that’s now confirmed&lt;/a&gt;.

Disclosure, telling someone you've been diagnosed with an ASD, can in some situations be a literal life saver--and may in other situations create extra problems.  Even taken just from the self-advocacy side of autism issues, disclosure is too big and too important to address suitably in a single post, so I'm going to do a short series on disclosure throughout the week.  First, disclosure in relation to discrimination protection in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week a California appeals court dismissed a &lt;a href="http://hr.blr.com/news.aspx?id=79556"&gt;disability discrimination case by an employee with an AS diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; who had been called "Rain Man" by his employer.  The article cites one of the reasons why the case was dismissed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...the fact that Smyth called Jones the nicknames didn't prove that the real motive for failing to promote Jones was because he was perceived as disabled. Specifically, at the time Jones was denied the position, neither he nor the company knew he had Asperger's...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article comes from a site geared toward employers, but I would add that there is a "what to remember" for self-advocactes as well:  If you want ADA protection from workplace discrimination, disclosure, at least to HR, is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things didn't turn out well for Jones in the story referenced above, but some people on the spectrum have been more successful in winning discrimination-related suits, for example here's &lt;a href="http://www.raggededgemagazine.com/departments/worldoblogs/000649.html"&gt;a woman who won a firing-related discrimination case&lt;/a&gt;. And here's &lt;a href="http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2008/07/workplace-bullying-costs-employer.html"&gt;a man who won a bullying-related discrimination case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADA folks have put out a pretty readable &lt;a href="http://www.ada.gov/q%26aeng02.htm"&gt;FAQ on ADA Access and Rights&lt;/a&gt; that has a whole section on employment and how get protection from employment discrimination--including who you need to disclose to and what needs to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar disclosure and protection rules apply in postsecondary education.  The Department of Education's &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/print/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html"&gt;document on postsecondary transitions&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of covering disclosure and its relationship to law including Section 504 and Title II of the ADA.  The document &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/auxaids.html"&gt;Auxiliary Aids and Services for Postsecondary Students with Disabilities&lt;/a&gt; includes even more detailed information regarding accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably other good resources out there related to disclosure and legal protections from discrimination--please share resources in the comments if you've got 'em!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235430514611"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20437508.post-4663166598560840371">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f1f586902f52fe8d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Miscellanea: Reckless</title><published>2009-02-23T21:29:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T21:29:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://wellingtongrey.blogspot.com/2009/02/miscellanea-reckless.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Grey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235430514611"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=3536">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/230caa02c1ea9d24</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Will Patrick Holford Be Calling Upon His Mailing List to Sign the New Andrew Wakefield Petition?</title><published>2009-02-23T20:53:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T20:53:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/23/will-patrick-holford-be-calling-upon-his-mailing-list-to-sign-the-new-andrew-wakefield-petition/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">In June 2007 Patrick Holford contacted his mailing list to ask them to sign a petition in support of Andrew Wakefield.

One that Jim and I have thought less appropriate for Charlie is &lt;a href="http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml"&gt;DIR/Floortime&lt;/a&gt;. "DIR" stands for  "Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based" and is based on the work of Dr. &lt;a href="http://www.stanleygreenspan.com/"&gt;Stanley Greenspan&lt;/a&gt;, Clinical Professor Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and Pediatrics at &lt;a href="http://www.gwumc.edu/"&gt;George Washington University Medical School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DIR is said to start with "child’s natural emotions and interests" and then "follow the child’s natural emotional interests (lead) and at the same time challenge the child towards greater and greater mastery of the social, emotional and intellectual capacities." Having read a couple of Dr. Greenspan's books, Jim and I felt that, while there is plenty to be said about following one's child's "lead," the techniques discussed in the books did not address Charlie's learning needs and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was interested to read about the &lt;a href="http://www.odtc-wi.com/"&gt;Oconomowoc Developmental Training Center&lt;/a&gt; in Wisconsin, in the February 21st &lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/waukesha/39866632.html"&gt;Journal-Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. The center's Innovative Care for Autism and Related Disorders (ICARE) is described as  for "kids with behavioral problems and mental disabilities that schools and families were no longer equipped to serve"; the article describes it as a "program of last resort." The center uses DIR/Floortime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kara Stevenson, the director of residential services at ICARE, said they see their goal as helping autistic kids gain as many developmental skills as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some methods suggest that kids with severe autism need to be given specific skills to do over and over until they master each one, Stevenson disagrees. Instead, her staff has adopted the philosophy of clinical psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan, who advocates treating autistic kids through individualized, developmental and relationship-based therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As common sense as (building relationships with kids) sounds, it's actually fairly innovative when it comes to autism," Stevenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12-year-old Hannah Rose started at the program having 900 tantrums a month, it's noted, and now has some 500. Also, she is able to "interact with an adult for short periods of time, and she's made more gains since her learning environment allows her to get up and walk, run around or play on the swings when she's feeling caged in and stressed." (Though, as she is non-verbal, it's not specified how it's known that Hannah feels "caged in and stressed"---perhaps these are what are intuited by teachers and staff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own son has benefited primarily from teaching based on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). While there's a tendency to see this kind of teaching, based as it in behavioral science, to be somewhat &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_the_teachers_are_robots"&gt;clinical&lt;/a&gt;, ABA has been most successful with my son precisely when he's developed, even as a sort of side-product, real relationships with his teachers; when his teachers have not seen him simply as a child with "problems" and "tantrums" and "behaviors," but as the affectionate, well-meaning, student he is.  There is an emphasis on keeping data and looking at "behaviors" in an ABA program; as a parent, I've found these helpful as looking at these help me to see what Charlie is doing and learning, without things getting so muddied by my emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

Twitter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if I could get &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/THE_REAL_SHAQ"&gt;Shaq&lt;/a&gt; to follow me, I’d hit the big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that Rove has 13,373 followers, and is himself following 13,369 feeds.  Clearly there are four Twitterers out there who really pissed him off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s.  I am a lagging indicator, so if you’re not &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; using Twitter, you are hopelessly backwards.&lt;/p&gt;

I have not yet seen it (busy busy) but I plan to soon: over the next few days it’s passing very close to the position of Saturn in the sky, making it a very easy target to spot. Take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/Lulin.jpg"&gt;a map of Lulin’s position for tonight&lt;/a&gt; courtesy Jodrell Bank. &lt;a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/highlights/35992534.html"&gt;Sky and Telescope&lt;/a&gt; also has PDF maps of the comet position for various dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its position near Saturn in Leo means it’s up practically all night right now; it rises around sunset, so look East for it (check the map links above for details). With binoculars it should be pretty easy to find; its brightness is hovering just above naked-eye visibility, so it’ll be an obvious fuzzy ball near Saturn. Just sweep around and I bet you’ll find it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for you astrophotographers, it’s a piece of cake. Just take a camera, plop it on a tripod, aim it near Saturn, and take a few-seconds-long exposure. Take as long an exposure as you can (30 seconds is usually about as far as you can push it in reasonably light-polluted skies), but it may show up in shorter shots too. Pictures are turning up everywhere (do a Google image search!), so you should try your hand at it too. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/01/venus-the-moon-and-jupiter/"&gt;I’ve taken some pretty awesome sky shots with just my wee digital camera&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really not all that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me and the new comet, of course this is the first cloudy day we’ve had in weeks, so I’ll just have to wait. Impatiently. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235420126333"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=319">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7efac9fae6957d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Alliance for Registered Homeopaths - stupid</title><published>2009-02-23T13:43:14Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T13:43:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/alliance-for-registered-homeopaths-stupid/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The Alliance for Registered Homeopaths (ARH), who I’ve blogged many times before, have come up with one of the most stupid press releases I’ve ever read in relation to researchers at Addenbrooke’s Hospital developing a fascinating peanut desensitisation programme, published in the journal Allergy, for individuals allergic to the legume.  The exceptional NHS - Behind [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gimpyblog.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=1769773&amp;amp;post=319&amp;amp;subd=gimpyblog&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>gimpy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235419377842"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6170">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16a33256c61ac71d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 2.23.09</title><published>2009-02-23T20:00:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T20:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6170" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening my husband and I were driving home from the city. I turned to him and said, “Love you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He responded with an almost robotic, “Love you, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied, “Wow, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was convincing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were driving through a construction area and he was trying to figure out where the lanes were on the road, so he was more worried about not crashing into concrete dividers or other drivers than exchanging adorable pleasantries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokingly, I told him his problem was that he didn’t love me. “Love would help you negotiate traffic.” I told him. Because, you know, love conquers all. Fortunately, he really does love me - anyone else would have pulled over and told me to walk for saying something that stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some other examples that demonstrate the ridiculousness of  the idea that “love conquers all”? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She was a major force in the field of finding near-Earth asteroids, discovering or co-discovering almost 900 asteroids in her lifetime, as well as several comets (and rediscovering one object that seems to straddle the asteroid/comet line). She was principal investigator of JPL’s &lt;a href="http://neat.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program&lt;/a&gt;, a system mounted on a 1.2 meter telescope that looks for threatening objects in space. She took this threat seriously, as should we all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about this remarkable woman &lt;a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/3806/helininterview.htm"&gt;in an interview she did in 1998 with Thinkquest&lt;/a&gt;. She’ll be missed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. More on Postsecondary Transitions: After posting about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/schools_not_over_after_you_turn_21"&gt;college programs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/us_college_programs_for_autistic_students"&gt;more college programs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_resource_for_transitioning_to_college"&gt;transition resources for self-advocates&lt;/a&gt;, I got notified that the Department of Education has released a document &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/print/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html"&gt;Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn't want to do yet another post on postsecondary transition, but the DoE guide is really quite worth a look for anyone interested in the topic.  Particularly critical is that the DoE guide includes information about legal rights and which pieces of law govern college disability services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. More on Darwin: Arizona news assistant and mother to a person on the spectrum Johanna Eubank wrote &lt;a href="http://regulus2.azstarnet.com/blogs/puzzlepieces/13466"&gt;this stunning article&lt;/a&gt; based off the Darwin story that &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/darwin_einstein_turing_and_posthumous_diagnosis"&gt;also caught my interest&lt;/a&gt;.  Eubank however took off in a totally different, and equally important-to-consider, direction: Take care not to underestimate or stifle an autistic person's potential or creativity; there is no way to tell what exceptional places an autistic person might end up if given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Art News:  An &lt;a href="http://www.medilexicon.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=139183"&gt;exhibition of poetry and visual art by people on the spectrum&lt;/a&gt; was shown in London.  For those of us (like me) who are not in London, there is an &lt;a href="http://www.think-differently.org.uk/en/campaign/Whats%20going%20on/Creativity%20Gallery.aspx"&gt;online gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. More on Art News: Keri Bowers, who co-directed &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903000/"&gt;Normal People Scare Me&lt;/a&gt; with her Aspie son Taylor Cross, is planning a new movie &lt;a href="http://lubavitch.com/news/article/2025598/The-Arts-Special-Needs-Interest-Comes-to-the-Big-Screen.html"&gt;focusing on siblings of people on the spectrum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Shameful Act of the Week Award goes to Autism Speaks for &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/feb/19/marcia-weinstein-help-available-autism"&gt;using Alex Barton&lt;/a&gt; as a tool for its own publicity and fund raising, only days after &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stopping_child_abuse_too_political_for_autism_speaks"&gt;refusing to support Melissa Barton on Alex's behalf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235414603649"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/23/how-to-crush-antivax-arguments/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d810a942fbfde49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">How to crush antivax arguments</title><published>2009-02-23T17:59:42Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T17:59:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/23/how-to-crush-antivax-arguments/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Gorski is a surgical oncologist, and also a well-known though bepseudonymed blogger for Science Blogs. His anti-antivaccination stance is legendary, for good reason: he is incredibly well-spoken and his posts railing against the pro-measles (haha) crowd routinely eviscerates them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of his posts has ever done so in such a remarkably thorough fashion &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;as in this lengthy post in which he destroys the movement from top to bottom&lt;/a&gt;. What we have there, ladies and gentlemen, is the be-all and end-all of posts about the antivaxxers, showing their lack of evidence, their ad hominem attacks, their lies, their fraud, and everything else that makes them one of the greatest health threats in the United States, if not the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the vacuous pseudoscientific nonsense of antivax spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy, to the out-and-out evillness of Andrew Wakefield, the father of the modern movement whose conflicts of interest when it comes to vaccines are simply breathtaking, Dr. Gorski’s post is nothing short of what should be The Link, the one you send to all parents who question whether they should vaccinate their children or not. Everything you need is there, with the history, quotations, false claims, and everything else about the antivax movement, including links to more information. I’ve put it in my sidebar blogroll, and if you think children should stay healthy and not get measles, rubella, pertussis, the flu, encephalitis, and even possibly die, then please help promote Dr. Gorski’s post. You may help save thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235414544299"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/23/the-cathedral-of-learning/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/300c0b2dded07cc4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><category term="Travel"/><title type="html">The Cathedral of Learning</title><published>2009-02-23T18:39:19Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T18:39:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/23/the-cathedral-of-learning/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got back from Pittsburgh, a city famous for honoring &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/01/31/go-steelers/"&gt;football players&lt;/a&gt; along with Fathers of our country.  Apparently they recently won some sort of sporting contest, so the citizens were generally in good spirits.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was visiting to &lt;a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/"&gt;Center for the Philosophy of Science&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Pittsburgh, to speak in their annual lecture series.  The Center, along with the &lt;a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~hpsdept/"&gt;Department of History and Philosophy of Science&lt;/a&gt;, help make Pittsburgh one of the world’s leading institutions for studying philosophy of science.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Center is also a remarkably &lt;a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/Being_here/last_donut/last_donut.htm"&gt;friendly place&lt;/a&gt;, and I had a great time during my visit.   The highlight, predictably, was lunch with some of the graduate students, where we got to let our hair down and talk about big ideas concerning time and causality and determinism.  (Almost all professional academics start out fascinated by big ideas, but the interest is gradually beaten out of them along the way by the demands of professionalism and career advancement.  Grad school is probably the peak combination of background knowledge and willingness to confront the hard problems.)  I also got to chat with &lt;a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~grunbaum/"&gt;Adolf Grünbaum&lt;/a&gt;, whose declamations concerning the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/08/30/why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing/"&gt;Primordial Existential Question&lt;/a&gt; had impressed me a year and a half ago.  And I got to meet some fellow bloggers in the flesh — the formidable &lt;a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/"&gt;Cosma Shalizi&lt;/a&gt;, who helped me understand how to augment the principle of indifference with conditionalizing over the past hypothesis, and &lt;a href="http://www.soulphysics.org/2009/02/soul-physics-meets-cosmic-variance.html"&gt;Bryan Roberts of Soul Physics&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the aforementioned grad students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_learning"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/250px-cathedral_of_learning_pittsburgh_by_jennifer_yang.jpg" alt="Cathedral of Learning"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But if I’m really honest, my favorite part of the trip was probably the building.  The Center for the Philosophy of Science is housed in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_learning"&gt;Cathedral of Learning&lt;/a&gt;, a looming structure on the University’s campus — the second-tallest academic building in the world, after one at Moscow State University.   Despite my lack of religious sympathies, I love cathedrals — the looming structures, swooping curves, open spaces, all designed to elicit a certain emotional response going far beyond their direct practical purpose.  (Not that different from the best casinos in Vegas, really.)  And I love learning!  So the Cathedral of Learning is pretty much the perfect building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it really does work as a building.  What everyone points to are the many Nationality Rooms scattered throughout the building — a series of 27 spaces decorated in the style of various different countries, often with the input (and financial assistance) of the respective governments, which work as display pieces but are also functioning classrooms.  (I was told that prospective students are sometimes convinced to come to Pittsburgh by a visit to the room corresponding to their personal heritage.)   But what I liked was the immense Commons Room (pictured), with impossibly high ceilings, which is just a place where people can sit down and read and talk and think.  Such places are very precious, and the world should have a lot more of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Wikipedia is to be believed, the Cathedral grew out of a vision of Chancellor John Gabbert Bowman in the 1920’s.  He insisted that the Commons Room be built on the principles of true Gothic architecture, with self-supporting arches.  When told that these things cost money, he replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You cannot build a great University with fraud in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if that’s strictly true, but it’s an honorable principle to strive towards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How do we approach this as a society?

&lt;p&gt;Item 1: Deaf people have special needs with regards to interactions with the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Item 2: The government mandates that proper interpreters be provided for doctor visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Item 3: Neither patients nor doctors can afford to provide this service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now don't go telling me that "all you rich doctors can afford to get the interpreter"---we most emphatically cannot. That is a simple fact, and if you don't believe me, then you don't. &lt;i&gt;Epur, si moeve.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a great deal of support for an expensive government mandate that would pay for interpreters for the deaf. How do we provide this critical service?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the way Pal has framed this is exactly right -- this is a question that is an ethical challenge to us &lt;b&gt;as a society&lt;/b&gt;.  Given the limits on what any of us can accomplish as individuals, what are we committed to doing collectively?  What &lt;b&gt;ought&lt;/b&gt; we commit to do collectively?  And what does this say about what goods we regard as necessities to a good life -- or about which members of society we believe are entitled to partake of this good life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/medical_interpreters_societal.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/medical_interpreters_societal.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/MDqrEGzpKj4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235411969237"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4125">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4bde525071678e07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Paphiopedilum hybrid</title><published>2009-02-23T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-24T17:08:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/papaiopedilum-h.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are some eye-popping numbers in the report released by the California Attorney General. The Bee points to the American Diabetes Association, where in California alone, commercial fundraisers generated $13,000,000 in donations at a cost of $17,000,000. That organization is an outlier, but other prominent charities had significant negative revenue using telemarketing and other commercially-operated fundraising.

&lt;p&gt;Now and then I blog about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/archaeology/tree_house_ruins/"&gt;abandoned tree houses&lt;/a&gt;. But of course, real large houses are even more fascinating in their extended boundary state between dwelling and archaeological site (as I &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/01/swedish-ruins.html"&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; in January '06).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read a new book (in Swedish) about abandoned houses: &lt;i&gt;Svenska ödehus&lt;/i&gt;, finely written by Sven Olov Karlsson and illustrated with exquisite photographs by Philip Pereira dos Reis. Every abandoned house has its story, and the two have sought them out. Highly recommended!

It certainly appeals to the imagination - wondering what an ancient yet advanced civilization might have been like. It also appeals to the little explorer in each of us. At a time when we can go on the computer in our living room and see high quality satellite images of the entire planet it may seem like there is nothing left to explore - no edge of the map beyond which there be dragons. A little mystery can be fun - perhaps there are hidden archaeological and historical treasures to be found, at the bottom of the ocean or under Antarctica, whatever your preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, Bernie Bamford, an aeronautical engineer from Chester, UK,&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/google/4731313/Google-Ocean-Has-Atlantis-been-found-off-Africa.html"&gt; claims he found an aerial map of Atlantis &lt;/a&gt;on Google Earth. What he found was what appears to be a &lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/atlantis-google.jpg" title="atlantis-google" alt="atlantis-google" align="right" height="158" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="270"&gt;grid-pattern of lines covering an area about the size of Wales about 620 miles off the coast of West Africa (here are the Google coordinates: 31 15′15.53N 24    15′30.53W.  Bamford is quoted as saying that the grid pattern “must be man-made.” Some reports characterize the pattern as “perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly perfectly straight lines and right angles are not features common in nature and they do indeed suggest a human technological origin. If you look closely at the photo you will see that the lines are not perfect - but to be fair they are close enough that the non-natural argument still holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, are the possibilities? The standard archeological approach to an aerial photo of a potential site is that on the ground (in this case on the sea floor) confirmation is always required. This is because it is very difficult to identify objects from far above. Such images are notoriously susceptible to optical illusions and pareidolia (see the Face on Mars). A legitimate archeologist will not publish that they found X until they have gone to the site and confirmed X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it is important not to jump to the sexy explanation based upon flimsy data. There is no reason to think that this grid of lines is Atlantis specifically. In fact there is no reason to think that it is anything until the nature of the data itself is examined. Before we begin speculating about what the grid pattern is we need to ask - is it real or is it an artifact of the data. For example, if one finds a blob of light on a picture, before speculating about what phenomenon is in the picture a photographic artifact must first be ruled out. Also conspiracy theorists are fond of zooming in on NASA photos of the surface of the moon or mars and then declaring that the straight lines they find must be artificial and not natural. However, they are just looking at pixelation artifact from digital photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the apparent grid pattern does not survive this first test. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7903169.stm"&gt;Google has made an official statement&lt;/a&gt; that the grid pattern is indeed an artifact of data collection. They used sonar images from boats mapping the ocean floor - boats following a grid pattern. The lines represent the paths the boats travelled while mapping and is simply an artifact in the resulting composite image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it turns out the grid pattern was man-made - it was made by the path of sonar-mapping boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many other reasons why the Atlantis hypothesis was highly unlikely. It is clear, for example, that Plato (who first wrote about Atlantis) invented Atlantis as a literary device and was not claiming that it actually existed. Atlantis was the evil empire, enemy of Athens, the shining virtuous city. Atlantis fell into the ocean due to its moral decay. This was a philosophical discourse - not an archaeology lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course efforts to find even the slightest evidence of Atlantis have completely failed. The surface of the earth is finite, and as Google Earth shows us, it has been extensively mapped and explored. The absence of evidence for Atlantis (a highly dubious notion to begin with) at this point is more than sufficient to conclude (to the extent that science can draw any tentative conclusion) that it simply does not exist. I think it is also fair to say that it would be folly to invest further resources into looking for Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google grid pattern, however, is likely to make its way permanently into Atlantis lore. Those who cling to belief in Atlantis as a real place are likely to be more compelled by their imaginations of what the grid pattern may represent than the logic and evidence that tells us it is nothing but artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

Bear with me with patience, please. Until this afternoon, when I slap these puppies and ship them off to their destinations, I'll leave you with something to discuss among yourselves: the movies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night was Oscar night, and I had the awards yammering in the background while I was pounding the keys. I have to get out more; I've seen virtually none of the nominated movies this year. There's something called "Slumdog Millionaire" that's getting a lot of buzz? Shows what I know. I hadn't even heard of it until last night. My pop culture cred just took a nosedive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the awards show, Hugh Jackman was pretty and congenial, which I guess is the role of the emcee. The format was grating: at each award, they'd have five past winners come out on the stage and slather flattery on each nominee, while the camera locked onto each one, simpering and squirming under the barrage of praise. This was not good; Hollywood already has a reputation of being the domain of the vain, and amplifying the effect with a prolonged demonstration of how happy these people are to be fawningly serviced in public had me cringing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high point, I thought, was Sean Penn's acceptance speech for best actor in which he shamed the people who don't want to see equal rights for everyone, gay or straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, Bill Maher was one of the presenters for best documentary, and what did he do? Plugged his movie, &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt;, while moaning over the fact that it was not nominated. Bad form, Bill, very bad form. Maybe it just wasn't good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did finally see &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt; a few days ago, and I confess to being a bit disappointed. It consisted of a series of short interviews with, for instance, truckers at a truck stop chapel, Catholic priests, an "ex-gay" minister, a Muslim rapper, etc., and it was all capped with excellent and scathing monologue that strongly criticized religion. Don't get me wrong, it was good, and there were some funny bits, but something nagged at me throughout, and only when I saw the conclusion did I realize what it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maher cheated. He had a clear idea of what his opinion was, but he wasn't sharing it with the people he was interviewing. They were left to flounder and make poor arguments in part because there are no good arguments for religion, but also because they were left in the dark about what they were arguing against. It may be funny, but it's no fair; contrast that with the Dawkins' documentaries on religion, which are less funny, but more honest, because the people on camera know (or should know) exactly what they are wrestling with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt; would have recorded the closing monolog first, and sent that to each of the potential interviewees with a note saying, &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s my position. Are you willing to argue against it on camera?&amp;quot; That would have made for a much more interesting movie, and Maher would have had to break a sweat to address criticisms…and it would probably be less funny. There&amp;#39;s a reason Maher wasn&amp;#39;t nominated for an Oscar, and I think it&amp;#39;s because his documentary took no risks, and didn&amp;#39;t probe very deeply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/desperate_space_filler_oscars.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/HV5yLs8pQNw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235397389787"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6454714227955701540">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03afea953668bbab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Guest Post by William Lobdell: Deconstructing Criticism</title><published>2009-02-23T12:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T16:13:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/531kUEPtfS8/guest-post-by-william-lobdell.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6454714227955701540/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6454714227955701540" title="15 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/guest-post-by-william-lobdell.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">With the launch of my book tomorrow, I’m starting to read and hear an increasing amount of criticism–something I expected with a memoir titled, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061626813?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061626813&amp;amp;adid=12QE1RB2G6KVW0CNWYWY&amp;amp;"&gt;Losing My Religion.&lt;/a&gt;  They have their opinion; I have mine. Fair enough. But I thought I’d take a stab at answering some of the most popular criticisms.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism: You’re anti-religious or anti-Christian. &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not. I miss my faith. But I can’t believe what I feel in my heart (and see with my eyes) is untrue. I believe I’ve found the truth, but have enough humility (and experience) to know I need to keep my eyes open for new information that could reshape my views. So far, in my three years as an out-of-the-closet atheist, the evidence has continued to pile up against a personal God who intervenes in my life. In the end, I’m anti-hypocrisy–especially when the hypocrites operate under the guise of God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism: You are trying to lead people away from God and/or Jesus Christ.&lt;/strong&gt; Not really. This is just my story. I’m really hoping my journey will let folks know it’s normal to wrestle with doubts and also to get people to think more about faith and its shortcomings. Some of the biggest fans of my memoir have been pastors and other reformers who think the Body of Christ has grown soft and could use the wake up call. Christianity would make a whole lot more sense to me if Christians acted like they really believed the message of the Gospel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism: You’ve confused the sinfulness of man with a perfect God.&lt;/strong&gt; This is condescending. In Christian theology, I understand the difference between God and fallen man. And I know that means Christian institutions, run by humans, won’t be perfect. But the argument falls apart on several levels. First, despite man’s fallen nature, Christian institutions should behave in a manner morally superior than their secular counterparts. I didn’t see much difference. But that not even where I lost my faith. That fact only caused me to start questioning other aspects of Christianity: why Christians behave basically the same as atheists in terms of morals and ethics; why no studies show that prayer works; why God gets credit for answered prayers and no blame to tragedies; and why the Bible is filled with a litany of bizarre punishments (death for working on the Sabbath, for one), a wrathful God who wipes out whole populations; why Christianity would be the one true faith out of the 1,000 of religions past and present; how God could be both merciful and just (the notions are contradictory); and even why Jesus didn’t speak out against slavery (in fact, he only says they should be beaten less). Eventually, my faith collapsed under the weight of all the evidence against it. I’d say as a Christian, I had mistaken a man-made creation for one developed by a loving God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism: You were never really a serious Christian, so you didn’t really lose your faith, you never had it.&lt;/strong&gt; I’d agree with half that statement. I didn’t really lose my faith in the sense that you can’t lose something that didn’t exist. But I indeed was a serious Christian for more than a dozen years. I went to church weekly. I was member of a small men’s group that studied the Bible. I went on retreats. I read the Bible daily. I prayed several times a day. I read scores of Christian books. I don’t see how anyone could argue that I didn’t take my faith seriously. I think it helps critics to paint me as a half-ass Christian because then I’m easily dismissed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism: You’re just trying to sell books.&lt;/strong&gt; I do want to sell a bzillion books, but that doesn’t change my experiences or my de-conversion journey. I also find it funny that Christians never accuse Christian authors–who make a fabulous living off their books–of “just trying to sell books.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism: You’ve consigned yourself to an eternity in hell.&lt;/strong&gt; Look, I’ve tried my hardest to hang on to my faith. I just don’t have it. If there happens to be a Christian God and, given the circumstances, he still sends me to an eternity in hell, then what kind of loving God is that? Does that make sense to anyone? What kind of person are you worshipping? More likely, if I’m wrong and there is a loving God, I imagine he would look at me and said, “Son, I know how hard you struggled to believe. I’m very proud of your effort. I love you. Let’s spend eternity together.” What would you do as a loving father?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn’t write this post to sway critics. I’m guessing they are locked into their beliefs. But I do think there are a lot of people in live in shades of gray. I at least wanted to give those people something to think about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- William Lobdell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

He may have uncovered the secret identity of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1170"&gt;Geoff Pullum's correspondent&lt;/a&gt; — but in any case, the last panel has a nice instance of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813"&gt;overnegation&lt;/a&gt;, of a kind that I don't think we've discussed before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BlondieOvernegation.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/BlondieOvernegation.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Like several other species of apparent overnegation (e.g. "fail to miss", "cannot underestimate"), this one is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22wouldn%27t+be+surprised+if+you%7CI%7Che%7Cshe%7Cthey%7Cwe+didn%27t%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;so common&lt;/a&gt; that it appears to be in some sense a valid construction. It appears in &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wear/content/articles/2009/01/23/learn_to_swim_feature.shtml"&gt;BBC features&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/article/20090218/NEWS01/902180335/1079/news01"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sunjournal.com/story/304160-3/Franklin/Town_prepares_for_tax_loss_from_paper_machine/"&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.times-herald.com/opinion/op-ed/Every-sermon-needs-one-main-point-662870"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But the seeds have been sown and I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't try, once she's feeling more confident herself, to persuade him into the deep end.&lt;br&gt;
"I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see there are a couple of days with some good news and very, very positive market news," Houge said, noting potential days of 10 percent spikes.&lt;br&gt;
"I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't lose $157,000 in taxes," Van Tuinen said.&lt;br&gt;
It was late, and I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't leave some of his audience back down the road somewhere impaled on point number 10 or 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search in Google Books verifies that it's common in popular novels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't try to make trouble, if she hasn't already, that is.&lt;br&gt;
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't let herself get pregnant on purpose to hook Kent.&lt;br&gt;
Knowing how outspoken Ella was, I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't confront Casey about her identity.&lt;br&gt;
When that broke up, her husband conveniently kicked off — I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if she didn&amp;#39;t put rat poison in his juleps — and she high-tailed it up here to grab up ol&amp;#39; Pom before somebody else did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transcripts in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bnuvCJQnS0kC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kennedy Tapes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Ernest R. May &amp;amp; Philip Zelikow, 2002) show JFK using this construction (p. 219), in discussing reactions to the anticipated confrontation at the Cuban blockade line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, there isn't any choice. I mean, you would have been, you would have been impeached.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;President Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s what I think. I would have been impeached. I think they would have moved to impeach. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they didn&amp;#39;t move to impeach right after this election, on the grounds that I said … and didn&amp;#39;t do it … and let … I mean, I&amp;#39;d be …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Suzanne Marrs' &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ANDBdnute9AC"&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt; of the great writer Eudora Welty quotes her saying about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Winter_(politician)"&gt;William Winter&lt;/a&gt; "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't prove himself to be one of the best governors in the nation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a literal interpretation, the intended meaning appears to be undermined semantically by the second negation (the one in the if-clause, which in this construction always (?) seems to be final).  And the sentence seems to have the intended meaning if the second negation is left out — for example, &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if you lost $157,000 in taxes&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if they moved to impeach right after this election.&amp;quot;  Still, this construction is clearly more than just an occasional slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be an example of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002192.html"&gt;negative concord&lt;/a&gt; in action, even if &lt;a href="http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/mEzODg0Z/ladusaw.salt2.pdf"&gt;classical negative concord&lt;/a&gt; is a within-clause phenomenon (I think). But I wouldn't be surprised if some of you didn't have other interesting theories.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235395383228"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/50a1d05809a23877</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">The beginning of a very, very bad year for antivaccinationists</title><published>2009-02-23T13:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T13:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/4wo9Sm-F1n8/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing that's become apparent to me so far in 2009 is that, while 2008 was the year of the antivaccinationist, 2009 is already shaping up to be a very bad year for antivaccinationists. A very bad year indeed, and this is a very, very good thing--if it can be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, let's take a look at last year. In 2008, Jenny McCarthy was the new and fresh celebrity face of the movement that believes that autism and all manner of other neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by vaccines and that the government and big pharma are suppressing The Truth. She had emerged in the fall of 2007 after having tried to erase from the Internet her previous involvement in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_generation_woo.php"&gt;the "Indigo Child" movement&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for becoming an "autism advocate" who could write a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Louder-Than-Words-Mothers-Journey/dp/0452289807/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1235413695&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that could land her &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_two_cra.php"&gt;on Oprah's show&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to her and, perhaps even more so to the star power of her boyfriend Jim Carrey, who is just as wrong about vaccines and medicine as Jenny is, the antivaccine movement came roaring into prominence in a way that it had never managed to pull off before. After all, let's face it, a former Playboy Playmate of the Year and a famous comedian are far more "interesting" public figures for various media outlets to interview than previous celebrities who spearheaded the vaccine manufactroversy, such as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/from_the_vaults_rfk_jr_gets_hi.php"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; or washed-up shock jock returned from the grave of his own digging &lt;a href="http://soapgun.blogspot.com/2005/06/mercury-autism-and-imus.html"&gt;Don Imus&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/deirdre_imus_gives_everyone_some_stupid.php"&gt;Deirdre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Jenny's combination of good looks, stupidity, and utter confidence in her Google University education, coupled with her obnoxiousness, led to her showing up all over the media in 2008. For example, on April 1 (no, I'm not making this up), she &lt;a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/jenny-mccarthy-and-david-kirby-on-larry.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;appeared on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=762"&gt;shouted down physicians&lt;/a&gt; who had the temerity to tell her that her Google University knowledge was just plain wrong. The pinnacle of her influence came during the summer, when, having now supplanted J.B. Handley as the public face of the antivaccine group &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; and transforming GR into "Jenny McCarthy's autism charity," she led the "&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Green Our Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;" rally in Washington, DC. True, at most there were several hundred people there, but it got wide news attention, and Jenny was all over the news. She rapidly followed it up by releasing a second book &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/ask_jenny_mccarthy_a_question.php"&gt;appearing on &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt; yet again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/4wo9Sm-F1n8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235389058768"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1170">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85b4b37adf78db93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lost in Translation"/><title type="html">A long time since we did not meet</title><published>2009-02-23T11:27:08Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T11:27:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1170" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I heard from &lt;strong&gt;cindy&lt;/strong&gt; today.  She would do well to join &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001494.html"&gt;Becky&lt;/a&gt; in going to night school in grammar.  Her message began thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Hi there! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It has been long time since we did not meet. I hope everything is okay with you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She barely needed to continue by saying she had recently &amp;quot;found a great medicine shop on the net…&amp;quot;; I could see that coming. It certainly has been a long time since we did not meet, cindy. And I hope it will be a long time before we do not meet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correspondent called MikeYankee wrote to me to suggest that French influence might be implicated here, since (he says) "French does this sort of thing with the pleonastic &lt;i&gt;ne&lt;/i&gt;.  For example: &lt;i&gt;Je crains que madame ne vienne&lt;/i&gt; = 'I'm afraid my wife will come' (not won't)."  He's quite right, this is probably very relevant.  This spamming cindy may be a speaker of French, and her native language interferes with the grammar of the language in which she spams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike adds: "Perhaps some other languages do this too; I'm not aware of any."  He's right there too.  There is plenty of evidence for this kind of concealed overnegation in the syntax of languages that we call pleonastic negation.  The existence of several such languages was the topic of the first talk I ever heard by the Dutch linguist Pieter Seuren, who visited the University of York some time around 1969.  Pieter reminded me of that talk recently when I visited him at his home not far from Nijmegen.  I was an undergraduate when I heard that talk, and he was a young linguist at Magdalen College, Oxford.  So Pieter and I have been good friends now for 40 very interesting years.  Pieter pointed out in the talk that pleonastic negation occurs in comparatives, and there's a semantic reason.  If I claim that I've known Pieter longer than you have, then there's an &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (not greater than about 14,600) such that I've known Pieter for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; days and you have &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; known Pieter for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; days.  French pops in a &lt;i&gt;ne&lt;/i&gt; as if to remind you of the implied negative claim buried in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, if it's a long time since we met, then there is a long period during which we have &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; met, so there's a trace of negativeness in there too. Some languages choose to express it overtly.&lt;/p&gt;

But given the acrimony that gets put into &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_vaccine-autism_scare_panic_in_the_wrong_place"&gt;exchanges about certain topics&lt;/a&gt;, and the many &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10_autism_controversies"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt; about autism (from what it is to what causes it to how best to treat it), perhaps it is a surprise to hear about parents or anyone "banding together" and "to gain strength."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what the parents in the &lt;a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_11761202"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; are joining forces over is.............education. Specifically, the parents of special education children in North County, California, are joining together to share resources and information about the programs and services their children receive, and to be a stronger voice of advocacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents in one school district, Scotts Valley, were something more than frustrated to learn back in November that bonuses for teachers had been funded with "reserves that had been budgeted to cover cost overruns in special education." The parents group is particularly pointing to school district administrators and how they address their requests for appropriate services and supports for their children:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our mission is to disseminate information and support parents in their quest for educating their children, and let them know they're not alone," said Susie Christensen, president and co-founder of the Santa Cruz Special Education Parent Teacher Association, which hosted its first meeting Saturday.&lt;br&gt;
.................&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is where I think the administrators will get a little nervous -- everyone finding out who said what to whom and when," she said. "We're not trying to step on toes, but we're going to."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Christensen stressed that the organization will strive to be a positive group focused on educating parents about their options, as well as raising funds for teachers struggling for resources. For instance, she said the organization will call for more designated autism classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often in Jim's and my struggle to get the right sort of school placement and educational services for our son Charlie, it's not been the teachers or anyone of the staff---anyone who actually spends time with students---who's been the source of contention. It's often been the administration, the directors of special education and superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not seeking simply to shift blame and find someone to point out. Administrators have often voiced their deep concern for special ed students needs and indicated (some more honestly than others) that their hands are tied and that budgetary constraints limit what can be done. But too often---in regard to school services and in the search to get services, from respite to information about Medicaid waivers to various programs---things get stalled, and things don't happen, because of a bureaucratic impasse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget cuts for services for individuals with disabilities are imminent all over. Indeed, they're actual in some places such as &lt;a href="http://www.wickedlocal.com/littleton/archive/x955246625/State-budget-leaves-parents-of-autistic-kids-dismayed"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; where $85 million in cuts or proposed reductions to community supports, autism programs and employment services will result in 11,000 individuals with disabilities losing support services. As Dora has noted, such budget cuts don't only affect individuals with disabilities but &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/considering_the_financial_benefits_of_dd_services_in_the_community"&gt;also those who give and provide those services&lt;/a&gt;. It's not only individuals with disabilities and their families who need to "band together" to preserve programs and services, but also the therapists, caregivers, staff, teachers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot that a lot of us have in common; a lot that a lot of us are going to have to throw all of our energies into to preserve. Would that the fervor that gets put into talking about vaccines and autism were transferred to education and services through the lifespan for individuals for disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all in this together.&lt;/p&gt;

Between one and two weeks ago, there appeared two momentous news about the manufactroversy regarding vaccines and autism. No doubt, many SBM readers were expecting that I, as the resident maven of this particular bit of pseudoscience, would have been here last week to give you, our readers, the skinny on all of this. Unfortunately, as some know, my wife’s mother died, coincidentally enough, on the 200th anniversary of Darwin’s birthday and a day when one of those two momentous bits of news was released to the public, which is why I used &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=374"&gt;one of my handful of posts&lt;/a&gt; written and then held in reserve. I’m back now, though, and I don’t think it’s too late to comment on these bits of news because now that over a week has gone by what I’ve seen has led me to draw some conclusions that I might not have been able to do, had I done my usual bit and been first off the mark (at least among SBM bloggers) discussing the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008: The Best of Years for the Antivaccine Movement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s take a look at last year. In 2008, Jenny McCarthy was the new and fresh celebrity face of the movement that believes that autism and all manner of other neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by vaccines and that the government and big pharma are suppressing The Truth. She had emerged in the fall of 2007 after having tried to erase from the Internet her previous involvement in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_generation_woo.php"&gt;the “Indigo Child” movement&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for becoming an “autism advocate” who could write a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Louder-Than-Words-Mothers-Journey/dp/0452289807/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1235413695&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that could land her &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/jenny_mccarthy_and_oprah_winfrey_two_cra.php"&gt;on Oprah’s show&lt;/a&gt;.  Thanks to her and, perhaps even more so to the star power of her boyfriend Jim Carrey, who is just as wrong about vaccines and medicine as Jenny is, the antivaccine movement came roaring into prominence in a way that it had never managed to pull off before. After all, let’s face it, a former Playboy Playmate of the Year and a famous comedian are far more “interesting” public figures for various media outlets to interview than previous celebrities who spearheaded the vaccine manufactroversy, such as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=198"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://soapgun.blogspot.com/2005/06/mercury-autism-and-imus.html"&gt;Don Imus&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/deirdre_imus_gives_everyone_some_stupid.php"&gt;Deirdre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Jenny’s combination of good looks and utter obnoxiousness led to her showing up all over the media in 2008. For example, on April 1 (appropriately enough), she &lt;a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2008/04/jenny-mccarthy-and-david-kirby-on-larry.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;appeared on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=762"&gt;shouted down physicians&lt;/a&gt; who had the temerity to tell her that her Google University knowledge was just plain wrong. The pinnacle of her influence came during the summer, when, having now supplanted J.B. Handley as the public face of the antivaccine group &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; and transforming GR into “Jenny McCarthy’s autism charity,” she led the “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139"&gt;Green Our Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;” rally in Washington, DC. True, at most there were several hundred people there, but it got wide news attention, and Jenny was all over the news. She rapidly followed it up by releasing a second book &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Mother Warriors: A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/ask_jenny_mccarthy_a_question.php"&gt;appearing on &lt;em&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/em&gt; yet again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=186"&gt;Amanda Peet&lt;/a&gt; joined the fray on the pro-vaccine side, it let the media to portray the vaccine issue as a &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,430437,00.html"&gt;celebrity cat fight&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, thanks to Jenny’s ties with the Playboy organization and her celebrity friends, she was able to fill Generation Rescue’s coffers with the proceeds of celebrity “autism” events where luminaries such as &lt;a href="http://www.showbizspy.com/showbiz/07202008/britney-spears-makes-surprise-appearance-at-fundraiser"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gossipgirls.com/photo/charlie-sheen-brooke-mueller-3"&gt;Charlie Sheen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.gossipgirls.com/photo/hugh-hefner-girls-next-door"&gt;Hugh Hefner&lt;/a&gt; would show up. Add to that her promotion of &lt;a href="http://www.celebritiesagainstautism.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Celebrities Against Autism&lt;/a&gt; and her partnering with &lt;a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/snme/generationrescuesnme/"&gt;professional wrestling&lt;/a&gt; and celebrity &lt;a href="http://www.anteupforautism.org/"&gt;poker events with Lance Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s a chunk of change that’s allowed GR and the equally antivaccine and quackery-friendly &lt;a href="http://www.talkaboutcuringautism.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;TACA&lt;/a&gt; to rebrand themselves in the eyes of the public as respectable autism charities, rather than crank organizations pushing a scientifically discredited idea and thereby endangering public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was the Hannah Poling case, which has been extensively discussed here, both &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=66"&gt;by me&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=174"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. In brief, the government awarded compensation for vaccine injury through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to the family of a girl named Hannah Poling, manifested a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder after a “catch up” vaccination session. It was later determined that Hannah suffers from a highly unusual mitochondrial disorder, which rendered her susceptible to neurologic injury from high fevers. She had high fevers after the vaccine, but she had also had a series of ear infections. The antivaccine movement has done its best to make Hannah its poster child as “smoking gun proof” that the government had admitted that vaccines can cause autism in susceptible children, when it had done nothing of the kind. Because the science is difficult, and because mitochondrial disorders are so uncommon, though, David Kirby and his fellow mouthpieces at Age of Autism had a field day twisting the scientific evidence and, as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=344"&gt;Mark Crislip likes to say&lt;/a&gt;, making therapeutic (or, in this case causative) mountains out of clinical molehills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly 2008 was the high water mark of the antivaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, not all was positive for the the disease promotion movement, even in 2008. For example, the second half of the year, after at least four years of no activity there was actual pushback against it. Amanda Peet spearheaded the &lt;a href="http://www.ecbt.org"&gt;Every Child By Two&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which was designed to encourage parents to have their children vaccinated. Not long after, Dr. Paul Offit, to antivaccinationists the Dark Lord of Vaccines, a veritable Darth Vader, Lord Sauron, and Satan Incarnate himself, released &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=220"&gt;his excellent book&lt;/a&gt; telling in clear, easily accessible language, exactly why scientists conclude that vaccines do not cause autism and why the various “biomedical treatments” recommended for “vaccine injury” in the form of autism are virtually all quackery. Finally, as the year wound to a close, a group of scientists from Cornell tried to replicate the results of one of the godfathers of the antivaccine movement, Andrew Wakefield. Wakefield’s studies, starting in 1998 in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, had concluded that the measles virus in the MMR vaccine somehow invaded the gut and caused a syndrome that led to regressive autism and inflammatory bowel disease–and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=200"&gt;found no correlation between MMR vaccination and any such syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Andrew Wakefield, as you recall, is the man who, more than anyone else, caused the anti-MMR scare in the U.K. and Europe that has resulted in the resurgence of measles. Indeed, he is a hero of the antivaccine movement, so much so that the antivaccine propaganda blog Age of Autism gave him &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/age-of-autism-awards-2008-galileo-award-dr-andrew-wakefield.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;the “Galileo Award” for 2008&lt;/a&gt;, completely ignoring the fact that, for a “maverick scientist,” it is not sufficient to be reviled. One must also be right, which Wakefield was most assuredly not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because one of the two body blows to the antivaccine movement that have already occurred in 2009 involves Andrew Wakefield, this is the perfect place to segue from the best of years for antivaccinationists to (thus far) the worst of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;2009: The Worst of Years, thanks to Andrew Wakefield&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2009 dawned, the antivaccine movement seemed strong and getting stronger. Having successfully framed themselves as “pro-safe vaccine, not antivaccine” and popularized the cleverly Orwellian slogans “Green Our Vaccines” and “Too Many Too Soon,” they had stoked fear of vaccination on both sides of the Atlantic, to the point where vaccination rates had begun to fall below the level necessary for herd immunity, and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases were becoming apparent. In the U.K., thanks to Andrew Wakefield and the antivaccine movement his work had spawned, over the last decade, MMR vaccination rates had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php"&gt;fallen below 80% (and in some parts of London, below 60%)&lt;/a&gt;, leading a disease once considered defeated to come roaring back to the point where last year U.K. health authorities had to &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;admit that it is once again endemic&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile in the U.S., outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseaseas were occurring among unvaccinated populations, such as &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e0123a1.htm"&gt;in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, while measles was &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5733a1.htm"&gt;also making a comeback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I could never understand about Andrew Wakefield is why so many believed him. The British press ate his bad science up and were complicit in contributing to the decline in vaccination rates that endanger public health now. I, for one, was &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;not at all surprised&lt;/a&gt; at the first blow to the antivaccine movement that occurred in 2009, namely Brian Deer’s revelations that Andrew Wakefield had almost certainly &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;falsified data used in his original 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, and in brief, this is what Wakefield was found to have done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our investigation, confirmed by evidence presented to the General Medical Council (GMC), reveals that: In most of the 12 cases, the children’s ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records. Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab, in only one case did medical records suggest this was true, and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated. Hospital pathologists, looking for inflammatory bowel disease, reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal. This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A detailed account by investigative journalist &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt; (whom I met during his visit to the University of Michigan two weeks ago) can be found &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as can an account of how the MMR scare led to a return of the measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not as though this revelation should have come as a surprise. After all, the signs had all been there right from the beginning that something was not right, indeed &lt;a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000006D8F3.htm"&gt;at least as early as 2002&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, advocates of science-based medicine everywhere owe Brian Deer a huge debt of gratitude for having pursued this case for so long, as this is what he found out about Wakefield and his work. Moreover, it’s not as though warning signs weren’t there in the very paper. As Brian Deer described at the University of Michigan a couple of weeks ago, something didn’t smell right in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper. What he meant was that the results looked too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm"&gt;original 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt; made two key claims based on its findings studying twelve children, which, according to the Wakefield, had been, “consecutively referred to the pediatric gastroenterology unit at the Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine in London. First, it claimed that eight of the twelve children studied had manifested developmental regression within two weeks of the MMR vaccine, and one had developed regression after a measles infection, the clear implication being that there was a close temporal relationship between MMR vaccination and the onset of regression in 75% of the children. The second claim was that all 12 of the children demonstrated “intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration.” Although the paper stated that the authors “did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described” and that “virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue,” Wakefield at his press conference to announce the findings stated that he had preliminary virological evidence showing measles virus in the gut. It took him four years to follow up these results with a &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=11950955"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Pathology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that reported measles virus in 75/91 children with ileal inflammation and children with developmental disorders. Although Wakefield was careful not to use the word autism in the actual text of the paper–or even the word vaccine–the implication of the paper was plain, and, if it wasn’t to some, Wakefield made sure to drive home what he thought the implication was: That the MMR is associated with a syndrome of developmental disorders, including autism, and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Wakefield, Deer’s instincts ultimately proved to be correct. The first shoe to drop was Deer’s 2004 &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/dispatches-blurb.htm"&gt;Channel 4 documentary&lt;/a&gt; exposing Wakefield’s incompetence and conflicts of interest. As it turned out, Wakefield did not have the viral data in 1998. Indeed, a young investigator named Nicholas Chadwick had been unable to detect measles virus in any of the samples from the 12 children and had told Wakefield. Wakefield kept that data out of the original &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper because it did not support his hypothesis. How, then, to explain Wakefield’s &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11950955?ordinalpos=6&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;subsequent paper in 2002 &lt;/a&gt;that reported the detection of measles virus sequences in a large proportion of the ileal biopsy specimens of children with “autistic enterocolitis”? In 2007, during the beginning of the proceedings for the test cases in the Autism Omnibus case (more on that in the next section), Stephen Bustin, arguably the preeminent expert in the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect DNA sequences, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;testified for the government&lt;/a&gt; about the methods used in the laboratory that did the PCR analysis for Andrew Wakefield. Suffice it to say that this had to be about the sloppiest laboratory I’ve ever seen. Also suffice it to say that the negative controls were amplifying measles sequence, meaning that it was impossible to tell a signal was a true signal or a false positive. In fact, Bustin’s investigation concluded that what Wakefield was reporting was almost certainly all contamination from plasmids made in an adjacent laboratory. Ironically, this was the same laboratory that participated in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=200"&gt;2008 attempt to replicate Wakefield’s results&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, it had cleaned up its act by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem revealed in the 2004 documentary was that Andrew Wakefield had a massive conflict of interest. Teamed up with antivaccination crank extraordinaire &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/hugh-fudenberg.htm"&gt;Hugh Fudenberg&lt;/a&gt;, he had come up with a combination single agent vaccine/therapeutic (which he characterized as a “&lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/cure-autism.htm"&gt;cure for autism&lt;/a&gt;“) agent based on the quack favorite “&lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/goat-recipe.htm"&gt;transfer factor&lt;/a&gt;.” Not only this, but he had filed &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-patents.htm"&gt;patent applications for this concoction&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, Wakefield stood to profit handsomely if the MMR was discredited as being safe. Not long after these revelations, ten of the thirteen authors of the original 1998 Lancet report &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-retraction.htm"&gt;renounced its conclusions&lt;/a&gt; and asked to have their names removed from the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was even worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2006, the second shoe dropped. It turned out that Wakefield’s conflict of interest was even worse than that. In fact, it turned out that Wakefield had been paid by lawyers seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers for “injury” due to the MMR. In fact, his services had been bought and paid for to the tune of &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm"&gt;paid £435,643 in fees, plus £3,910 expenses&lt;/a&gt;. Neither this conflict of interest nor the conflict of interest inherent in having an alternative vaccine for measles, a single vaccine, with its patent pending were reported in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper. It was these revelations that triggered an investigation by the General Medical Council in the U.K. into research malfeasance and ethic violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was even worse than that. Unfortunately, it took two more years to find out just how bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Brian Deer reported in the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt; that, not only had Andrew Wakefield had massive conflicts of interest, but he had falsified data in his original paper. Indeed, consistent with the revelations that there had never been any detectable measles viral sequences, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;Deer reported&lt;/a&gt; that one father had taken his child’s specimen to be tested by a different laboratory and that that laboratory had failed to find any trace of measles virus. More importantly, however, none of the children studied for the Lancet paper actually even came from the Royal Free Hospital’s catchment area of North London; indeed, none of them even came from London. In fact, they were not “consecutively referred,” either. Rather, they had been recruited through the anti-MMR antivaccine underground and 11/12 of them were involved in anti-MMR litigation. Thus, they were a highly selected group. In addition, ccording to Deer’s account of the records examined by the GMC, in most of these children autistic features were present &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they had received their MMR vaccination and in others such features only became apparent after a much longer interval than a few days after MMR. In other words, what was reported in the Lancet paper in 1998 and what was found in the children’s medical records differed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, one of two things happened, neither of which is flattering to Wakefield. Either he took the history only from parents, who were litigants in vaccine injury cases and for whom confirmation bias could easily have led to remembering incorrectly that their child’s behavioral changes were noted shortly after the MMR rather than before it or months later. If this was the case, Wakefield was incompetent for not having examined the medical records. Alternatively, Wakefield did examine the medical records and lied about them in the Lancet paper. If this is the case, he is dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I might have been willing to give Wakefield somewhat of the benefit of the doubt, viewing the discrepancies between the medical records and what he reported in the Lancet paper as being yet more evidence of his incompetence and his resultant shoddy research methodology rather than dishonesty, were it not for the major discrepancies between what Wakefield said about the histology of the biopsy specimens in the paper. What was reported in the paper does not jibe with what the pathologists who first examined the specimens saw, where, in all 12 cases, no abnormalities had been reported on the initial examination of the specimens. Yet Wakefield reported a distinctive pattern of gut inflammation, specifically “colitis and ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia.” The Lancet paper had pointed out the “uniformity” of the pathological changes. What had happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not happy with the readings of the pathologists, apparently Wakefield’s research team met for a “research review” of the biopsy specimens. This in and of itself is not unusual. However, it is unusual that the research team overturned the original readings of so many of the specimens. It is even more unusual (i.e., suspicious) that the reinterpretations of the original readings all went in the same direction: towards a reading of inflammation consistent with Wakefield’s hypothesis that the measles virus from the MMR was somehow involved in causing gut abnormalities and autistic regression. Even if I wanted to attribute Wakefield’s problems to incompetence, it’s pretty hard to do, given the confluence of evidence from multiple sources pointing to malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;2009: The Worst of Years, as the Special Masters Weigh In&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the revelations about Andrew Wakefield’s research fraud were the only event thus far, 2009 would already be shaping up to be a bad year for antivaccinationists. However, less than a week after Deer’s revelations were reported, the long-awaited ruling in a huge legal action made up of approximately 5,000 parents who are convinced that vaccines caused their children’s autism. I’m referring to the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/omnibus-autism-proceeding"&gt;Autism Omnibus proceedings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., because of rising litigation that jeopardized the vaccine program and threatened to drive pharmaceutical companies out of the vaccine business, Congress passed the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986&lt;/a&gt; (Public Law 99-660), which created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). The idea was to create an alternative to the tort system through which people injured by vaccines could be efficiently compensated. Vaccine litigants, if denied compensation, could still sue in conventional courts, but all claims for compensation had to go first through the VICP. Moreover, the standards of evidence in the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/vaccine-programoffice-special-masters"&gt;Vaccine Court&lt;/a&gt; of the VICP are arguably markedly lower than in conventional federal courts. For example, Daubert rules for scientific evidence do not apply. Indeed, all that is necessary is a scientifically plausible-sounding mechanism by which a plaintiff might have been injured by vaccines, and compensation can be awarded. In essence, lowering the Daubert standard and allowing “science” that has not yet been peer reviewed makes meeting the standard of evidence showing a 51% or greater chance that the plaintiff was injured by the vaccine in question easier because it opened the door to an antivaccinationist version of the &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gish_gallop"&gt;Gish Gallup&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the defense to answer and refute all sorts of bad science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, as the number of litigants claiming that vaccines caused their children’s autism ballooned to close to 5,000, threatening to bankrupt the VICP unless massive infusions of new money from Congress were provided, it was decided that the proceedings should be bundled into one massive legal action known as the Autism Omnibus. As part of this proceeding, litigants were to choose what they considered to be the best cases representing their hypothesis of causation by which vaccines could produce autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The court would hear these cases, make a rulings, and then these rulings would be used as the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Background_on_the_autism_proceedings.pdf"&gt;basis for all similar cases as follows&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Petitioners’ Steering Committee (PSC) has advanced three different theories of “general causation,” i.e., how the vaccines involved can cause autism, in the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. The Office of Special Masters (OSM) has assigned three Special Masters to resolve the autism cases. The OSM instructed the PSC to designate three “test cases” for each of the three theories, a total of nine test cases. The three theories of “general causation” are: (1) the theory that MMR vaccines and thimerosal-containing vaccines can combine to cause autism; (2) the theory that thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause autism; and, (3) the theory that MMR vaccines, without regard to any thimerosal additive, can cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than a year and a half after the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_when_you_dont_have_sc.php"&gt;proceedings began&lt;/a&gt;, on February 12, the Special Masters released its decisions on the first three test cases, &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf"&gt;Cedillo v. HHS&lt;/a&gt; (Case No. 98-916V), &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Campbell-Smith%20Hazlehurst%20Decision.pdf"&gt;Hazlehurst v. HHS&lt;/a&gt; (Case No. 03-654V) and &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Vowell.Snyder.pdf"&gt;Snyder v. HHS&lt;/a&gt; (Case No. 01-162V). In all three cases, despite the “best” that the antivaccine contingent could throw at the courts, the Special Masters &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478"&gt;decisively rejected all three hypotheses of causation&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the results surprised me, as I had expected, given the extremely low bar for evidence, that there would have been a little bit of wiggle room in the decisions that would leave the door open for the antivaccine fringe to claim that there was a possibility that further causation cases would be entertained. No such wiggle room was granted. Since the decisions together run hundreds of pages, this article has become quite long, and &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1874"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/183"&gt;bloggers&lt;/a&gt; have posted excerpts, I will be judicious in selecting key quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, from the ruling on &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Cedillo v. HHS&lt;/a&gt;, written by Special Master George L. Hastings, Jr., we have these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“This case, however, &lt;em&gt;is not a close case&lt;/em&gt;. The overall weight of the evidence is &lt;em&gt;overwhelmingly contrary&lt;/em&gt; to the petitioners’ causation theories. The result of this case would be the same even if I totally ignored the epidemiologic evidence, declined to consider the video evidence, and/or excluded the testimony of Dr. Bustin. The result would be the same if I restricted my consideration to the evidence originally filed into the record of this &lt;em&gt;Cedillo&lt;/em&gt; case, disregarding the general causation evidence from the &lt;em&gt;Hazlehurst&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Snyder&lt;/em&gt; cases. The petitioners’ evidence has been unpersuasive on many different points, concerning virtually all aspects of their causation theories, each such deficiency having been discussed in detail above. The petitioners have failed to persuade me that there is validity to any of their &lt;em&gt;general causation&lt;/em&gt; arguments, and have also failed to persuade me that there is any substantial likelihood that Michelle’s MMR vaccination contributed in any way to the causation of any of &lt;em&gt;Michelle’s own disorders&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Nor do I doubt that Michelle’s parents and relatives are sincere in their belief that the MMR vaccine played a role in causing Michelle’s devastating disorders. Certainly, the mere fact that Michelle’s autistic symptoms first became evident to her family during the months after her MMR vaccination might make them wonder about a possible causal connection. Further, the Cedillos have read about physicians who profess to believe in a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and both autism and chronic gastrointestinal problems. They have visited at least one physician, Dr. Krigsman, who has explicitly opined that Michelle’s own chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are MMR-caused. And they have even been told that a medical laboratory has positively identified the presence of the persisting vaccine-strain measles virus in Michelle’s body, years after her vaccination. After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months, I am convinced that the reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle’s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions, have been very wrong. Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment. Nevertheless, I can understand why the Cedillos found such reports and advice to be believable under the circumstances. I conclude that the Cedillos filed this Program claim in good faith.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, from the second case, &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Campbell-Smith%20Hazlehurst%20Decision.pdf"&gt;Hazlehurst v. HHS&lt;/a&gt;, Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having carefully and fully considered the evidence, the undersigned concludes that the combination of the thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine are not causal factors in the development of autism and therefore, could not have contributed to the development of Yates’ autism. The weight of the presented evidence that is scientifically reliable and methodologically sound does not support petitioners’ claim. Petitioners have failed to establish entitlement to compensation under the Vaccine Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, from the third case, &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Vowell.Snyder.pdf"&gt;Snyder v. HHS&lt;/a&gt;, Special Master Denise Vowell wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conclude that Colten’s condition was the result of his MMR vaccine, an objective observer would have to emulate Lewis Carroll’s White Queen and be able to believe six impossible (or, at least, highly improbable) things before breakfast. The families of children with ASD and the court have waited in vain for adequate evidence to support the autism-MMR hypothesis. Although I have the deepest sympathy for families like Colten’s, struggling emotionally and financially to find answers about ASD’s causes, and reliable therapies to treat ASD’s symptoms, I must decide Colten’s case based on the evidence before me. That evidence does not establish an adequate factual basis from which to conclude that Colten’s condition was caused by his vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Colten’s condition was either caused or significantly aggravated by his vaccinations Thus, they have failed to establish entitlement to compensation and the petition for compensation is therefore DENIED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ow. That last one’s going to leave a mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more emphatic refutation is hard to imagine. Even better, Special Master Hastings recognized one of the main drivers of the scare over the MMR and vaccines in general as a “cause” of autism: Money. Indeed, a veritable cottage industry of “biomedical” quackery, dubious therapies, and pseudoscience depends upon keeping the idea that vaccines cause autism alive. “Luminaries” of this cottage industry include the aforementioned Andrew Wakefield, who has now infested the United States (the State of Texas, specifically) with his brand of quackery at &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/bio_awakefield.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Thoughtful House&lt;/a&gt;, now that the U.K. is investigating him. Also included are Mark and David Geier, who have been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/why_not_just_castrate_them_1.php"&gt;touting the use of a powerful anti-sex steroid medication&lt;/a&gt; to treat autistic children, and, until recently, &lt;a href="http://www.drbuttar.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Rashid Buttar&lt;/a&gt;, who is now &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=105"&gt;facing sanctions by the North Carolina Board of Medical Examiners&lt;/a&gt; and has been banned from treating children. Add to that ambulance-chasing lawyers like Clifford Shoemaker, who have been &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/149/"&gt;raking in money hand over fist&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the fact that the VICP actually pays the petitioners’ attorney fees regardless of whether the petition results in compensation, and it is easy to see why this industry won’t easily let parents be disabused of the fears over vaccines that it has stoked. (Indeed, Shoemaker even tried to &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/150/"&gt;abuse the subpoena process&lt;/a&gt; in order to quash reports of how much money he was making representing VICP litigants, an action for which he was &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/164/"&gt;sanctioned by the courts&lt;/a&gt;.) In the case of Andrew Wakefield, attorneys looking for big payouts from the pharmaceutical industry have even paid for research. Meanwhile, as documented on this blog before, some researchers producing reports implicating vaccines in autism are actually petitioners in the Autism Omnibus, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;Laura Hewitson&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/bio_dhollenbeck.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;husband works for Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, while compounding pharmacies &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/ourkidsasd-offers-powerful-turmeric-in-enhansa.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;advertise their supplements&lt;/a&gt; and other dubious “remedies” right on the Age of Autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who support science- and evidence-based medicine were quite heartened by the revelations about Andrew Wakefield and the ruling in the Autism Omnibus. True, we wondered why it took 11 years for the revelations about Wakefield’s incompetence and outright fraud to see the light of day, but we were glad that they finally had. One reason is that, to the vast majority of lay people who are parents, the science is hard to understand, and the antivaccine movement had, more or less successfully, framed the issue as big pharma protecting its interests and a conflict between “brave maverick” doctors against government and pharma experts. However, fraud is something that people understand all too well. Demonstrating that Wakefield’s results were riddled not just with conflicts of interest but with outright scientific fraud made the issue very clear, driving home that there was no scientific basis to suspect that the MMR had anything to do with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. Similarly, the ruling of the Vaccine Court on the first three test cases surprised me. As I mentioned earlier, I had expected some wiggle room and was heartened to see that, contrary to what I had expected, science won unequivocally and resoundingly in court, at least in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Antivaccinationists circle the wagons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of the antivaccine fringe to the rulings of the Special Masters and the revelations about Andrew Wakefield’s scientific fraud are instructive. Let’s examine the reaction to the Wakefield revelations first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but if I passionatedly believed that the MMR vaccine causes autism or, even worse, caused autism in my child, I would be feeling very betrayed right now. In fact, I’d turn on Wakefield like a wild boar. But that’s just me. Apparently, that’s not the reaction of most of the antivaccine fringe. Indeed, the antivaccine propaganda blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; and David Kirby, along with other antivaccine groups, immediately orchestrated a smear campaign against Brian Deer based on the flimsiest of pretenses. For example, in response to Keith Olbermann’s having correctly picked Andrew Wakefield as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/andrew_wakefield_worst_person_in_the_wor.php"&gt;his “worst person in the world” for February 10, 2009&lt;/a&gt;, David Kirby cleverly played upon Olbermann’s hatred of Rupert Murdoch, pointing out that The Times of London is a Murdoch paper. This &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/keith-olbermann-todays-be_b_166103.html"&gt;allowed Kirby to brag&lt;/a&gt; before the February 11 “Worst Person in the World” segment that he had persuaded Olbermann to name Brian Deer as one of the “worst persons in the world,” even publishing the script. Truly, Olbermann had been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/keith_olbermann_played_for_a_fool.php"&gt;played for a fool by the antivaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;. The specious claim? That somehow Deer had a huge conflict of interest because he made the complaint to the GMC about Wakefield, a meme started by the British version of David Kirby, &lt;a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3362116/a-deer-in-the-headlights.thtml"&gt;Melanie Phillips&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also a claim that, even if true, would mean nothing, as it does absolutely nothing to refute the &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm"&gt;findings in Deer’s reporting&lt;/a&gt; or the results thus far of the GMC’s investigation. Indeed, the ad hominems went beyond that. For example, Jane Bryant of OneClick Group has tried to paint Brian Deer as “&lt;a href="http://www.theoneclickgroup.co.uk/news.php?start=2620&amp;amp;end=2640&amp;amp;view=yes&amp;amp;id=3282"&gt;out of control&lt;/a&gt;,” during which she couldn’t seem to resist &lt;a href="http://www.blacktriangle.org/blog/?p=1908"&gt;trying homophobia on for size&lt;/a&gt;, stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By all accounts a gay man and therefore unlikely ever to have to face the multiple vaccine risk agonised over by parents from around the world in relation to their children, Brian Deer has made it his business to portray the parents of these autistic vaccine damaged children as deluded mendacious chancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this particularly ironic and despicable, given that chief antivaccine propagandist David Kirby is almost certainly also gay and that his previous jobs have included reporting for &lt;a href="http://outweek.net/"&gt;Outweek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.advocate.com"&gt;The Advocate&lt;/a&gt;. One’s sexual orientation is completely irrelevant to one’s arguments. Only data, evidence, reason, and science should matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when all else fails, the antivaccine movement plays the conspiracy card, as John Stone of the British antivaccine group &lt;a href="http://www.cryshame.co.uk/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cry Shame&lt;/a&gt; did on–where else?–&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/brian-deer-history-repeating-itself-as-farce.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet the medical and political establishment has been constructing its case against Wakefield on Deer’s reporting for the last five years. It was on the back of his first report that Wakefield was held to be “discredited” and the world was brow-beaten into believing it was so. UK National Health Service websites link up to Deer’s website, and the longest medical disciplinary hearing in British history was launched on the basis of his complaint. It is a game in which everybody hides behind everybody else, pretending they can’t be seen – but actually they are all standing there, and their trousers are down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never once does it occur to Stone or, for instance, any of the pro-Wakefield commenters &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1849#comments"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that the reason Wakefield is in such trouble is because he is a dishonest, incompetent, and unethical scientist. This, of course, is a perfect segue into the reaction to the Autism Omnibus rulings, which cranked the antivaccine fringe into ever more histrionic fits of conspiracy mongering. Indeed, leave it to our “old friend” J.B. Handley to connect the two by &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/did-the-department-of-justice-tip-off-brian-deer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;insinuating that the U.S. Department of Justice had tipped off Brian Deer somehow&lt;/a&gt;, so that his revelations could be published in close temporal proximity to the announcement of the first Autism Omnibus rulings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I found it rather odd that Brian Deer torpedoed Andy over the weekend with a seemingly made-up outrage piece, only days before the judges ruled in the Vaccine Court. The timing struck me as odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ever-reliable antivaccine advocate Kent Heckenlively, whose understanding of science is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;astonishingly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=100"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;, posted “analyses” of each decision. Some tidbits follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/the-cedillo-decision.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Regarding the Cedillo decision&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his closing remarks he notes that the decision was not even close, and that the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who saw an opportunity to take advantage of a family who thought their child had been injured by a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as those of who have children with autism and choose to help them are under great stress, I just viscerally respond to this attack against those physicians who are doing their best to help our children.  They choose to enter this fight, knowing they will be attacked, but strengthened by the conviction they can help some of our children.  To many of them, we owe our children’s future.  And when they have not been able to find the answer, they continue to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is apparent to anybody who looks at this unfolding tragedy that the pharmaceutical companies have no interest in helping us, the medical universities and research facilities can offer us no help, and now we know we have no friends in the vaccine court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/the-hazlehurst-decision.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Regarding the Hazlehurst decision&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sad truth of the matter is that we are massively out-gunned in terms of research dollars.  The medical personnel who undertake our cause do it knowing full well there will be many defeats.  Judges will be dazzled by experts who claim to know so much, except for the question of what causes autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/the-snyder-decision.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;regarding the Snyder decision&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to figure out how to explain this decision, and the best I can come up with is an example from the book, “Blink” by Malcom Gladwell.  In the book Gladwell recounts the difficulty female musicians had in being hired by professional orchestras, particularly for the wind instruments.  They were thought to lack the lung capacity of men.  But when the auditions began to use screens, so the conductors couldn’t see the gender of the person playing, the number of women hired by professional orchestras increased five-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the conductors would probably have sworn they were free of sexism, and may have truly believed it, but something else was clearly at work.  Although the claim was made that they were simply listening to the music and picking the best people, the different results obtained after the use of the screens showed a significantly different mental process going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only conclude that something similar is at work in the minds of the Special Masters, and perhaps many people who will look at what we allege.  Despite their efforts to carefully weigh the evidence, something else is tipping the scales.  I don’t believe it’s money, at least in the crudest sense of the word.  It’s money in the sense that it’s built the entire edifice and world-view in which the Special Masters are looking at these claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, to translate: The pharmaceutical companies paid for the verdict, and the judges were unconsciously biased against all those “brave maverick doctors” testifying for the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps clearest, most blatant “it was fixed” argument comes from Dr. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=319"&gt;Jay&lt;/a&gt; “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Don’t Call Me Antivaccine&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Gordon&lt;/a&gt; in two posts he wrote for that repository for antivaccine posturing, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/there-is-no-proof-that-ci_b_167157.html"&gt;“There Is No Proof that Cigarettes Cause Cancer”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/the-vaccine-court-was-wro_b_167374.html"&gt;The Vaccine Court Was Wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s take a look at his&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/there-is-no-proof-that-ci_b_167157.html"&gt; first bit of idiocy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took fifty years before the courts finally acknowledged that cigarette smoking causes cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were billions of dollars at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dozens of court decisions that there “was no proof” were supported by physicians, expert witnesses of all types and hundreds of millions of dollars spent on attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts and doctors alike stated over and over again that we need not continue studying this issue because there was just no proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me state very simply, vaccines can cause autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real scientist would encourage us to stop studying this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the blatant straw man argument (”No real scientist would encourage us to stop studying this possibility”). Note the specious and false comparison that antivaccine advocates love to use: Comparing tobacco research to vaccine research. No matter how easy it is to demonstrate how wrong they are, they think it’s a slam dunk comparison that bolsters their paranoid, conspiracy mongering world view. After all, decades ago, scientists kept finding scientific and epidemiological evidence that tobacco smoking causes lung cancer and all manner of other health problems. Tobacco companies funded a well-financed denialist campaign of lies, bad science, and outright pseudoscience to try to convince the public that there was no link between smoking and cancer in order to protect their profits and forestall the regulation or banning of cigarettes by the government. So to antivaccinationists, it seems perfectly reasonable to claim that claiming that vaccines cause autism is the same thing, except with the evil big pharma vaccine manufacturers suppressing the “truth” to protect &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; profits and keep themselves safe from lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note another thing. Note the absolute certainty with which Dr. Jay states unequivocally that “vaccines can cause autism.” He even uses boldface and italics in the font, but that isn’t even enough to convey his level of certainty. He has to underline it too! (I congratulate him for his restraint in not using all caps as well.) Note that Dr. Jay’s certainty comes with no scientific evidence presented whatsoever to support it. None. Zero. Zip. Nada. This is very consistent with his past behavior, in which he apparently believes that simply asserting something is the same as proving it. It isn’t; argument by assertion is the lamest form of argument. In any case, apparently, just like the antivaccine movement for which he is an apologist, Dr. Jay just &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; that vaccines cause autism, science be damned. Indeed, he demonstrates this utter belief–not science, belief–that the “proof” will someday be found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proof is not there yet. It will be found. Let’s hope it doesn’t take another fifty years and hundreds of court cases to convince the government and the public. Private industry is once again duping the FDA, doctors and the public. The conflicts of interest are obscene and illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diseases against which we vaccinate are still dangerous and still present in other countries and in America but simple risk/benefit analysis would show that the risks from the way vaccines are manufactured and administered far outweighs the risks of harm from these relatively rare illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure thing, Dr. Jay, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Files"&gt;The Truth Is Out There&lt;/a&gt;. Fox Mulder and Dana Scully have taught us this, and Dr. Jay &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to believe. Oh, does he ever &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why these two victories for science will not, as many hope, put a damper on the antivaccine movement. They just won’t. To those who cling to the scientifically discredited idea that vaccines cause autism against the mountains of evidence that do not support it, as &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1896"&gt;Kev points out&lt;/a&gt;, it is not about science. It is about winning and convincing people that they are right. It is about finding someone or something to “blame” for their children’s autism. To them, doctors have no authority. Scientists have no authority. The Special Masters have no authority. The scientific method means nothing. Only their personal experiences and the conclusions they draw from them, no matter how fallible humans are at drawing inferences from them, matter. To them, as Dr. Jay Gordon made explicit when he spoke to the “Green Our Vaccines” rally last summer, and said that his die hard belief that vaccines cause autism is based on states that he bases his conclusions that vaccines probably cause more harm than good &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;on “over 30 years” of his own experience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;above all&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis mine) “listening to you,” meaning the parents who believe vaccines “injured” their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because the battle between parents who believe that vaccines cause autism and scientists is a battle about, more than anything else, two world views. Scientists, knowing how easily humans fool themselves into confusing correlation with causation when drawing conclusions from personal experience and anecdotes, rely on epidemiology and the scientific method to answer the question of whether vaccination is associated with autism. In contrast, the believers cannot accept that they can be fooled. Dr. Rahul K. Parikh described this conflict well in a recent article&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/vital_signs/2009/02/19/autism_and_vaccines/index.html"&gt; on the Omnibus decision:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those expressing shock and disappointment was Rebecca Estepp, the mother of an autistic child, who is one of the claimants and the national manager of the advocacy group Talk About Curing Autism. “It’s tough when you’re taking parent support calls and you hear the same story day after day,” she told the Wall Street Journal. “When does anecdotal evidence become enough?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her question isn’t a new one, especially in a society where belief, emotion and science so often conflict. For scientists, the answer to Estepp’s question is never. Developing a hypothesis from anecdotes or observations (whether one or a hundred of them) is merely the first step in a longer process. Next comes the hard part: testing that hypothesis to see if you can back it up with hard data, and then sharing the data with others to see if they can reproduce the findings, often multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more accurately, Dr. Parikh states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, read that headline again: “Vaccines Didn’t Cause Autism, Court Rules.” It doesn’t say, “Vaccines Didn’t Cause Autism, a Decade’s Worth of Rigorously Conducted and Verified Medical Research Rules.” That may not be as sexy as the recent headline, but it is the truth. The scientific community disproved the vaccine-autism connection long ago, multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is true (except that it’s well over a decade’s worth of research), and to which I would add: The scientific community only continues to study the vaccine-autism connection, churning out negative study after negative study because it hopes to convince those who are unconvinceable by science. Indeed, just how unconvinceable they are is summed up in this &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/olmsted-on-autism-steel-thyself.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e20105371f49b5970b#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e20105371f49b5970b" rel="nofollow"&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt; by Rolf Hazelhurst, the father of one of the three complainants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we win, we keep going.&lt;br&gt;
If we lose, we keep going.&lt;br&gt;
If we win, the going will be easier.&lt;br&gt;
If we lose, the going will be more difficult.&lt;br&gt;
However, the Court rules, we will keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a religious, cultish attitude. A little thing like a news report revealing the hero of the antivaccine movement to be a scientific fraud or a court ruling that, even under the most favorable standards of evidence imaginable, vaccines do not cause autism will not change the mind of someone like this, nor will it make the antivaccine movement have second thoughts about its cultish beliefs. The only hope that we who support science-based medicine can have is that these two body blows to the antivaccine movement will finally–finally!–drive home the message to the media that, when it comes to the claim that vaccines cause autism, there’s no there there, as they say. We can also hope that the fence-sitters, those parents who may have heard Jenny McCarthy ranting about how vaccines caused her son Evan’s autism and how she cured him with various biomedical interventions may see these two repudiations of the myth that vaccines cause autism and be reassured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy can hope, can’t he?&lt;/p&gt;

Among the few things this county is famous for is being one of the only areas in the country that still abides by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_law"&gt;blue laws&lt;/a&gt;. These are a set of silly laws that prevent consumers from buying most things and most businesses from being open on Sundays because it’s the Christian Sabbath. . .err, I mean because locals like having a day off without a lot of traffic. Riiiiight! That’s of course been the excuse most commonly used to avoid the reality that this county is in direct violation of the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/02/22/erasing-blue-laws-to-help-economy/"&gt;Friendly Atheist just wrote a great blog&lt;/a&gt; that drew my attention to an &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1880340,00.html?xid=feed-yahoo-top-linkbox"&gt;article in Time&lt;/a&gt; that says Sunday alcohol restrictions are ending in some areas because of the crappy economy. Now something that needs to be made clear is that blue laws don’t just restrict alcohol. In my home county blue laws prevent the malls from being open (and keep in mind I live in New Jersey, home of the greatest malls in America), and most stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper about it. I couldn’t find it online but here’s a reprint of what I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding “Blue laws revisited” (Page A-1, May 25), Pennsylvania law considers residences housing 4 women and containing a kitchen to be brothels. New Jersey Blue Laws are only slightly less dopey. But unlike the former, the latter violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. Claiming this is about having a day free of traffic is simply a lame excuse to justify imposing one religion’s rituals on the rest of us. One cannot ignore the inherent religious nature of blue laws, first enacted by the London Missionary Society and inspired by Methodist missionaries. Is there any doubt those who support these backwards laws would fervently object to switching the traffic-less day from Sunday to Tuesday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while attempts to Google the specific guidelines proved unsuccessful, discovering these laws have turned Bergen County into the laughing stock of the nation took no time at all. Even Michael Gartland’s article illustrates the law’s absurdity: “customers can buy a hammer but not wood.” I’ve noticed similar ridiculous restrictions like allowing the purchase of spatulas but not forks or spoons. And I still can’t find The Bible passage that clarifies you can buy Pepsi but not an iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orthodox Jews are hardly the only ones being inconvenienced. What of those with no religion at all whose liberties are trampled on to satisfy Bronze Age superstitions? Those business owners concerned with how less restrictive laws will be enforced should consider how little they’re enforced now. Indeed, what is even the point of having an unnecessary law that isn’t enforced and is virtually unenforceable? Blue laws are unconstitutional and silly, and I for one encourage more people to violate them.&lt;/p&gt;

The thought's not going to mean much unless you go read the old post, so I'm putting it below the fold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Job suffered more than Jesus did. Going along the thought toward the end of that old post, wouldn't suffering on the level of Job's have been more the sort of thing that we'd expect for someone suffering for all of humanity, past, present and future? Wouldn't it be more in line with scriptural precedent for Jesus to have suffered like Job did? Rather than having to torture some passage about "piercing" as though it were a prophecy of crucifixion, Christians trying to demonstrate prophecies about Jesus could point to the Book of Job and say "look!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can imagine it now, with Christ amassing a following, starting his church in defiance of the Pharisees, marrying and starting a family, and ultimately making it to the apex of his life when God starts taking things away from him--first his followers, then his children, then his wife, then his health (but not so much that he is actually close to dying, to joining his family in the afterlife). Finally, his former friends betray him, the Pharisees force him to recant his message and deny his teachings before the masses, then betray him again to the Romans. Finally as he rots, broken and bullied and impotent in a Roman dungeon, Jesus looks toward the sky through a barred window. Job had the patience of a saint, but Jesus has the patience of a man, and he cries out--"My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" And unlike Job, he curses God, unable to remain loyal when he has lost so much. That's the kind of suffering that I'd expect from someone who's suffering for everyone. It seems like ending the Jesus story with him losing faith, committing the unforgivable sin--with &lt;i&gt;God denying God&lt;/i&gt;--would be the more poignant and powerful resolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More and more, it seems like God just doesn't understand good writing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-3479663098344708669?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235365945267"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10614446.post-5353188693679378153">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee3fd4475a9ce3a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The 105th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle--with added Shakespeare!</title><published>2009-02-13T03:34:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T03:34:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2009/02/105th-meeting-of-skeptics-circle-with.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Orac)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Circular Reasoning</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235362080598"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/why-do-i-watch-the-oscars-th/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e5e29872fda6b59</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">why do I watch the #oscars? th…</title><published>2009-02-23T03:54:22Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T03:54:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/why-do-i-watch-the-oscars-th/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;why do I watch the #oscars? they always bore me&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235358553032"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/aaaaargh.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e2425e06d076d8a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">Aaaaargh</title><published>2009-02-23T02:22:12Z</published><updated>2009-02-23T02:22:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/UlfiNTz1zks/aaaaargh.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/aaaaargh.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been quiet here today for a good reason: I&amp;#39;m facing a bunch of deadlines, and I told myself I&amp;#39;d stay offline until I&amp;#39;d met them.

&lt;p&gt;Or, as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Laurie"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hugh Laurie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says in an &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/mmemym/bits2/fal0083.htm"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/abitoffryandlaurie/index.shtml"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fry &amp;amp; Laurie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “only thanks to the purest good fortune that they don’t happen to have been born yet, otherwise I dread to think what damage may have been caused!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do have kids (&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7846822.stm"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt; or humans) I will immunize them, in the same way that I was immunized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Be wise, immunize..." src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/immunize.gif?w=150&amp;amp;h=161" alt="Be wise, immunize..." width="150" height="161"&gt;I remember the day still. I was five, and had the afternoon off from school. That, in itself, was a boon. Wearing a &lt;a href="http://www.humphreybear.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humphrey B. Bear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; t-shirt (a creepy, mute, honey-scoffing TV bear) I hopped aboard a mobile vaccination bus (not to be confused with the &lt;a href="http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/4196"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation bus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and was jabbed a couple of times. For this, I was rewarded with a packet of &lt;strong&gt;UFO chips&lt;/strong&gt; (some things never change, eh?) and a &lt;strong&gt;Be Wise – Immunize&lt;/strong&gt; sticker. I subsequently had my Measles, Mumps and Rubella (&lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002026.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MMR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can state categorically that I’ve never had polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps or rubella ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor did I develop autism..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; has ever developed autism from an MMR vaccine, or any other vaccine.  That’s the simple truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even read a skeptical article in the &lt;strong&gt;Sunday Mail’s&lt;/strong&gt; usually unskeptical &lt;em&gt;Body and Spirit&lt;/em&gt; that quotes Dr Andrew Marich, Director of Communicable Diseases in NSW, as saying that the MMR-Autism link has been “completely discredited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a new age rag is finally expounding this message, then hasn’t the &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/monkey.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hundreth Monkey effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; been achieved? Not so, but these kinds of articles will do well to counter the scaremongering and unfounded controversy that is currently surrounding &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MMR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a swag of scientific studies, journal articles and the world’s best minds can’t compete with a crying mother in an episode of &lt;strong&gt;Oprah&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Fun in an iron lung" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/iron-lungs.gif?w=300&amp;amp;h=200" alt="Fun in an iron lung" width="300" height="200"&gt;The inaccurate belief that vaccination causes autism is countered with statistics that vaccination saves some three million lives per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations are among the greatest breakthroughs in science and medicine in the last century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re not vigilent about vaccination, these diseases might return…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So…don’t immunize your children, if you’d rather risk that your child should be sterile, or have one leg shorter than the other, live in an iron lung, or not live at all…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things to really be scared about…&lt;/p&gt;

Charlie definitely has the "five days of school two days of weekend" thing in his system and, as he had Friday off, I expected him to start packing his lunchbox with a Capri Sun, carrots, and plastic containers (which get magically filled by "someone" overnight) Saturday night and to ask to his homework just before he went to bed----such is his &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/an-idea-of-order/"&gt;sense of order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed: Friday night, as we've been doing most every Friday, Charlie and I took the &lt;a href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/path/html/"&gt;PATH train&lt;/a&gt; into New York to get take-out and eat dinner in Jim&amp;#39;s office. If food is the end goal, there are quite a few steps that have to be gone through to get it: A ride down the highway till we&amp;#39;re past Newark Airport, after which we get on routes 1 &amp;amp; 9 and go over the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/2942942719/"&gt;Pulaski Skyway&lt;/a&gt; into Jersey City, and then up the hill on one one-way street and down the hill on another, all while hoping no one is blocking the driveway to my office building. I park and we walk about a mile to Journal Square (in a brisk cold wind last night) and take the PATH into Manhattan, and then the D train to near Jim's office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly a nice meal is a big motivator (and not only for Charlie) but each step seems to be enjoyable in itself. The ride over the Skyway----as we're going east we get one grand view of the Manhattan skyline and it's all lit up with the sun just setting----always brings a huge smile onto his face. (He loves to be up high and being in the Skyway, you do kind of feel like driving.....in the sky, you're that high up and it's a long ride and at a very fast speed.) (I'd love to get a good look too but, as I'm driving, eyes on the road.) It's the sequence of the trip that makes the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Friday night, after dinner and cleaning up Jim's desk (crumbs; noodles.....) we started to do the usual: #1 subway downtown and then a short walk to the PATH station at the World Trade Center site. It chanced that we had to make a bit of a detour, going quickly left just as we came in view of the station and Charlie's distress crescedo'd as we walked, only to peak just as we came into the station went down the escalators, and ran onto the platform. These were familiar and, by the time the train pulled back into Journal Square, Charlie was ready to run the mile back (in an even more freezing cold wind) to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how breaks from school and vacations affect our household, which Charlie is certainly at the center of. Even with advance preparation, they still feel jarring and just weird, like driving on the wrong side of the road. What makes it harder, too, is that people generally see "vacation" and "time off from school" as positive, as happy, as cause for celebration, and look a little consternated when I explain why they're not easy on Charlie and how we're all relieved when it's back to school. Certainly Charlie's glad to sleep in and do a lot of "hanging" but, as his teacher noted, he likes to be busy---Charlie's not one to pass the day in front of the TV set or playing videogames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess a working vacation is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Though how's this for a surprise: After sleeping in very late today and yesterday, Saturday, Charlie didn't pack his lunchbox---maybe we're all learning to like vacation a bit more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; If you give to a charity over the phone, there's a growing likelihood that most of your donation will go to the telemarketer instead, according to a Bee analysis of state records.

&lt;p&gt;More than a third of California charity telemarketing campaigns sent less than 20 cents on the dollar to the charities during 2007, the most recent year on record. Those campaigns and a smaller number of charity auctions and concerts raised $93 million for commercial fundraisers, and just $3 million for the charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some eye-popping numbers in the &lt;a href="http://ag.ca.gov/charities/publications/2007cfr/cfr2007.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) released by the California Attorney General.  The Bee points to the American Diabetes Association, where in California alone, commercial fundraisers generated $13,000,000 in donations at a cost of $17,000,000.  That organization is an outlier, but other prominent charities had significant negative revenue using telemarketing and other commercially-operated fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective for-profit fundraising was done on behalf of the Ronald Regan Presidential Foundation, with 92% of a $3,482,100 bounty going to the organization!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the creation of the Do-Not-Call Registry, many charitable organizations have resorted to in-person solicitation on the street.  Is this more or less invasive than telemarketing?  I'm not sure.  But I am very skeptical of the eleemosynary nature of these groups.  Several of the popular in-person solicitors work for child poverty organizations.  I'm not sure about the actual names of these charities, but "Children International" raised $1,275,675 and ended up paying the fundraiser $614,850; and "Save the Children Federation" only kept $997 of $71,811 raised.  In dead last for effectiveness is the "Children's Defense Fund," which paid the fundraiser $29,676 for raising $2,480.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/for-profit_fundraising_fleeces.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/cxbAMS2jppY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235346112383"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4170">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/21db7c229e612648</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Improving science education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="googleearth" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Google Earth"/><category term="geology" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="geology"/><title type="html">Google Earth Geological Goodies</title><published>2009-02-22T23:41:20Z</published><updated>2009-02-22T23:41:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/google-earth-ge.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via Kim at &lt;a href="http://shearsensibility.blogspot.com/2009/02/google-earth-explosion.html" rel="external "&gt;All of my faults are stress related&lt;/a&gt; (the all-time best name for a geology blog!), a collection of Google Earth KMZ files at San Diego State University called &lt;a href="http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/localgeology/getour.html" rel="external "&gt;Google Geology&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004311" title=""&gt;Kestrel-Prey Dynamic in a Mediterranean Region: The Effect of Generalist Predation and Climatic Factors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most hypotheses on population limitation of small mammals and their predators come from studies carried out in northern latitudes, mainly in boreal ecosystems. In such regions, many predators specialize on voles and predator-prey systems are simpler compared to southern ecosystems where predator communities are made up mostly of generalists and predator-prey systems are more complex. Determining food limitation in generalist predators is difficult due to their capacity to switch to alternative prey when the basic prey becomes scarce. We monitored the population density of a generalist raptor, the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus over 15 years in a mountainous Mediterranean area. In addition, we have recorded over 11 years the inter-annual variation in the abundance of two main prey species of kestrels, the common vole Microtus arvalis and the eyed lizard Lacerta lepida and a third species scarcely represented in kestrel diet, the great white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula. We estimated the per capita growth rate (PCGR) to analyse population dynamics of kestrel and predator species. Multimodel inference determined that the PCGR of kestrels was better explained by a model containing the population density of only one prey species (the common vole) than a model using a combination of the densities of the three prey species. The PCGR of voles was explained by kestrel abundance in combination with annual rainfall and mean annual temperature. In the case of shrews, growth rate was also affected by kestrel abundance and temperature. Finally, we did not find any correlation between kestrel and lizard abundances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004550" title=""&gt;Mass Stranding of Marine Birds Caused by a Surfactant-Producing Red Tide&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In November-December 2007 a widespread seabird mortality event occurred in Monterey Bay, California, USA, coincident with a massive red tide caused by the dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea. Affected birds had a slimy yellow-green material on their feathers, which were saturated with water, and they were severely hypothermic. We determined that foam containing surfactant-like proteins, derived from organic matter of the red tide, coated their feathers and neutralized natural water repellency and insulation. No evidence of exposure to petroleum or other oils or biotoxins were found. This is the first documented case of its kind, but previous similar events may have gone undetected. The frequency and amplitude of red tides have increased in Monterey Bay since 2004, suggesting that impacts on wintering marine birds may continue or increase.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004557" title=""&gt;Is Altruistic Behavior Associated with Major Depression Onset?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Previous cross-sectional study showed altruistic behaviors were harmful on major depression (MD). It is needed to investigate the impact of altruistic behaviors by its contents on the development of MD prospectively. The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) in 1995-1996 and the MIDUS Psychological Experience Follow-Up study in 1998 were analyzed (weighted N = 563). Financial support of 10 or more dollars per month had a significant impact on the development of MD in comparison to no financial support (OR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.05-6.62). Unpaid assistance and providing emotional support were not significantly associated with the development of MD in later life. Those who provide financial contribution to individuals other than family members can be at risk of developing MD.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004500" title=""&gt;Probing Evolutionary Repeatability: Neutral and Double Changes and the Predictability of Evolutionary Adaptation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question of how organisms adapt is among the most fundamental in evolutionary biology. Two recent studies investigated the evolution of Escherichia coli in response to challenge with the antibiotic cefotaxime. Studying five mutations in the β-lactamase gene that together confer significant antibiotic resistance, the authors showed a complex fitness landscape that greatly constrained the identity and order of intermediates leading from the initial wildtype genotype to the final resistant genotype. Out of 18 billion possible orders of single mutations leading from non-resistant to fully-resistant form, they found that only 27 (1.5×10−7%) pathways were characterized by consistently increasing resistance, thus only a tiny fraction of possible paths are accessible by positive selection. I further explore these data in several ways. Allowing neutral changes (those that do not affect resistance) increases the number of accessible pathways considerably, from 27 to 629. Allowing multiple simultaneous mutations also greatly increases the number of accessible pathways. Allowing a single case of double mutation to occur along a pathway increases the number of pathways from 27 to 259, and allowing arbitrarily many pairs of simultaneous changes increases the number of possible pathways by more than 100 fold, to 4800. I introduce the metric 'repeatability,' the probability that two random trials will proceed via the exact same pathway. In general, I find that while the total number of accessible pathways is dramatically affected by allowing neutral or double mutations, the overall evolutionary repeatability is generally much less affected. These results probe the conceivable pathways available to evolution. Even when many of the assumptions of the analysis of Weinreich et al. (2006) are relaxed, I find that evolution to more highly cefotaxime resistant β-lactamase proteins is still highly repeatable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004568" title=""&gt;Phylogenomics: Gene Duplication, Unrecognized Paralogy and Outgroup Choice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Comparative genomics has revealed the ubiquity of gene and genome duplication and subsequent gene loss. In the case of gene duplication and subsequent loss, gene trees can differ from species trees, thus frequent gene duplication poses a challenge for reconstruction of species relationships. Here I address the case of multi-gene sets of putative orthologs that include some unrecognized paralogs due to ancestral gene duplication, and ask how outgroups should best be chosen to reduce the degree of non-species tree (NST) signal. Consideration of expected internal branch lengths supports several conclusions: (i) when a single outgroup is used, the degree of NST signal arising from gene duplication is either independent of outgroup choice, or is minimized by use of a maximally closely related post-duplication (MCRPD) outgroup; (ii) when two outgroups are used, NST signal is minimized by using one MCRPD outgroup, while the position of the second outgroup is of lesser importance; and (iii) when two outgroups are used, the ability to detect gene trees that are inconsistent with known aspects of the species tree is maximized by use of one MCRPD, and is either independent of the position of the second outgroup, or is maximized for a more distantly related second outgroup. Overall, these results generalize the utility of closely-related outgroups for phylogenetic analysis.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_127.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/yQjzLSXXnfk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235344615477"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2200445177317883640">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b12c5e2f616a61b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I&amp;#39;ll Be Speaking at the Mid-West Regional Meeting of The Evangelical Philosophical Society</title><published>2009-03-15T03:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T12:16:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/zojlCaR_IHo/ill-be-speaking-at-mid-west-region-of.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/2200445177317883640/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=2200445177317883640" title="18 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/ill-be-speaking-at-mid-west-region-of.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">That's right!

Joseph Harvard, pastor of Durham Presbyterian. "I don't think it's a radical shift in the presbytery."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The measure must be approved by a majority of the nation's 173 presbyteries and conservative congregations including those in Charlotte and western North Carolina have already approved the amendment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gays and lesbians can be ordained within the 2.2-million-member Presbyterian Church (USA), but they must remain chaste as church standards forbid sex outside of traditional marriage between a man and woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standard applies to clergy and lay people in the Presbyterian church who participate as deacons and elders. But even if the standard is struck down, individual churches will not be required to ordain partnered gays and lesbians. It would just give those who want to the freedom to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, the issue has divided many churches. At least one church, Raleigh's Hudson Memorial Presbyterian Church, has lost members who formed a new congregation allied with the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in protest of the change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Rev. Moffit Churn, associate pastor at West Raleigh Presbyterian, said Saturday's meeting was not divisive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"We all held hands and sang 'Blessed be the Tie that Binds' in the Presbyterian way," the Rev. Moffit Churn, associate pastor at West Raleigh Presbyterian, told the newspaper. "The voice of the middle ground is being heard, at least in this presbytery. That was my sense."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Votes have to be completed by June, but half the nation's presbyteries will have voted by the end of this month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The horror.  The doom.  Hearts sink and mouths go dry.  That, however, was not my experience.  Nor does it seem a common experience for people on the spectrum themselves (read some &lt;a href="http://www.autistics.org/library/booklist.html"&gt;writing by us&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see what I mean).  Doom is not the experience for all parents either.  For many, especially those who have experienced misdiagnosis or who were diagnosed after the first 10 years of life, the feeling accompanying the correct ASD diagnosis is not one of apocalypse and horror, but of revelation and profound &lt;em&gt;relief&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the horrific (yes, heart-sinking, mouth drying, &lt;a href="http://www.ncdj.org/index.php"&gt;please be more sensitive&lt;/a&gt; yikes!) choice of words on the part of the reporter, &lt;a href="http://newsminer.com/news/2009/feb/22/tri-valley-student-triumphs-against-autism/"&gt;this story from Alaska&lt;/a&gt; reports a 13 year old girl's revelation (the girl Elyse is now 17) about being on the spectrum, and how simply knowing the diagnosis and being able to use that new awareness to her benefit, changed her life--for the better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enormous internal, personal benefits to diagnosis.  For the autistic individual, self-awareness is one of the necessary keys to effective self-advocacy and to empowerment.  Without properly understanding your needs, you can't get them met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific to those of us who were tagged with misdiagnoses such as psychosis, intellectual disability, wanting attention, a personality disorder, etc., finally getting a correct diagnosis can be critical even to survival.  I recommend a reading of &lt;a href="http://www.mugsy.org/wendy/"&gt;Wendy Lawson's story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for those of us who, like Elyse in the Alaska article, spent years thinking we are stupid, or lazy, or broken, or unlikable, such thinking is really bad for self esteem and health.  A diagnosis gives the real reason for why a person may struggle in some situations, and that can lift a lot of guilt, confusion, and self-loathing.  Self-understanding, self-acceptance, and self-esteem can then be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are benefits to parents too--especially those parents who were wrongly blamed (at times by medical professionals even) for their child's behavior.  Parents who maybe too felt guilt for doing something "wrong" that lead to their child's struggles.  Parents who, given better understanding, are also now empowered to be more effective advocates for their kids, and better able to accept themselves as good parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social stigma against disabilities can cloud the enormous benefits of a receiving a disability label such as an autism spectrum disorder.  For many, the label brings awareness, empowerment, and improved mental and physical health.  For myself, Lawson, Elyse, and many like us, the diagnosis was not a death but a the start of being able to fully live our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235330670677"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1168">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6b46b23194355b3a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">Mark Halpern on Language Log</title><published>2009-02-22T19:22:17Z</published><updated>2009-02-22T19:22:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1168" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday afternoon, Mark Halpern sent me a response to last week's discussion of his book &lt;em&gt;Language and Human Nature&lt;/em&gt; in the post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1154"&gt;Progess and its enemies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, 2/16/2009.  It&amp;#39;s presented below as a guest post, after the usual transformation from MS Word to html.  (I take responsibility for any format or font errors that may have crept in — I&amp;#39;ve found no better way to create posts from Word files than to cut and paste the material as plain text, and then to  restore the formatting of the original as html mark-up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[Guest post by Mark Halpern]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Language Log’s treatment of my Language and Human Nature&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 16, 2009, and for a few days following, Language Log, a weblog for those interested in linguistics, discussed my new book, &lt;em&gt;Language and Human Nature&lt;/em&gt; (Transaction, 2008).   I was not notified that my work was under discussion, much less invited to join the discussion, and it was only by good luck that I learned of my fifteen minutes of fame.   Some time ago I’d created a Google Alert that was supposed to poke me in the ribs whenever my name was mentioned on the web; it did so good a job that I got into the habit of ignoring it.  It cried wolf not only every time my name came up, but also at the far more frequent times that the names Mark Halperin (of &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;magazine) and Mark Helprin (the novelist) came up, along with those of assorted physicists, genealogists, and hockey players whose name closely resembled mine.  So it was just because I happened to have an idle moment when Google alerted me on February 20 that I clicked on the link it provided, and saw to my surprise that it had found something on the web that actually pertained to me.  Although no invitation was issued to me by Language Log to participate in its proceedings, I hope that was just an oversight, and that this critique will be posted on its site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Language Log ought to have issued me such an invitation — not because they are obligated to by any rule or convention, but just because it would have made the discussion more interesting.  Many readers feel that the most exciting parts of &lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost &lt;/em&gt;are those in which Satan speaks; by the same token, might it not have enlivened the discussion of my work if I had been allowed to speak, and then had been skewered with the incisive, cogent, trenchant comments and questions that other participants would doubtless have come up with?  I think that Mark Liberman, the host or proprietor of the site, missed an opportunity to set the stage for some dramatic and possibly enlightening back-and-forth, if nothing else; perhaps with the posting of this note, something of that can yet be realized.  Here are my comments on the discussion as it ran between February 16 and 20:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.   I should not at my age be amazed, but I am still, at the number of people who voice strong views on books that they have not read.  Liberman himself clearly has read it, and quotes from it extensively, but none of the others taking part in the discussion seem to have done so.  A couple of the contributors have read my old &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; article, and thus have some idea of what I stand for; most seem to have no idea what I think or said, but don’t let that stop them from rebutting me forcefully, even violently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.   Simon Cauchi goes further: he boasts of not having read the book, and deplores the fact that it is even being discussed.  This attitude is especially strange, because in past years Cauchi and I have exchanged civil, even friendly, messages as members of the Wombat (formerly Stumpers) group.  He is mildly rebuked by Liberman, who allows that there are some interesting ideas in my book, and by marie-lucie, who remarks gently that it is surely a service to readers to make them aware of the actual contents of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  The topic that gets most thoroughly discussed is my treatment of the term Progressive and its various forms — Liberman titles the entire discussion thread “Progress and its enemies” — but my point has been missed.  What strikes me is not that so many of the people who used to call themselves Liberals now call themselves Progressives — as Liberman remarks, partisans generally choose glowing names for themselves and their policies — but the acceptance by the general public, including many conservatives, of that self-praising name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  Liberman puzzles me by counting the number of times I mention various names and terms, but to no purpose that I can see.  What is the significance of my mentioning Chomsky on some 30 pages, in a book about language and modern attitudes toward it?  What is the significance of my not mentioning &lt;em&gt;participle&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;phoneme&lt;/em&gt; even once?  I wasn’t writing a grammar or a textbook for Linguistics 001.   Liberman further puzzles me by quoting an explication of “progressive” by one Nate Silver, as if Silver’s personal usage explains the significance of the switch by so many sometime Liberals to the name “Progressives”, and why even people who strongly disagree with their views accept that name for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  Jamessal, having read my old &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; article, says that I (and Bryan Garner) fail to acknowledge “the shoddy state of real world prescriptivism.”  I believe he is wrong in thinking that Garner does not disavow, and strongly criticize, the kind of indignant-letter-to-the-editor prescriptivism that I think Jamessal has in mind; I know that he is wrong in thinking that of me.  I go to some pains in my book to make it clear that that kind of prescriptivism is something I deplore; so much so that I shy away from calling myself a prescriptivist, and instead call myself, whenever I can, a Linguistic Activist (Bill Safire’s term) — but this is something you learn only by reading the book.   Jamessal also gives us a classic example of begging the question when he says, in response to a rhetorical question of mine, that “this sort of speculating is best done by the people who know most about language and its history—linguists, of course.”   It is a major contention of my book that questions of usage — that is, of how we should use the language today — do not come within the professional purview of linguists.   Jamessal has every right to reject that argument, but he should not speak as if I never made it, and as if everyone “of course” acknowledged that linguists were the best authorities on how we should use language today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  James C. believes that in my book I “dump on” and “defame” the discipline of linguistics.  In fact my book is strongly critical of the main branch of modern linguistics, and of several particular linguists, but I deny that I have defamed either the discipline or its practitioners.  Desktop Assistant says in response to my query about the term &lt;em&gt;defame&lt;/em&gt;: “1. To damage the reputation, character, or good name of by slander or libel. See Synonyms at &lt;em&gt;malign&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.  Liberman and others make a total hash of my rhetorical question, “…what does language, undisturbed, become?  What course do we know it would take if only outsiders would cease to meddle with it?”  I was thinking, as readers of my book would know, of the claim often made by linguists that prescriptivists are meddling with a natural process, and should cease to interfere.  My question is directed to those linguists, asking them how they know what the natural course of language development is, and why the product of that process is to be preferred to one in which prescriptivists have a role.  And the extent to which the prescriptive impulse has been instrumental in the development of Sanskrit or any of the other languages mentioned is something no one knows with certainty, but we should have to think only of Pāṇini to remind ourselves that scholars have been codifying and regularizing language since history began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.  Jamessal considers that when Liberman said “nearly all the world’s languages, for nearly all of the history of the world, have been left to develop without prescriptive guidance,” he rendered my argument “totally bogus.”  This is misunderstanding brought to critical mass: first, as I noted above, Liberman doesn’t understand my argument; second, his own dogmatic statement about the development of nearly all languages throughout human history is breathtaking in its assumption of omniscience; and third, even if he were completely right, his &lt;em&gt;ipse dixit&lt;/em&gt; declaration would hardly render my argument even partially “bogus” — some contributors to this list seem to have a shaky grasp of the meaning of the words they use, like &lt;em&gt;defame&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bogus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.  Joseph Palmer made me laugh; he throws up his hands in despair and says “God only knows what Halpern is trying to say…”  No, Mr Palmer, God is not the only one who knows what I mean; any reasonably fair and attentive reader of my book quickly learns what I mean.  Try being such a reader; you may find it enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. I note that several of the contributors are angry with prescriptivists (and since they see me as just another one, with me) for attempting to “hand down rules from on high” and so on.  There may be such people, but I’m not one of them.  I take firm stands in my book on many points of usage, but I nowhere claim that I have a direct line to language heaven; I explicitly state that neither I nor anyone else is an authority on usage, and I always offer reasoned arguments in favor of the usages I recommend.  You are free of course to reject my arguments, but if you do so without offering better ones yourself, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the would-be dictator and dogmatist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.  I note with regret that no contributor to this discussion actually grapples with any of the arguments I offered in my book.  Even Mark Liberman, who thinks that there are some interesting ideas in the book, and says that he may discuss them on another occasion, doesn’t tackle any of them in the postings under discussion.  This is a shame; a chance has been missed by linguists and their supporters to expose the ignorance, irrationality, and general no-goodness of someone like me — one who is not even a forthright prescriptivist, but a cowardly camp-follower of prescriptivism who hides behind the name “linguistic activist”!  For example, I have had the temerity to attack the highly regarded essay by Language Log’s co-founder, Geoffrey Pullum, in which he destroyed the myth that Eskimo languages have more words for snow than do languages from the temperate zone.  Surely some contributors to the Log will want to examine my arguments, expose their hollowness, and vindicate the co-founder?  But whether they choose that part of my book or another as the weak point on which to mount an attack, why not grasp this wonderful opportunity to put prescriptivism in its place, along with flat-earthism, phlogiston, and other discredited notions?  Of course there is a price to be paid — anyone taking on the task would have to read the book — but in the defense of descriptivism, linguistics, and the American way, it may be worth paying even so heavy a price.&lt;/p&gt;

But together they tell their own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of the stimulus package&lt;/strong&gt; includes money for high-speed rail.  That’s good — if the government is going to be spending piles of money in an attempt to kick-start the economy, it would be nice to get something of lasting value in return, and mass transportation connecting distant cities is certainly of lasting value.  Of course opponents are playing politics with it, which is to be expected.  And here is their fun strategy:  to highlight on such proposed high-speed rail line, between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and label it the &lt;a href="http://michiganmessenger.com/13394/mccotter-and-the-mythical-sin-express"&gt;“Sin Express.”&lt;/a&gt;  Get it?  Real Americans don’t travel between those two dens of iniquity, only shady reprobates who want to divert stimulus dollars from hard-working blue-collar Midwesterners who would never step foot inside a shiny Vegas casino.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not even true — there is no money set aside for high-speed rail between LA and Vegas, and it’s not listed as a high priority on the Federal Railroad Administration’s list of &lt;a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/02/boehner_slams_mythical_vegas_hsr_project_ignores_ohio_rail_opportunity.php"&gt;officially designated high-speed rail corridors.&lt;/a&gt;  Which is too bad, as I’ve driven along several of those hypothetical routes, and the one between LA and Vegas is certainly one of the more useful places to plunk down some high-speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Jessica Valenti&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.feministing.com/archives/013806.html"&gt;“hook-up culture.”&lt;/a&gt;  In case you don’t know what that is, it’s a catchphrase invented by cultural conservatives who would like you to believe that kids today are disrespecting America’s Puritan heritage by having sex with each other.  And they may be right!  I suspect that some kids are having sex with each other.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/08/12/great-moments-in-framing/"&gt;Sex is fun.&lt;/a&gt;  But it is also something to be careful about, with possible unintended consequences ranging from emotional pain to disease to unplanned pregnancies.  So we might hope that responsible cultural conservatives would want to &lt;a href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/lord_saletans_house_o_compromise_with_new_salad_bar/"&gt;equip young men and women with the knowledge&lt;/a&gt; necessary to avoid those pitfalls while enjoying the fun parts of sex.  But that agenda seems to be well-hidden under a campaign to shame people, under the theory that other people having sex is a dirty and disgusting thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may have heard that Michael Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;, former paragon of American purity and might and speediness in water, has been uncovered as a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/sports/othersports/06phelps.html?_r=1"&gt;shocking moral degenerate&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently he intentionally inhaled the fumes from a slowly-burning psychoactive herb, funneled through some sort of device designed expressly for that purpose, while “chilling” with his “buds.”  Now all of his recent success at the Beijing Olympics must be called into question — how do we know that his fantastic performances in competitive swimming weren’t artificially aided by “toking” on a “doobie” before hopping in the pool?  Naturally, Phelps has been &lt;a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/really_though.php"&gt;suspended from competition&lt;/a&gt;, stripped of lucrative sponsorship deals, and forced to wear a sackcloth and ashes while parading around the town square with a giant scarlet “M” hanging around his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2009/02/01/a-letter-id-like-to-see-but-wont/"&gt;the letter Michael Phelps should have written&lt;/a&gt;.  If only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/poker/news/story?id=3829918&amp;amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;amp;source=poker"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/poker_annette_195.jpg" alt="Annette Obrestad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;This is Annette Obrestad&lt;/strong&gt; from Norway, one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Obrestad"&gt;best poker players in the world&lt;/a&gt;.  She is also a young woman, and a great role model for girls in what has traditionally been a boy’s game.  She burst on the scene when she was only 15 years old, winning online tournaments in Europe.  At the age of 18 she proved that her prowess extended to live play, winning $2 million by taking first place at the World Series of Poker Europe Main Event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Obrestad can’t legally play poker for money in the United States.  &lt;a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/poker/news/story?id=3829918&amp;amp;campaign=rsssrch&amp;amp;source=poker"&gt;She’s too young&lt;/a&gt;, and will have to wait another year until she turns 21.  You can join the army, or vote, or sign multi-million-dollar basketball contracts if you are 20 years old, but you can’t play poker for money.  (Michael Phelps participated in the 2000 Olympics at the age of 15.)  America is afraid of poker.  The &lt;a href="http://www.poker-strategy.org/default.aspx?tabid=191"&gt;Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act&lt;/a&gt;, smuggled through Congress in 2006, led many online poker sites to stop accepting money from U.S. players, no matter how old they are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what it is that makes America so puritanical, compared to Western Europe.  (It’s also substantially more religious, but the direction of the causal arrows is not clear.)  Hopefully we can scold the country into taking a more grown-up attitude toward sex, drugs, gambling — maybe even, someday, rock and roll.  A few more blog posts like this one should do it.&lt;/p&gt;

Reading over the comments, it seems to me that people were to some extent talking past one another. Such misunderstanding seems especially common in discussions of linguistic norms. So in a few paragraphs below, I've tried to explain how I, at least, think about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with discussions of linguistic style,  of linguistic form, of pronunciation, of word usage, and so on. No one objects to this (although the topic has become become oddly rare among literary scholars, suggesting some covert objections). Certainly,  linguists spend most of their time engaged in such discussions. And inevitably, these discussions are relative to the norms of some speech community or some written tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have explicit comparisons and evaluations of different norms. Again, no one objects to this, in general, unless the discussion involves falsehood (such as the notion that regional or social norms are anarchic masses of chaotic mistakes caused by failure to learn the rules of a standard language) or prejudice (such as unsupported claims that particular regional or social norms are objectively ugly or inefficient).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are apparently a few people out there who object to the whole notion of a standard written language, or believe that it's wrong to urge people to learn one;  but none of these people post on this site, as far as I know. (Some of our commenters may feel this way, I'm not sure.) At the other end of the spectrum, there are apparently some people who believe that all linguistic varieties that deviate from (someone's idea of) a  standard should be ruthlessly suppressed.  But most purveyors of usage advice, of whatever species, simply believe that the formal written language should be learned and used in certain contexts; and the disagreements are mostly about what those contexts are, and what the norms of that language should be taken to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least four different kinds of arguments that can be used in discussions of what linguistic norms are or should be: empirical arguments, logical arguments, arguments from authority, and experimental arguments. Nearly everyone involved in these discussions invokes arguments of all four types at one time or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The empirical investigation of the norms of usage, by reference to the way that people actually talk or write, has been the foundation of linguistic scholarship for centuries. The advent of computational methods in recent years has made this method easier and more powerful. It can be applied with equal ease and appropriateness to determining the norms of formal written English in 18th-century America, or the norms of the spoken French in contemporary working-class Montreal, or the norms of contemporary scientific English in refereed publications in computer science or epidemiology.  The instinct of most linguists, given a question about usage, is to use this method to see what the facts are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sometimes annoys certain people,  especially if the results disagree with their own instinct, or the pronouncements of some authority figure. So even if the cited evidence comes from the canonical texts of literature, politics, science and so on, you sometimes see silly arguments about the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005205.html"&gt;irrelevance of polls to truth&lt;/a&gt;,  or the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=515"&gt;license of great writers&lt;/a&gt; to break the rules prescribed for lesser beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Arguments from logic depend on developing a theory of what the patterns of (some variety of) language are, and applying this theory to contested cases.  If the theory is  wrong, then  the argument is nonsense.   If the theory is apparently correct, then further discussion ensues.  Is this an area where logical consistency should be expected to apply, or do we expect free variation? Are the deviations mistakes, or idiomatic exceptions, or instances of a different pattern entirely? Some of the arguments that we ridicule as "prescriptivist poppycock" are of this form, for example &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000288.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004268.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; on the other hand, I've often made arguments of this form myself, for example &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Arguments from authority are the easiest to construct. They&amp;#39;re valid if the authority&amp;#39;s statements are relevant and trustworthy; if not, not.  We often make arguments based on reference to dictionaries, because we  trust their scholarship — but this trust is provisional, not absolute, and we sometimes point out omissions, or apparent errors of others sorts, even in the best dictionaries.  Grammars and usage manuals are often a good source of evidence of types (1) and (2) above, and linguists often use them in that way, and cite them when we do. On the other hand, some grammars are mistaken or out-of-date, and some usage manuals are full of made-up or over-interpreted or absurdly vague &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot;, contradicted by valid evidence of other kinds.  Most instances of what we call &amp;quot;prescriptivist poppycock&amp;quot; are of this kind — a couple of examples are &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=523"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=515"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The fourth category of argument, involving a claim about the psychology of perception or production, most often appears in the form of an empty assertion, for example that something is &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005215.html"&gt;perniciously ambiguous&lt;/a&gt;. These assertions are almost never based on, or checked by, actual experiments, though they &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=199"&gt;could (and in my opinion should) be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a particular variant of the argument from authority — maybe it&amp;#39;s better to call it a meta-argument from authority — which starts with an observation that everyone agrees with, and then draws a conclusion that&amp;#39;s much more controversial. There&amp;#39;s an especially clear instance of this  on pp. 57-58 of Mark Halpern&amp;#39;s book Language and Human Nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;By &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; I don't mean &lt;em&gt;laws&lt;/em&gt;, such as those that linguists find in the history of sound changes. A grammatical &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt; is an edict intended to regulate writers (and to a lesser extent speakers) or English, not to discover what they have done or are doing; its aim is prescriptive, not descriptive. I'll use &lt;em&gt;laws&lt;/em&gt; when discussing the regularities found by linguists, &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; for the judgments laid down by grammarians. Some protest against rules, calling them &lt;em&gt;arbitrary&lt;/em&gt;; I can accept that description, but only with the understanding that &lt;em&gt;arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; does not in such a context mean &lt;em&gt;mindless, capricious,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;oppressive&lt;/em&gt;, it simply means a &lt;em&gt;convention&lt;/em&gt;, something that does not claim to have been dicovered in nature. It is instead a judgment or decision taken by some authority, declaring some form of behavior to be acceptable or not. it is almost always the result of much debate and balancing of equally desired but mutually exclusive goods — if it is arbitrary, it is so in a sense closely related to &lt;em&gt;arbitration&lt;/em&gt;: a way of resolving disputes on complex matters in such a way as to preserve civilization, which cannot survive with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The classic example from outside the linguistic world of a rule is the injunction to keep to the right when driving. We know that it is only a convention, but it is none the worse for that — it does sort us out on the road, and virtually eliminates the head-on collisions that would result from allowing drivers to decide for themselves, as free-born citizens, which side of the road they would keep to. If a critic were to protest this rule on the grounds that it was — in the bad sense — arbitrary, and that no objective grounds could be found for preferring the right to the left here, he would find little support; it is accepted universally that while it matters not at all whether we all keep to the right or the left, it matters a great deal that we all keep to the same side — and the rule accomplishes that, while not, so far as we can see, infringing on anyone&amp;#39;s rights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part of this that everyone agrees with is that linguistic norms are arbitrary, or at least have a large arbitrary component — for example, there&amp;#39;s no reason to think that the English Subject-Verb-Object order is better or worse than the Japanese Subject-Object-Verb order,  but it&amp;#39;s obviously useful for everyone to pick a word-order pattern and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part that&amp;#39;s controversial, to say the least, is the idea that establishing and maintaining such norms motivates or perhaps even requires the linguistic equivalent of legislatures, police, and courts. In fairness to Mark Halpern, he explicitly denies that he means for state power to be applied to these questions — he just wants lexicographers, editors, teachers, and others to try to enforce (what he feels are) the proper standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among different groups at different places and times, we can see linguistic norms developing as various mixtures of emergent or natural order, explicit analysis and discussion, and formally constituted authority. Some people seem to think that no worthwhile linguistic system is possible without the systematic intervention of explicit authority — but it&amp;#39;s hard to square this view with examples like the development of Elizabethan English. Other people seem to think that no attempts to impose explicit authority over linguistic norms are ever at all effective — but this is inconsistent with various documented successes of language planning, not to speak of the many examples of extreme diglossia created by the long-term maintenance of admired antique norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the people who post here generally have a sensible understanding of the issues, and a reasonable perspective that avoids the absurdities of various extreme views. But then, you'd expect me to think that, wouldn't you?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the image is almost certainly an artifact of the mapping process.  The underwater images for Google’s &lt;em&gt;ocean maps&lt;/em&gt; come from multiple sonar measurements of the ocean floor.  (Unlike &lt;em&gt;Google Earth&lt;/em&gt; which relies on satellite imagery to show the surface only.)  The area in question was mapped by boats travelling in a series of straight lines, and the “grid” merely shows the route taken by those mapping boats.  A &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1150846/Atlantis-revealed--just-load-old-Googles.html"&gt;spokeswoman for Google has been quoted&lt;/a&gt; in numerous places:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…what users are seeing is an artifact of the data collection process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bathymetric (sea-floor) data is often collected from boats using sonar to take measurements of the sea-floor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;The lines reflect the path of the boat as it gathers the data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even without this information, it seems extremely unlikely this was ever an underwater city.  A city the “size of Wales”?  From this &lt;a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/europe/lgcolor/ukwcolor.htm"&gt;map of Wales&lt;/a&gt; you can see that would be approximately 130 by 70 miles in size - some city.  And using a ruler to make some rough calculations, those roads would be at least a couple of miles wide.  They must have been expecting some pretty heavy traffic over ten thousand years ago!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235315207394"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/best_pro-vaccine_commercial_ever.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4c9568a266f3dc1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Television"/><title type="html">Best pro-vaccine commercial ever?</title><published>2009-02-22T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-22T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/ruzgjJpQDwo/best_pro-vaccine_commercial_ever.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/best_pro-vaccine_commercial_ever.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://ontario.ca/mumps"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, because in my current state I need a good laugh right about now.

&lt;p&gt;We went to the &lt;a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/"&gt;Monterey Bay Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; yesterday but, owing to the whims of the kids we were with (our own plus some friends), I didn't get to spend the hours I usually like to spend staring at jellies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I was able to park myself in front of a single tank of jellies for maybe 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the tank contained &lt;a href="http://www.mbayaq.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx?enc=bvtrZdF4EV3pikt3wsgcLw=="&gt;sea nettles&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Chrysaora fuscescens&lt;/i&gt;), jellies which are fairly gorgeous and hypnotic.  It didn't quite make up for the oppressively loud background music piped into too many of the exhibits, but it gave me a brief interval of awe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/sea_nettles.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/sea_nettles.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/p1QVR9PAtmk" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235310229090"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=443">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/11a4a963ea43bbe7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">The SGU Website and the Rogues Gallery Update</title><published>2009-02-22T13:14:37Z</published><updated>2009-02-22T13:14:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=443" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your patience while we upgrade the SGU website. There have been a few hiccups while we move the site to a new host and completely update the site itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it seems as if we have identified all of the major problems - you should no longer be getting that annoying error message when you try to access the site. You can download new episodes from the homepage and each episode from its archive page. The contact-us page works. All the critical functions work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the site is still very much a work in progress. The podcast players still needs to be fixed. There are also small bugs that keep cropping up - if you encounter any, please let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - as our listeners use the site we will get a better handle on its real functionality. We therefore expect to make design and function changes with the experience of real world use. Again this means that feedback from all of you is critical. If you want us to make a change, and it makes sense and is feasible, the chances are actually pretty good that we will make the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rogues Gallery itself has gone through a rough patch. It was down for a week, and now Bob, Jay and I are coming off a one week vacation - hence the paucity of new posts. But we should be back to a full schedule starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the regular posters - the Rogues, including Mike Lacelle who runs the SGU fans site and frequently appears on 5×5 - we need to expand our contributors. We never replaced Jon Blumenfeld, who had to stop blogging due to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are going to do is publish guest submissions by our listeners. So, if you ever wanted to try your hand at blogging, or if you already are a blogger and want to show your stuff in a new venue - send us your entries. We will edit and publish the best of our submissions here. You can e-mail them to roguesgallery@theskepticsguide.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Jay and Jeremy and all their volunteers  for all the hard work they have put and continue to put into the site.  We deeply appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next is theness.com website. This is way overdue for an overhaul, and we have lots of ideas about how we can use this site to bring more skeptical content to the web. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235303101130"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_212.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90c6ee164081571c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-02-22T09:14:31Z</published><updated>2009-02-22T09:14:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/oFmLSIps-9w/clock_quotes_212.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_212.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a nation which has an almost evil reputation for bustle, bustle, bustle, and rush, rush, rush, we spend an enormous amount of time standing around in line in front of windows, just waiting. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Disability advocates (including Dora and me) have been protesting the choice of Lewis: Here is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/petition_to_protest_hersholt_award_choice"&gt;Dora's post&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/jlno2009/petition.html"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; to protest giving Lewis this award. As Dora wrote, it's Lewis' "perpetuation of pity instead of respect for people with disabilities" in his (in)famous &lt;a href="http://www.mda.org/telethon/"&gt;muscular dystrophy telethon&lt;/a&gt; that makes the choice of him to receive the Hersholt Award inappropriate. You can read &lt;a href="http://www.ragged-edge-mag.com/archive/jerry92.htm"&gt;A Test of Wills: Jerry Lewis, Jerry's Orphans, and the Telethon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.ragged-edge-mag.com/archive/jerry92.htm"&gt;Ragged Edge&lt;/a&gt; about the "stigma against disabled people" reinforced in Lewis' telethon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it's not unusual to hear about celebrities using their, well, celebrity to "bring attention to a worthy cause" and grace fundraisers and "evenings out with the stars." And they need not be all of the Jenny McCarthy sort: The likes of Tom Brokaw and Sheri Belafonte are being touted as part of a crew of 36 celebrities who, along with artist Steve Saylor, are to raise money and awareness and "shed light on the disorder," via efforts by &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29286876/"&gt; Nevada's First Lady Dawn Gibbons and the Nevada Coalition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond "drawing attention," what do celebrities do for causes? In today's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/magazine/22wwln-q4-t.html?ref=books"&gt;New York Times magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Dambisa Moyo is interviewed. A native of Zambia, she is about to publish a book entitled "Dead Aid" in which she attacks " aid to Africa and its recent glamorization by celebrities." Says Moyo about Bono in an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/magazine/22wwln-q4-t.html?ref=books"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll make a general comment about this whole dependence on “celebrities.” I object to this situation as it is right now where they have inadvertently or manipulatively become the spokespeople for the African continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as rockstars and others have "inadvertently or manipulatively become the spokespeople for the African continent," it can be argued that various celebrities (some of whom do have children on the autism spectrum) have "inadvertently or manipulatively become the spokespeople" for autism, instead of individuals on the spectrum themselves. Too often, as in the case of Lewis' telethon, individuals with disabilities are portrayed as in need of pity and help---including help representing themselves---and the public is enjoined to show their compassion by providing their credit card number. Often, the stated goal is to "fund research"---certainly a "worthy cause."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been so many reports lately about the use of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_3_against_physical_restraints_amp_padded_rooms"&gt;physical restraints and seclusion&lt;/a&gt; for students on the autism spectrum and the apparent ignorance of some school districts about how best to respond to students when in distress (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/tased_at_school"&gt;tasing&lt;/a&gt; is just not an option). School districts everywhere (my own included---Charlie's teacher told me that no one's allowed to order any new supplies) are facing budget cuts: What about talking up ways to help schools create programs for students on the spectrum and provide necessary services like speech therapy, occupational therapy, and adapted physical education? And sufficient staffing, and sufficient and continued training for staff? And don't get me started about the needs of housing, job-training, transportation, and much more for adults with disabilities who need such supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about ending restraints and seclusion for students is the furthest thing from "sexy," I'll acknowledge. But surely speaking up to end these is truly a humanitarian act, and, indeed, one worthy of an award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Awareness" is great, but, unless it's turned into real and actual action that affects real and actual people, it's just a start.&lt;/p&gt;

Both father and son are members of the Woodward Street Church where it's no secret that Harry Collins runs a tight ship as an active and devoted member of the church and father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"I got on my son for talking like an atheist." &lt;/span&gt; said Harry. What Timothy did was make reference to it being a fortunate turn of events that a mountain had formed nearby. A big, bearded Harry, being a photographer, was capturing an image of a beautiful tree-covered mountainside. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"And my son made it sound like the mountain was 'just there.' That's atheist talk, and it won't be permitted in my home."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being slightly puzzled, a bright young Timothy clarified his father's position for us: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"My dad got mad at me because I made it sound like mountains 'just are.' But nothing 'just is.' As Christians, we are forced to believe that everything that happens happens for a purpose. All things are made of God, from the design of curvitures running along the deepest sea floors to the arrangement of obscure dust particles on the dark side of the moon. My dad was right to get on me. The secular public schools teach a lot of wrong and evil things, and look how they have influenced my thinking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"It's ok, son."&lt;/span&gt; Harry said, nodding with approval at his son's words, and then continuing: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"The secular schools are full of atheists who profess themselves to be wise, but are fools. They think they are smarter than God. Think about how atheists perceive a mountain; to an atheist, a mountain is just a bunch of dirt that got pushed up when things got steaming hot under the earth's surface, causing a raising up of the ground. And that the mountain is 'tall' means nothing to an atheist because atheists think 'tall' is just a perceptual difference and that the mountain isn't really big or little. Everything is relative to an atheist. They have no objective standards. We Christians happen to know that God made all things purposely and according to his will, and in the case of mountains, he made them so that we could be impressed with their size and marvel at his creative power (Psalm 65:5). This was the same reason he created big, worthless planets and put them in orbit in space (Psalm 19:1-6). They don't do anything, but God wanted us to get smart and build telescopes and look up at the sky and say, 'Wow, those are big! God must be great!' And without mountains, how could Moses have gone up to Mt. Horeb to speak to God and get the ten commandments? So there is another reason why God made mountains."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jumping in, young Timothy said: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"And the Lord has revealed to me a third reason for why God made mountains. It was so that Jesus could mention it in Matthew 21:21 where Jesus said: 'Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.'" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazed, Harry said: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"That's my boy! I sure am proud of him. He's no atheist, that's for sure! But the lesson to take from this is how atheism is never very far from invading our thinking the moment we start to use our minds. That's how atheism starts - with us thinking of natural reasons for why things happen - and then it progresses to making people say things like this or that 'always was' or 'just is.' And when you have a natural explanation for something, tell me, why do you need a supernatural one? What need is there for God once you've explained the world naturally?" &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"Atheists think that the matter composing the universe just is and has always been while we believers understand that you have to go back one more step and say that God -- an unknown phantom spook -- just is and has always been. That's the true position; God created everything and everything needs a creator except for God. He just exists all by himself some way. That's how Christians reason, and that's how God wants us to reason. Stay away from secular reasoning. It will only lead to atheism and then to Hell. It is an unfortunate fact that using the brains God gave us to reason with can send us to burn forever. So try not to reason, except perhaps when reason agrees with the Bible. Then it's ok."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(JH)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

So, I gave up looking and assumed there wasn't one. And that was true - until recently. Last night at the meetup, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/U00A17A6B/profile" title=""&gt;Nikola Trbovic&lt;/a&gt; told me there is one now - opened just last June: &lt;a href="http://www.kafananyc.com/" title=""&gt;Kafana&lt;/a&gt; on Avenue C (between 8th and 9th Street, see reviews &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/kafana-new-york" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.menupages.com/restaurantdetails?restaurantid=53335" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, tonight, after watching the amazing &lt;a href="http://www.augustonbroadway.com/" title=""&gt;August: Osage County&lt;/a&gt; on Broadway, The Bride Of Coturnix and I went to 'Kafana' to give it a try. And we were not disappointed - the atmosphere was pleasant and the food was great - just like home. Under the fold are some pictures: Cocta ("drink of our and your youth" - rosehip-based Cola), Gibanica (philo-dough cheese pie), Zeljanica (spinach pie), pecene paprike (baked peppers), ajvar (a pepper salad mix), Sopska salata (tomato, cucumber, onion and cheese salad), &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/01/how_to_fix_an_authentic_serbia.php" title=""&gt;Sarma&lt;/a&gt; (stuffed cabbage), Karadjordjeva snicla (a thin pork steak, rolled with cream cheese, breaded) with cabage salad, and Niksicko pivo (the best Montenegran lager), ending with Reform torte, espresso and a bite of popular "Best Wishes" chocolate:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_one_and_onnly_serbian_rest.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_one_and_onnly_serbian_rest.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/QnCLVQ1Li0I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235283887896"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/74882590c88ee98b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Randi.org Undergoing Maintenance</title><published>2009-02-22T06:06:30Z</published><updated>2009-02-22T06:06:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/444-randiorg-undergoing-maintenance.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good news!

Our whole family has been enjoying many of the games together. But, as much as it can really be a great activity during some much needed “family time”, the Wii seemed to be dominating much of the recent weekend afternoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a couple of weekends ago, we took the family and one of the kids’ playmates to a favorite sledding area. We had plenty of snow, and the spot has enough of a slope to make about a 50-foot sled run (perfect for those little saucer-type sleds and dimestore inner-tubes). The kids had a blast all afternoon. Heck, despite the associated work of careful preparation for such an afternoon, even mom and dad had a blast. Here’s a brief account of just one of many memorable moments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After everyone had taken several turns on the sled, (including mom and dad)  and trudged their way back to the top for a brief rest before the next run, our autistic son had a specific request. He seemed pretty excited, and basically shouted it out:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I want three-player!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The meaining was crystal clear. Within a few seconds, mom took her spot on the tube, he hopped into her lap, and little brother ran over and jumped on top face down, clinging like Spiderman. Away they went, all three, and all within about 15 seconds of the initial request.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom, and upon gently coming to a stop, both boys rolled off, stood up, and voiced their approval of the event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Yay!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yay!” indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few more memorable moments (in visual form).&lt;/p&gt;

As you may recall, the point of the last review was to analyze the claim that Gould called for the overthrow of the Modern Synthesis or linked punctuated equilibria with saltationist mechanisms.  We may ask the same things about the paper from 1982, though I hope that such will not be the only use of this post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To begin with, here is the summary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The essence of Darwinism lies in the claim that natural selection is a creative force, and in the reductionist assertion that selection upon individual organisms is the locus of evolutionary change. Critiques of adaptationism and gradualism call into doubt the traditional consequences of the argument for creativity, while a concept of hierarchy, with selection acting upon such higher-level "individuals" as demes and species, challenges the reductionist claim. An expanded hierarchical theory would not be Darwinism, as strictly defined, but it would capture, in abstract form, the fundamental feature of Darwin's vision--direction of evolution by selection at each level.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, the point, more or less as with Gould (1980), is to question what he views as the exclusivity of adaptationism, gradualism, and reductionism inherent in the Modern Synthesis and to make a claim that an expanded, hierarchical theoretical approach is required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a Gouldian (i.e., somewhat esoteric and not terribly relevant, though brief) introduction, the paper continues through eight different sections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;What is Darwinism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meaning and appropriateness of the term "Darwinism" remain the subject of debate.  I side with &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/n47h34357743w4p0/?p=b92eaf8c7a5a4eccb52f94dde6cb99ee&amp;amp;pi=1"&gt;Scott and Branch (2009)&lt;/a&gt;, who argue that the term is misleading and easily misused, and should never be taken as synonymous with "modern evolutionary theory".  &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/jerry-coyne-on-darwinism.html"&gt;Others disagree&lt;/a&gt;, especially those who believe that not that much has changed since the Modern Synthesis -- nor needs to.  (Creationists are particularly enamored with this term because it allows them to portray evolution as an ideology based on the views of a single individual -- another very good reason to avoid endorsing it if its use provides no countervailing benefit).  If anything, the term should be used only in a specific context, namely in reference to Darwin's own views.  This is how many historians use the term.  However, even this narrow usage is not without challenges. As Gould notes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Although "Darwinism" has often been equated with evolution itself in popular literature, the term should be restricted to the body of thought allied with Darwin's own theory of mechanism, his second goal. This decision does not provide an unambiguous definition, if only because Darwin himself was a pluralist who granted pride of place to natural selection, but also advocated an important role for Lamarckian and other nonselectionist factors. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Gould then defines "Darwinism", which he will argue is incomplete and requires "expansion", as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If we agree, as our century generally has, that "Darwinism" should be restricted to the world view encompassed by the theory of natural selection itself, the problem of definition is still not easily resolved. Darwinism must be more than the bare bones of the mechanics: the principles of superfecundity and inherited variation, and the deduction of natural selection therefrom. It must, fundamentally, make a claim for wide scope and dominant frequency; natural selection must represent the primary directing force of evolutionary change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gould suggests that there are two central claims in this view: 1) Natural selection is a primarily creative process, and 2) selection occurs at the level of organisms within populations.  He spends time discussing them in sequence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;1) The creativity of natural selection.&lt;/span&gt; Darwinians cannot simply claim that natural selection operates since everyone, including Paley and the natural theologians, advocated selection as a device for removing unfit individuals at both extremes and preserving, intact and forever, the created type. The essence of Darwinism lies in a claim that natural selection is the primary directing force of evolution, in that it creates fitter phenotypes by differentially preserving, generation by generation, the best adapted organisms from a pool of random variants that supply raw material only, not direction itself. Natural selection is a creator; it builds adaptation step by step.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus defined, Gould then points out what he sees as three assumptions made by Darwinism in terms of the nature of variation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;It must be copious&lt;/span&gt; since selection makes nothing directly and requires a large pool of raw material. (ii) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;It must be small in scope&lt;/span&gt;. If new species characteristically arise all at once, then the fit are formed by the process of variation itself, and natural selection only plays the negative role of executioner for the unfit. True saltationist theories have always been considered anti-Darwinian on this basis. (iii) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;It must be undirected&lt;/span&gt;. If new environments can elicit heritable, adaptive variation, then creativity lies in the process of variation, and selection only eliminates the unfit. Lamarckism is an anti-Darwinian theory because it advocates directed variation; organisms perceive felt needs, adapt their bodies accordingly, and pass these modifications directly to offspring. [Emphasis added].&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He also points out two additional points that he considers part of classical Darwinian evolution, though these "are not absolute prerequisites or necessary deductive consequences":&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Gradualism&lt;/span&gt;. If creativity resides in a step-by-step process of selection from a pool of random variants, then evolutionary change must be dominantly continuous and descendants must be linked to ancestors by a long chain of smoothly intermediate phenotypes. ...  (ii) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The adaptationist program&lt;/span&gt;. If selection becomes creative by superintending, generation by generation, the continuous incorporation of favorable variation into altered forms, then evolutionary change must be fundamentally adaptive. If evolution were saltational, or driven by internally generated biases in the direction of variation, adaptation would not be a necessary attribute of evolutionary change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, here again Gould mentions saltationism, specifically as a challenge to adaptationism (and, obviously, gradualism).  There is no doubt that he was interested in this as a possible mechanism, though in 1980 this was largely in reference to the origin of basic forms of new innovations -- for example, the origin of jaws from gill arches through developmental mutations.  He does not go into details at this point in the 1982 paper, but there is no mention that saltationism is part of punctuated equilibria here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As in 1980, though much more briefly, he points out that proponents of narrow-sense Darwinism do not rule out mechanisms other than gradual adaptation but that they relegate these to exceptions of minor importance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then on to the second central claim:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;2) Selection operates through the differential reproductive success of individual organisms&lt;/span&gt; (the "struggle for existence" in Darwin's terminology). Selection is an interaction among individuals; there are no higher-order laws in nature, no statements about the "good" of species or ecosystems. If species survive longer, or if ecosystems appear to display harmony and balance, these features arise as a by-product of selection among individuals for reproductive success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a primary consequence, this focus upon individual organisms leads to reductionism, not to ultimate atoms and molecules of course, but of higher-order, or macroevolutionary, processes to the accumulated struggles of individuals. Extrapolationism is the other side of the same coin--the claim that natural selection within local populations is the source of all important evolutionary change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To summarize, Gould defines a specific intepretation of evolution based the primacy of natural selection, and identifies what he considers its main claims and assumptions.  These include the creative role of selection; the occurrence of ubiquitous, undirected, and incremental variation; gradual transformation over time, the main outcome of which is adaptation; and the emphasis on organisms in populations as the only important level of selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This section recounts Gould's view that the Modern Synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s (which united Mendelian inheritance and Darwinian natural selection) began as relatively pluralistic but later hardened around an adaptationist core (see &lt;a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_modern-synthesis.html"&gt;Gould 1983&lt;/a&gt; for a full discussion).  In this paper, as in 1980, he quotes a summary of the synthesis by Mayr (this time Mayr 1980):&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "evolutionary synthesis" was introduced by Julian Huxley ... to designate the general acceptance of two conclusions: gradual evolution can be explained in terms of small genetic changes ("mutations") and recombination, and the ordering of this genetic variation by natural selection; and the observed evolutionary phenomena, particularly macroevolutionary processes and speciation, can be explained in a manner that is consistent with the known genetic mechanisms.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Mayr 1980, p.1].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I might interject another (in my opinion, remarkable) quote of Mayr's in the preface to the 1998 reprint of the same book:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In a way, the synthesis was nothing but a confirmation of Darwin's original theory, even though Darwin had published prior to the development of genetics and cytology, and had been forced to treat the origin of variation as a black box.  His basic theory, that evolutionary change is due to the combination of variation and selection, was, however, completely sound and is daily confirmed by every evolutionist.  This basic principle of Darwinism is as solid at the end of the twentieth century as it was in 1850, untouched by all the advances made by evolutionary biology and other branches of biology in the intervening years. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Mayr 1998, p.xiii]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I say "remarkable" because it is indeed astounding that Darwin's basic idea of natural selection has survived so well in the face of 150 years of research.  With that I certainly agree.  However, it would also be remarkable if, by this paragraph, Mayr meant to claim that not much else has been added to evolutionary theory beyond natural selection.  (I notice that several years ago I wrote in the margin beside this quote, simply, "Wow").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back to Gould.  After quoting Mayr's assessment, he argues that he is not erecting a straw man and that it actually does represent the main thrust of the synthesis.  Also of note, he argues against attempts to re-brand the synthesis to incorporate new findings such that they are not seen as challenges:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The modern synthesis has sometimes been so broadly construed, usually by defenders who wish to see it as fully adequate to meet and encompass current critiques, that it loses all meaning by including everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Obviously, defining what the Modern Synthesis actually is will be important in current discussions about whether it needs expanding.  Specifically, it is important to determine whether the "Modern Synthesis" has already been transforming gradually to incorporate all new discoveries -- and if so, whether or at what point it no longer warrants description by the same name.  Even anagenetic change can, at some point, be said to have led to a novel species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is Happening to Darwinism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a brief section that lays out the crux of the claim being made.  Here it is in full.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Current critics of Darwinism and the modern synthesis are proposing &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;a good deal more than a comfortable extension of the theory, but much less than a revolution.&lt;/span&gt; In my partisan view, neither of Darwinism's two central themes will survive in their strict formulation; in that sense, "the modern synthesis, as an exclusive proposition, has broken down on both of its fundamental claims". However, I believe that a restructured evolutionary theory will embody the essence of the Darwinian argument in a more abstract, and hierarchically extended form. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The modern synthesis is incomplete, not incorrect.&lt;/span&gt; [Emphasis added].&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Critique of Creativity: Gradualism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this section, Gould clearly identifies the target of his criticism -- it is not natural selection, but exclusive assumptions regarding gradualism and adaptationism:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At issue is not the general idea that natural selection can act as a creative force; the basic argument, in principle, is a sound one. Primary doubts center on the subsidiary claims--gradualism and the adaptationist program. If most evolutionary changes, particularly large-scale trends, include major nonadaptive components as primary directing or channeling features, and if they proceed more in an episodic than a smoothly continuous fashion, then we inhabit a different world from the one Darwin envisaged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Critiques of gradualist thought proceed on different levels and have different import, but none are fundamentally opposed to natural selection. They are therefore not directed against the heart of Darwinian theory, but against a fundamental subsidiary aspect of Darwin's own world view--one that he consistently conflated with natural selection, as in the following famous passage: "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down". &lt;/blockquote&gt;He then brings up saltationism for the second time:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At the levels of microevolution and speciation, the &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;extreme saltationist claim that new species arise all at once, fully formed, by a fortunate macromutation would be anti-Darwinian, but no serious thinker now advances such a view&lt;/span&gt;, and neither did Richard Goldschmidt, the last major scholar to whom such an opinion is often attributed. Legitimate claims range from the saltational origin of key features by developmental shifts of dissociable segments of ontogeny  to the origin of reproductive isolation (speciation) by major and rapidly incorporated genetic changes that precede the acquisition of adaptive, phenotypic differences. [Emphasis added].&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Once again, Gould does not claim radical macromutations cause speciation (let alone that they are the mechanism of punctuated equilibria).  As in 1980, he cites "saltationist" processes in two particular contexts: 1) developmental mutations of large impact that are involved in the emergence of new innovations, 2) chromosomal mutations causing reproductive isolation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He goes on:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Are such styles of evolution anti-Darwinian? What can one say except "yes and no." They do not deny a creative role to natural selection, but neither do they embody the constant superintending of each event, or the step-by-step construction of each major feature, that traditional views about natural selection have advocated. If new Bauplane often arise in an adaptive cascade following the saltational origin of a key feature, then part of the process is sequential and adaptive, and therefore Darwinian; but the initial step is not, since selection does not play a creative role in building the key feature. If reproductive isolation often precedes adaptation, then a major aspect of speciation is Darwinian (for the new species will not prosper unless it builds distinctive adaptations in the sequential mode), but its initiation, including the defining feature of reproductive isolation, is not. &lt;/blockquote&gt;The main point here is that "saltationism" (in the two contexts he invokes it) undermines standard interpretations because it allows non-adaptive changes to play a major role before adaptive processes take over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Punctuated equilibria makes its first appearance in the next section.  As with the 1980 article, it is mentioned in the context of discussions about macroevolutionary trends produced by species selection. Here is the full section:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At the macroevolutionary level of trends, the theory of punctuated equilibrium proposes that established species generally do not change substantially in phenotype over a lifetime that may encompass many million years (stasis), and that most evolutionary change is concentrated in geologically instantaneous events of branching speciation. These geological instants, resolvable in favorable stratigraphic circumstances (so that the theory can be tested for its proposed punctuations as well as for its evident periods of stasis), represent amounts of microevolutionary time fully consistent with orthodox views about speciation. Indeed, Eldredge and I originally proposed punctuated equilibrium as the expected geological consequence of Mayr's theory of peripatric speciation. The non-Darwinian implications of punctuated equilibrium lie in its suggestions for the explanation of evolutionary trends (see below), not in the tempo of individual speciation events. Although punctuated equilibrium is a theory for a higher level of evolutionary change, and must therefore be agnostic with respect to the role of natural selection in speciation, the world that it proposes is quite different from that traditionally viewed by paleontologists (and by Darwin himself) as the proper geological extension of Darwinism. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Gould concludes this section by pointing out that the debate between gradualism and punctuationism is not about natural selection, but about the larger patterns of change.  Specifically, in admittedly "ridiculously oversimplifed" terms, whether change is "constant" or "difficult" as a phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Critique of Creativity: Adaptation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The message of this part of the essay will be familiar to Gould's readers: not everything is an adaptation.  (If I may, I would argue that "Not everything is an adaptation" should be one of the most commonly emphasized lines in evolution courses, up there with "Organisms do not evolve, populations do").  Gould cites neutral molecular evolution and developmental constraints as counterpoints to adaptationism.  He also notes that current function may not provide much information regarding historical origin, for example because of co-option.  He recognizes that these can be interpreted in adaptationist terms, for example if past adaptations determine constraints and if co-option merely involves a shift from one adaptative function to another.  However, as Gould and Vrba (1982) subsequently pointed out (he cites that paper here as in press), non-adaptive features can also be exapted.  As usual, it is a question of relative frequency.  As he says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolutionists admit, of course, that all selection yields by-products and incidental consequences, but we tend to think of these nonadaptations as a sort of evolutionary frill, a set of small and incidental modifications with no major consequences. I dispute this assessment and claim that the pool of nonadaptations must be far greater in extent than the direct adaptations that engender them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gould closes this section by repeating that he is not challenging natural selection, only strict adaptationism:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not claim that a new force of evolutionary change has been discovered. Selection may supply all immediate direction, but if highly constraining channels are built of nonadaptations, and if evolutionary versatility resides primarily in the nature and extent of nonadaptive pools, then "internal" factors of organic design are an equal partner with selection. We say that mutation is the ultimate source of variation, yet we grant a fundamental role to recombination and the evolution of sexuality--often as a prerequisite to multicellularity, the Cambrian explosion and, ultimately, us. Likewise, selection may be the ultimate source of evolutionary change, but most actual events may owe more of their shape to its nonadaptive sequelae. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Is Evolution a Product of Selection Among Individuals?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As noted in the abstract, one of Gould's major arguments is that evolutionary theory should undergo an expansion to include a hierarchical outlook.  This includes natural selection as a primary mechanism, but one that takes place at several levels:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the traditional Darwinian focus on individual bodies, and the attendant reductionist account of macroevolution, will be supplanted by a hierarchical approach recognizing legitimate Darwinian individuals at several levels of a structural hierarchy, including genes, bodies, demes, species, and clades.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He briefly mentions the idea of "selfish DNA", which provides a convincing example of selection within genomes.  I agree (Gregory 2004, 2005).  Species selection is more complex, but one of the basic requirements is that it must be possible to view species as "individuals" with births, lifespans, differential reproduction, and deaths.  It is here that punctuated equilibria comes in, because it provides species with a comparatively short "gestation" and birth, a potentially long lifespan of relative stasis, differential production of daughter species by cladogenesis, and finally extinction.  As Gould states:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If new species usually arose by the smooth transformation of an entire ancestral species, and then changed continuously toward a descendant form, they would lack the stability and coherence required for defining evolutionary individuals. The theory of punctuated equilibrium allows us to individuate species in both time and space; this property (rather than the debate about evolutionary tempo) may emerge as its primary contribution to evolutionary theory. &lt;/blockquote&gt;He then points out that having the properties of "individuals" does not guarantee species selection.  Indeed, there was substantial debate among macroevolutionary theorists about what would count as species selection and what could be reduced to organism-level selection (e.g., Vrba 1983, 1989; Lloyd and Gould 1993).  Nevertheless, he argues:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We need not, however, confine ourselves to the simple fact of individuation as an argument against Darwinian reductionism. For the strong claim that higher-level individuals act as units of selection in their own right can often be made. Many evolutionary trends, for example, are driven by differential frequency of speciation (the analog of birth) rather than by differential extinction (the more usual style of selection by death). Features that enhance the frequency of speciation are often properties of populations, not of individual organisms, for example, dependence of dispersal (and resultant possibilities for isolation and speciation) on size and density of populations. &lt;/blockquote&gt;There has been quite a bit written about population- and species-level properties, including their heritability, since this paper (e.g., Jablonski 1987; Hunt et al. 2005).  Still, the main point is clear enough. There are also shades of the distinction between "sorting" (a pattern of differential survival and reproduction) and "selection" (one cause of sorting), which was introduced more explicitly later (Gould and Vrba 1986).  Finally, Gould responds to some common criticisms of species selection as an important phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Evolutionary Pattern by Interaction Between Levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gould notes that a hierarchical approach would not imply that all levels are disconnected from one another.  Rather, interactions among levels might be responsible for some of the patterns that are seen:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The hierarchical model, with its assertion that selection works simultaneously and differently upon individuals at a variety of levels, suggests a revised interpretation for many phenomena that have puzzled people where they implicitly assumed causation by selection upon organisms. In particular, it suggests that negative interaction between levels might be an important principle in maintaining stability or holding rates of change within reasonable bounds. &lt;/blockquote&gt;He once again mentions "selfish DNA", which shows interaction between intragenomic and organism-level selection.  He also brings up "overspecialization", in which adaptation that results from organism-level selection can lead to shorter species longevity.  (For a recent example, see Van Valkenburgh et al. 2004).  In addition to antagonism between levels, Gould proposes that sometimes selection on more than one level can lead to, and enhance, the same result.  Finally, he suggests that sometimes a feature can be subject to selection at a higher level that is not impeded at the lower level, thereby making it widespread among extant lineages (such as sexual reproduction, which delays extinction and accelerates speciation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He concludes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We live in a world with reductionist traditions, and do not react comfortably to notions of hierarchy. Hierarchical theories permit us to retain the value of traditional ideas, while adding substantially to them. They traffic in accretion, not substitution. If we abandoned the "either-or" mentality that has characterized arguments about units of selection, we would not only reduce fruitless and often acrimonious debate, but we would also gain a deeper understanding of nature's complexity through the concept of hierarchy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;A Higher Darwinism?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final section of the essay highlights Gould's notion of a hierarchical theory, which he says is neither a minor extension of standard theory nor a revolution.  This is because it is not a simple addition to selection at the organism level, but neither does it invoke any new general mechanisms.  It is a matter expanding the application of well-understood processes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What would a fully elaborated, hierarchically based evolutionary theory be called? It would neither be Darwinism, as usually understood, nor a smoothly continuous extension of Darwinism, for it violates directly the fundamental reductionist tradition embodied in Darwin's focus on organisms as units of selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... the hierarchically based theory would not be Darwinism as traditionally conceived; it would be both a richer and a different theory. But it would embody, in abstract form, the essence of Darwin's argument expanded to work at each level. Each level generates variation among its individuals; evolution occurs at each level by a sorting out among individuals, with differential success of some and their progeny. The hierarchical theory would therefore represent a kind of "higher Darwinism," with the substance of a claim for reduction to organisms lost, but the domain of the abstract "selectionist" style of argument extended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, selection will work differently on the objects of diverse levels. The phenomena of one level have analogs on others, but not identical operation. For example, we usually deny the effectiveness of mutation pressure at the level of organisms. Populations contain so many individuals that small biases in mutation rate can rarely establish a feature if it is under selection at all. But the analog of mutation pressure at the species level, directed speciation (directional bias toward certain phenotypes in derived species), may be a powerful agent of evolutionary trends (as a macroevolutionary alternative to species selection). Directed speciation can be effective (where mutation pressure is not) for two reasons: first, because its effects are not so easily swamped (given the restricted number of species within a clade) by differential extinction; second, because such phenomena as ontogenetic channeling in phyletic size increase suggest that biases in the production of species may be more prevalent than biases in the genesis of mutations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each level must be approached on its own, and appreciated for the special emphasis it places upon common phenomena, but the selectionist style of argument regulates all levels and the Darwinian vision is extended and generalized, not defeated, even though Darwinism, strictly constructed, may be superseded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He closes by quoting and praising Darwin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what can we take away from the essay?  In my reading, Gould is arguing for a revision to what he considers a narrow view of Darwinian processes.  There is no call for revolution, though his hierarchical view is more than a simple tweaking of the synthesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are in a similar position today, I think.  There are many mechanisms that extend beyond the borders of the theory developed 70 years ago.  However, the basics of the synthesis are solid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is whether these new phenomena can be included in something that would still reasonably be called the "Modern Synthesis", or whether we should recognize another major transition (and probably not the final one) in the evolution of evolutionary theory.  Like Gould, I believe most who favour the idea of an "Extended Synthesis" view it as a major step -- but not a giant leap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_______________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scott, E.C. and G.

It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of why piracy works so well for music, and why it is still a &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; smaller problem with TV shows than with songs for a number of reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Most of the content (barring some HBO and Showtime stuff) is free anyway, and cable is incredibly convenient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You don’t download a TV show once and then consume it over and over, like a CD. You have to get a new one every week (or in some cases, every day) and you watch it once and then delete it. The ratio of effort to reward is considerably higher. There are ways to do this reduce the effort a bit (such as RSS downloading) but they still suck because…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Getting the content digitized and put online is a much bigger hassle. With music, you pop a CD in and wait 3 minutes. eDonkey or whatever the kids use these days automatically starts sharing. With TV, you have to buy a tuner for your pc, hook that up to cable, record the program using some software (all of which sucks, and I’ve tried them all) edit out commercials, create a torrent file, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The end result of pirating a video is generally a DivX file. The percentage of the population that knows what to do with one of those, let alone how to get it onto a television, is small and not growing quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who &lt;a href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=639"&gt;downloads TV shows via RSS&lt;/a&gt; (as I do) knows that it’s highly unreliable. In fact, the pain of piracy often drives me to Hulu.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a mistake to assume that Hulu doesn’t want to end up on TVs because they don’t want to be featured in Boxee. Boxee still runs only on computers, and any computer with Boxee can run Hulu. Boxee right now isn’t a better way to get on televisions than the browser.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised to see TVs start shipping with built in Hulu support. Or given that Hulu is part-owned by NBC, a long time partner of Microsoft, it could easily end up on the Xbox 360. The Hulu guys aren’t stupid. They know that their future lies beyond just the PC. And they know that they exist only because of the legal advantage that allows them to be more convenient. They just want to ensure that when they get there, they do so on their terms, not a third party’s as happened to the music industry. They don’t want to escape the same piracy concerns dragging the record labels under just to end up a slaves to Apple, or more likely someone like Boxee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, piracy is a non-factor to Hulu. Consider iTunes, which charges for music and has made inroads against widespread music piracy by offering convenience. The convenience Hulu offers, relative to pirating video, is ten times the amount iTunes does relative to pirating music, and Hulu doesn’t charge a cent. It’s pretty hard to make a case that any of their recent policies are going to change the overall direction online video is moving in.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235260682034"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=3488">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a47060a92a1f253</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Holford believes that meat and dairy foods are ?devoid of essential fats?</title><published>2009-02-21T22:49:33Z</published><updated>2009-02-21T22:49:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/21/holford-believes-that-meat-and-dairy-foods-are-devoid-of-essential-fats/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Oh dear.

(And, you can read the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026"&gt;decisions&lt;/a&gt; yourself &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the last two sentences of the &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/185853/page/1"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; article by Sharon Begley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is bad enough that the vaccine-autism scare has undermined one of the greatest successes of preventive medicine and terrified many new parents. Most tragic of all, it has diverted attention and millions of dollars away from finding the true causes and treatments of a cruel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vaccine-autism scare" is an apt way to describe what increasingly seems like a well-meaning but misdirected panic about vaccines or something in vaccines as somehow being a cause of autism.  Yes, this "scare" has "diverted attention and millions of dollars away" from the real concerns here, but it should be noted that, as important as it is to find out more about "causes and treatments," at the top of everyone's agenda should be the need to provide the best and most appropriate education and services for individuals on the autism spectrum, of all ages. Autism is lifelong and we need to start thinking of it not as a "cruel disease," but as a disability that is most likely genetic, and about how we can change things to best support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact that we've spent so much time and energy and resources on one now-refuted theory of autism: That should really give us reason to panic.&lt;/p&gt;

In the comments, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1076#comment-20508"&gt;Eric wondered&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly curious here: are numbers of applicants for particular jobs a matter of public record (at least, at public institutions)? It would be good to contrast the numbers above with some numbers that show how many folks are actually competing for individual jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.uprm.edu/bischoff/"&gt;Shannon Bischoff&lt;/a&gt;, who contributed the data for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1076"&gt;post #2 in this series&lt;/a&gt;, followed up on this, by writing to twelve departments asking if they would supply their application counts. (Many thanks, Shannon!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon writes, &amp;quot;The departments that responded range from mid-size state universities to large R1  institutions and private universities&amp;quot;. We&amp;#39;re still not sure whether these counts are a matter of public record, so we&amp;#39;re serving up the data without identifying features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Job (identified only by field)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Application count&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;General linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;180&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Phonetics (experimental)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;33&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Syntax (formal)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;47&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Syntax (specific language)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Syntax (specific language)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applied linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Applied linguistics&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these jobs were advertised in the last five years, so they are probably specific data points from &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1082"&gt;post #3 in this series&lt;/a&gt;. The syntax job with just 16 applicants was reported as a special case; the language was very specific and the time from ad to deadline was short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only seven jobs, we don't have enough data for a confident quantitative assessment, but the numbers still help put things in perspective, I think. And they provide a good excuse to repeat  &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1082#comment-20741"&gt;Geoff P's comment&lt;/a&gt;, which (typical of Geoff) is forthright and also heartening if you really listen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make a brief comment about this, addressed to linguistics doctoral students.  I speak as one who simply would not listen when people said "You can never become an academic in linguistics because job vacancies are just too scarce."  For me, the prospect of &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; spending a life in linguistics was unpleasant to think about, so I refused to think about it.  This is the way to think about that enormous blue column over Syntax, the worst piece of data in the bar graph above.  If you think it is saying you can't make it, you are overlooking something important. You are missing a key variable.  What's being left out is &lt;b&gt;just how good you are determined to be&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way to look at that blue spike: The numbers show there are only about 20 job vacancies in syntax for each 100 syntax dissertations.  But that is &lt;b&gt;great&lt;/b&gt; for you!  It means that on average you only have to be better than the next four syntax dissertation-writers who come along, and (assuming broadly merit-based hiring) one of those jobs has your name on it!  You &lt;b&gt;know&lt;/b&gt; that at every conference you've seen papers presented by students who are worse than you aim to be.  You have seen real turkeys mumbling away up there at the mike, presenting analyses that don't fly, or even waddle.  You can damn sure be better than any random four of them.  Can't you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't look at the gross numbers. Look at the field in the competition, and where you think you can place.  You only need to stay out of the bottom 80 percent!  You can do that!  If you work and train harder, you can probably do better than that, and get one of the really good jobs.  It isn't about how many dissertations are being written and accepted; it's about how many dissertations are being written by people who just aren't going to look as good as you are when it comes time for a job talk.  There are lots of them.  All you need to do is think harder than they did, and write better, and give better talks.  And you can do that.  Yes, you can.  Even in syntax (and in the other areas it's easier), you can get a job teaching and researching in an area you find fascinating.  Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

My brain has been terribly "sticky" on a proposal I'm writing for a conference presentation, and tearing my brain away to even read a news story let alone write about it has failed some uncountable number of times.  And not only has my brain been sticky on the topic of the proposal (communication strategies for self-advocates who use uncommon or minority communication methods, e.g. sign language or speech devices) but my brain's been sticky on identity politics and language, and who gets to decide what a person can call themselves, because the proposal requires I use language that not only I find offensive but would anger my immediate community and indeed big chunks of my presentation audience.  So I bite back my feelings and carefully choose words that offend neither the selection committee nor my community, even if that means having to write some terribly awkward phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Language Controversy (i.e. do we say "Disabled person" or "person with a disability") is a really important topic, but also, in my opinion, a disproportionately hot topic that can cause more unproductive contention and flaming than productive discourse.  So while The Language Controversy is an important issue, I've been taking the coward's path for the past few days, "you can't blog about that on change, anything but that, just, just &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;!"  (Figuring someday when there's less polarity in the autism community, when it's "safe," I can pull the topic out, perhaps in retrospect...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have the sticky brain, and unfortunately The Language Controversy is the only thing that is in my head to write about *sigh*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intention of "person first language" (i.e. "person with a disability") may well be a civil rights demand to view a person as a whole person and not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; their disability.  The problem of connecting up everything a person does with their autism and failing to see a whole human being is indeed something that I've written about a lot here, like &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_thin_line_between_desirable_and_dehumanizing"&gt; letting people's talents be their talents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/darwin_einstein_turing_and_posthumous_diagnosis"&gt;not placing undue weight on the role of autism in greatness&lt;/a&gt;.  We are indeed much more than just a bundle of deficits or superpowers as defined by our medical label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But critics of person first language are unconvinced that person first language actually accomplishes that intent.  Indeed some of us consider person first language to be &lt;em&gt;DE&lt;/em&gt;humanizing.  Jim Sinclair wrote a &lt;a href="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/person_first.htm"&gt;seminal essay on the topic&lt;/a&gt;; the essay is from the perspective of the Autistic community, but the sentiment is shared by the Deaf community and many others in the Disability community.  Not only does person first language deny a person the ability to acknowledge the role their sensory/neurological/movement/psychological/etc. differences play in their identity (of equal importance to sex, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, etc.), but it medicalizes the disability.  Part of the today's civil rights movement is working away from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_model_of_disability"&gt;medical models&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability"&gt;social or socio-ecological&lt;/a&gt; models of disability.  Integration and acceptance of disability as part of identity may also be important for psychological well being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which "camp" a person falls into however, the core issue with language is pretty much always cited as RESPECT.  In other words, person first language proponents say separating a person from their disability is more respectful.  Identity first language proponents say acknowledging disability as an aspect of identity is more respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep irony for me is when I ask someone outside of my community to please respect my own preference and I am instead given a lecture about how disrespectful I am being.  To me, what respect actually is about has nothing to do with some global rule that can be dogmatically applied to an entire group of people, but everything to do with listening to and respecting the wishes of a specific individual or a specific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language is fluid and civil rights movements can change.  Respect isn't about dogma, it's about understanding and acknowledging a person or community's perspective.  The hard part (I find as I struggle with it in my proposal) is figuring out how to respect both your own wishes and the wishes of someone with a different perspective.  And knowing when to make that sort of compromise and when to dig in the heels and put up a fight.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235247575335"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8651454273113746315">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4087d93c65167df7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="University" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">"A" for effort</title><published>2009-02-21T19:43:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-21T20:25:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/for-effort.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8651454273113746315/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8651454273113746315" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Anyone involved in teaching has heard the sob story.

So, I am looking for something similar along the "iTunes" line, where one can keep all the PDFs in one place and then create "playlists" with links to the papers.  I think the new &lt;a href="http://www.endnote.com/"&gt;EndNote&lt;/a&gt; may do this.  I am going to try it out.  Does anyone know of any other possibilities for PCs?

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from the reporting that law enforcement is taking this issue seriously.  The &lt;a href="http://sanfrancisco.fbi.gov/pressrel/2009/sf022009.htm"&gt;FBI and seven other law enforcement agencies were involved&lt;/a&gt;, and effort was coordinated through the Joint Terrorism Task Force.  From the press release and reporting, it looks as though agents were following these activists in public places, and filmed them using publicly-available computer terminals.  Even DNA was used to link items in a car used to flee from a harassment incident to the suspects arrested.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI's press release alleges the following harassment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; On Sunday, October 21, 2007 a group of approximately twenty people, including Mr. Buddenberg, Mr. Pope, and Ms. Stumpo, demonstrated outside a University of California Berkeley professor's personal residence in El Cerrito, California. The group, some wearing bandanas to hide their faces, trespassed on his front yard, chanted slogans, and accused him of being a murderer because of his use of animals in research. The professor told police he was afraid, and felt harassed and intimidated by the extremists.

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, January 27, 2008, a group of approximately eleven individuals, including Mr. Buddenberg, Mr. Pope, Ms. Stumpo, and Ms. Khajavi, demonstrated outside the private residences of several University of California Berkeley researchers over the course of the day. At each residence, extremists dressed generally in all black clothing and wearing bandanas to hide their faces marched, chanted, and chalked defamatory comments on the public sidewalks in front of the residences. One of the researchers informed authorities he had been previously harassed and the incident had caused him to fear for his health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2008, five to six individuals including Mr. Pope, Ms. Stumpo, and Ms. Khajavi, attempted to forcibly enter the private home of a University of California researcher in Santa Cruz. When her husband opened the door, a struggle ensued and he was hit by an object. As the individuals fled, one yelled, "We're gonna get you." The professor and her husband both told the FBI they were terrified by the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 29, 2008, a stack of flyers titled &amp;quot;Murderers and torturers alive &amp;amp; well in Santa Cruz July 2008 edition&amp;quot; was found at the Café Pergolesi in Santa Cruz. The fliers listed the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of several University of California researchers and stated &amp;quot;animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse.&amp;quot; The investigation connected Mr. Buddenberg, Mr. Pope, and Ms. Stumpo to the production and distribution of the fliers. Distribution of the fliers preceded two firebomb attacks outside researchers&amp;#39; Santa Cruz homes, both of which are still under investigation by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm willing to bet that local and federal police have people in every one of the area animal rights groups, in light of this pattern of harassment.  This effort is likely to deflate this type of criminal behavior, because violations of the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act can result in up to 5 years in prison.  Whether guilty or innocent, a federal investigation and prosecution will turn one's life upside down.  And if guilty, the government will be seeking maximum prison stays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/4_arrested_in_animal_researche.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/0QDa5k9v2Ek" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235238773606"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1163">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f629b5c0c0592fa7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the media"/><title type="html">Set your recorders now!</title><published>2009-02-21T17:19:11Z</published><updated>2009-02-21T17:19:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1163" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/thelinguists-posterimage.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/thelinguists-posterimage-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="thelinguists-posterimage" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; As Scott Simon &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100874724"&gt;reminds us&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Weekend Edition Saturday&lt;/i&gt; this morning, &lt;a href="http://www.thelinguists.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Linguists&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will premiere on PBS stations across the nation this Thursday. (Check and double-check your local listings for the exact time (or even the day) of the premiere, which may vary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to finally seeing the film. I'm also looking forward to &lt;a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/dharris2/"&gt;David Harrison&lt;/a&gt;'s upcoming visit to my corner of Language Log Plaza on April 23 and 24. If you find yourself in the San Diego area around that time, &lt;a href="http://ling.ucsd.edu/events/thelinguists/"&gt;come on by&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to add that I was a bit disappointed with Scott Simon's &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100874724"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with David Harrison and Greg Anderson this morning. After a fairly good introduction and a good first couple of questions (asking what first brought David and Greg together, and what happens when a language dies), Scott decides to lighten things up a bit and chuckles to himself as he says: &amp;quot;May I ask, each of you in turn: what&amp;#39;s the strangest language you think you&amp;#39;ve ever heard?&amp;quot; Greg (rather wisely) prompts David to go first, and David avoids immediately taking the bait by saying, &amp;quot;Well, they&amp;#39;re all strange from a certain point of view, and English is strange, but…&amp;quot; — at which point Scott interjects: &amp;quot;English can be &lt;i&gt;particularly&lt;/i&gt; strange." (David: "It can be, indeed.") Things devolve into a discussion of "strange language sounds", the idea that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilabial_fricative"&gt;some technical linguistics terms&lt;/a&gt; sound obscene, and so on — it gets serious and picks up again towards the end, but Scott can&amp;#39;t resist closing with more chuckles and another reference to the language &lt;a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=biy"&gt;Birhor&lt;/a&gt; (sounds like "beer whore").

We are asked, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.dailygrail.com/poll/best-afterlife-evidence"&gt;The best evidence for an afterlife is from…&lt;/a&gt;", and the answer so far is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediums

Near-death experiences
26% (147 votes)&lt;br&gt;
Reincarnation memories
15% (86 votes)&lt;br&gt;

There is no evidence
27% (156 votes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get the popularity of the NDE &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot;. I had a friend once who told me that he had the most awesome experience on &amp;#39;shrooms — he&amp;#39;d melted into a purple puddle that soaked into the earth, and he had spiritual sex with tree roots. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that didn&amp;#39;t actually happen, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t use it to argue that human beings were capable of phase changes into a fluid state or that intimate congress with plants was fun and rewarding, but people use the same logic all the time in arguing that while they were in a brain-damaged state, befuddled by anoxia, their perception of the hallucinatory state afterwards is evidence that there is a heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what "crisis apparitions" are. I don't care to know either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard of EVPs — they&amp;#39;re all the rage right now thanks to all those horrible &amp;#39;ghosthunter&amp;#39; shows on TV. Leave a tape recorder running in an empty room, then play it back with lots of amplification of the background hiss and crackle of noise. If you are gullible and really want to believe, you will hear random splutters that you can imagine are sort of voices. And the really cool thing is that if you tell someone that this scrap of noise says something like, &amp;quot;Paul is dead&amp;quot;, then &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; pattern-forming circuits in their brain will impose your interpretation on the noise for you, and they'll hear the same thing! Very convincing, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I voted for no evidence. If you vote otherwise, maybe you can come back here and explain your evidence to us.

&lt;p&gt;Then we walked over to &lt;a href="http://www.oldtownbar.com/" title=""&gt;Old Town Bar&lt;/a&gt;, where we soon were joined by my Scibling &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/" title=""&gt;Jake Young&lt;/a&gt;, my old friend from SciFoo and the 1st Science Blogging Conference &lt;a href="http://elementlist.com/" title=""&gt;Jacqueline Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/arvindsays" title=""&gt;Twitter buddy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://arvindsays.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Arvind Baddepudi&lt;/a&gt;, and the Overlords of the new Nature Network &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/nyc/blog" title=""&gt;NYC Hub&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/U7754A00D/profile" title=""&gt;Barry Hudson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/caryn/profile" title=""&gt;Caryn Shechtman&lt;/a&gt; and her boyfriend Nikola Trbovic with whom I could converse in Serbian language:&lt;/p&gt;

My only nit to pick is that the puppet flirts a little too close to conflating the thimerosal scare with the MMR scare. There never was any thimerosal in the MMR vaccine. But that's just a nit, and as a blogger it's my job to pick it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, though, the puppet Stephen Colbert's description of Jenny McCarthy reminds me of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php"&gt;her son's doctor&lt;/a&gt;, if you know what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now sure, she's not the kind of expert who relies on facts and figures....She knows what she feels is true. She's that kind of expert."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that about sums it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/andrew_wakefield_scuzz-wo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/UsRQqnnTM-w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235227586123"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7377751645232602748">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c9e07ec6b3933c5b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">My Interview on CFI&amp;#39;s Point of Inquiry Program</title><published>2010-01-21T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-01-21T12:44:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/niUZ0s2Sh8Q/my-interview-on-cfis-point-of-inquiry.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/7377751645232602748/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=7377751645232602748" title="5 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-interview-on-cfis-point-of-inquiry.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/john_w._loftus_-_why_i_became_an_atheist/"&gt;Enjoy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

The segment is called &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100867217"&gt;Doubting Darwin: Debate Over The Mind’s Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, and features interviews with me and Dr. Egnor. The interviews were recorded separately - it was not a discussion or debate. Of course we are each very familiar with the other’s arguments, and readers of this blog will recognize most of the points made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segment was well produced and fair (at least from my perspective, I can’t speak for Dr. Egnor) - they used my points in context, chose reasonably representative segments, and did not sandbag me with counterpoints I was not aware of. (These are all risks when being interviewed, especially by lower quality outlets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was one point that Dr. Egnor made toward the end that was not adequately addressed. He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The person was able to have mental processes during a time when they were in cardiac arrest, in cardiac standstill, and sometimes even absent EEG waves. So I think there is very real scientific evidence that the mind in some circumstances can exist without a functioning brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that he never tried to make this claim in our blog debate (if he did I missed it). And of course, this claim is utterly false, and Dr. Egnor cannot produce any reference to support it - something which he essentially admits by referring to this evidence in the interview as “anecdotal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The segment producer added that neuroscientists claim there is still some brain activity during cardiac arrest, even if the EEG signals are hard to detect. This is true, but is only one of the two reasons why Egnor’s claim is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, like Deepak Chopra, have tried to use near-death experiences as support for a mind separate from brain. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=381"&gt;I have written about his before&lt;/a&gt; as well. There are two reasons why NDEs are not evidence for a mind separate from brain. The first is that there is no reason to conclude that all brain activity stops during cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR provides enough blood flow to the brain to keep it alive - that’s its primary function. This is enough to allow for some activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that EEGs are not routinely performed during CPR. It would not be feasible to place EEG electrodes on the scalp during CPR. Therefore we only see the EEG during CPR when the EEG was already in place. I am personally aware of only one case in which this occurred - the patient’s heart stopped while being EEG monitored (and it was not detected for some time, so there was no CPR). Brain waves rapidly decrease but do not instantly disappear when the heart stops. They maintain a low level of function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are &lt;a href="http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/anesb/abstract.00000524-200406000-00015.htm;jsessionid=JfxVPwQnDs8B1WjgJ7pQY9SJynfMc93py6P1QZsps2gcwLdmTTDn!1910807570!181195628!8091!-1"&gt;reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of using bispectral index (a form of EEG that is used to monitor level of consciousness during anesthesia) to monitor the response of brain function to CPR. Effective CPR was able to maintain brain activity as measured by bispectral index - therefore the evidence suggests that CPR is capable of maintaining measurable brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, if someone survives CPR and later recovers consciousness then it could not have proceeded for very long -  30-60 minutes at most. During this time brain activity will not have completely vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the first premise of Dr. Egnor’s anecdotal claim is not true - that there is demonstrably no brain activity during mental activity. The second premise is also not true - that the memories later reported of a near-death experience occurred during CPR, or during the time of minimal brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone has a sufficiently prolonged CPR that their brain activity is diminished, then it also must be true that their brain will take time to recover - hours to days. It is not like in the movies where someone comes back from cardiac arrest, their eyes flutter open and they are completely conscious. Rather, CPR survivors will slowly regain brain function and will be delirious for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time of delirium they are forming confused memories, and have very poor time sense. It is simply not possible from any documented case to time any memory later reported by a CPR survivor to the time of their CPR - the time when their brain activity was most decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Dr. Egnor’s two necessary premises for his point - that there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; brain activity, and there is mental activity &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; this time - have not been established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if this were true then Dr. Egnor would win our little debate. If there were reliable scientific evidence that the mind can exist without the brain, then the mind must be something other than just brain. But Dr. Egnor cannot make this case - if he could, he would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, he tried to slip in “anecdotal” claims during a radio interview that would not allow for a thorough exploration of his claims - claims already demolished by me and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Dr. Egnor, either provide references adequate to establish your premises or admit that there is no evidence for mind separate from brain.&lt;/p&gt;

You know how the announcers have to just keep talking all the time to try to fill the time interestingly enough in between repeating the phone number to call – I’m impressed that they stay as coherent as they do. Anyway, the other announcer, a regular classical music host, had just said something interesting about some composer, and K*** replied, “I didn’t know that, and certainly wouldn’t of have without listening to WFCR.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Barbara Partee</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235216445853"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=1170">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e5a3a1ebe2548523</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="Fair trading"/><category term="HR bollocks"/><category term="Human resources"/><category term="Leicester university"/><category term="SCENAR"/><category term="Universities"/><category term="Wellbeing"/><category term="acupuncture"/><category term="advertisements"/><category term="antiscience"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><category term="HR"/><category term="vice-chancellors"/><title type="html">Wellbeing at Leicester gets honest (eventually)</title><published>2009-02-21T11:35:07Z</published><updated>2009-02-21T11:35:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1170" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.dcscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is almost six months now since I posted &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=258"&gt;Quackery creeps into good universities too -but through Human Resources&lt;/a&gt;.  One  example given there was the University of Leicester. This is an excellent  university.  It does first class research and it was the &lt;em&gt;alma mater&lt;/em&gt; of  the incomparable &lt;a title="BBC biography" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/david_attenborough.shtml"&gt;David  Attenborough&lt;/a&gt; who has done more than anyone to show us the true beauty and wonder of the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, their well-meaning occupational  health department had a section about “complementary therapies” that  contained a lot of statements that were demonstrably untrue. They even recommended the utterly outrageous SCENAR device. So I pointed this out to them, and  I had a quick and sympathetic response from their HR director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three months later, &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=258#follow"&gt;nothing  had changed&lt;/a&gt;. Every now and then, I’d send a polite reminder, but it seemed  the occupational health staff were very wedded to their quackery.   The  last reminder went on 6th February, but this time I copied it to Leicester’s vice-chancellor.  This time it worked. There is still a link to Complementary Therapies on the &lt;a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/staffwellbeing/"&gt;Wellbeing  site&lt;/a&gt;, but if you click on it, &lt;a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/staffwellbeing/complementary_therapy.html"&gt;this is what you see&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="95%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Complementary therapies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some employees may have an interest in complementary therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, Indian head massage, Reiki, sports &amp;amp; remedial massage, reflexology and hypnotherapy.  If you have an interest in any of these, Staff Counselling can happily provide details of practitioners in the local area.  Some of these practitioners offer discounts from their normal rates for University of Leicester staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the University of Leicester cannot vouch for, or recommend any of these therapies to staff as being effective.  We would urge members of staff who believe that such therapies might be effective to contact their GP prior to undertaking any of them.  Further, the University of Leicester shall not be liable for any damage of any kind arising out of or related to the services of any complementary therapists or treatments listed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like further information, please contact Chris Wilson at: staffcounsel&amp;amp;welfare@le.ac.uk or telephone 1702.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not bad. Pity it doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;complementary&lt;/em&gt; though.   Euphemisms aren’t really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact I have a bit of a problem with “wellbeing” too.  It is a harmless word that has been highjacked so that its use now makes one think of mud baths provided by expensive hotels for their rich and gullible customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leicester’s  HR director wrote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately an instruction I had given previously had not been fully complied with.  I spoke to the manager of the Staff Counselling team on Friday and gave clear instructions as to the content of this site.  I had been assured that the offending information had been removed, but found that it had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now checked the site for myself and can say, with confidence, that all claims for the efficacy of complimentary [sic] therapies have been removed including SCENAR.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarity between quack treatments and religion is intriguing.  It seems that the devotion of the occupational health people to their baloney was so great that they wouldn’t take it down even when told to do so.  The more irrational the belief, the greater the fervour with which it is defended,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the lesson from this minor saga?  It seems that most VCs and many HR people are too sensible to believe in alternative baloney, but that they are a bit too ready to tolerate it, perhaps on grounds  of political correctness.  Tolerance is a virtue, but lies about health are not in the least virtuous. If you point out that people are saying things for which there isn’t the slightest evidence, they will often respond.  Just be prepared to send a few reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also be useful to point out that some of the claims made are &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=790"&gt;almost  certainly illegal&lt;/a&gt;.  Even people who care little about evidence of efficacy are impressed by the idea that they might be prosecuted by Trading  Standards officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who needs mystical medicine when you have real wonders like these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further entangling of education and the law and I don't mean &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt;: In Carmel, Indiana, the February &lt;a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20090219/LOCAL0101/902200330"&gt;Carmel Star&lt;/a&gt; reports that a then-14-year-old student on the spectrum was tased twice by an officer inside the school. On March 11 of last year, the student was late for school and was told he would receive detention at the end of the day. He became frustrated and "'acted out.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During this outburst he is saying outrageous things," said the Bells' attorney, Ronald Frazier, noting that the boy threatened to call members of his gang to retaliate against the teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They know there is no gang there," Frazier said. "They know he has no way of acting on what he is saying. They are taking these idle threats and calling police."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bells contend the school district failed to follow the guidelines they had set up to deal with the boy's outbursts -- techniques the family says would have given the boy a chance to cool off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When a child like (the Bells' son) starts to have emotional problems, the (individual procedure) is supposed to be followed," Frazier said. "It has specific steps that are to be taken in order to keep the child from melting totally down."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, school officials dialed 911.&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An officer came to the school and, when he was not able to "control the 5-foot, 90-pound boy," the officer drew his Taser and shocked the boy two times. The boy was unconscious and taken to a local hospital, before being released to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow it seems that the school should have had another way to deal with the student getting upset than...........calling 911?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do I start.....oh yeah, looks like YOUR site "James" takes donations. Trying to make money off of bullying people and their beliefs? I guess so. Well, anyhow, the way you seemed to "cut and paste" certain excerpts from their site to read the way YOU want it to sound is so "media like"...good job, heh. Here is a great idea...IF YOU DON'T LIKE or BELIEVE IN WHAT SOMEONE HAS ON THE INTERNET, THEN DON'T READ IT! Or, if you just happen to read it and don't like it.....SHUT UP!

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minot Representative Kari Conrad says under the bill’s terms, it would be murder to deliberately destroy a fertilized egg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minot Representative Dan Ruby sponsored the bill. He says it’s an attempt to define when life begins. He says that’s necessary to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court Roe versus Wade decision that made abortion legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder Mr. Ruby thinks&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk6t_tdOkwo"&gt; the punishment for murdering an egg should be&lt;/a&gt;. Should we throw egg murderers in jail for life, execute them, or just tell them they’re bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if the mother drinks a sip of wine, is that child abuse? I don’t think North Dakota has thought this thing through.&lt;/p&gt;

I know what you’re thinking. There is no Freedom of Choice Act. But you see, that’s the brilliance of it. Anybody can protest a bill that actually exists. But it takes a keen mind to launch a major campaign against a non-existant bill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A national postcard campaign is flooding the White House and congressional offices with messages opposing FOCA, and Catholic bishops have made defeating the abortion rights legislation a top priority. In the most recent effort to stop the bill, Cardinal Justin Rigali of Philadelphia sent a letter to every member of Congress imploring them to “please oppose FOCA.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one hitch. Congress isn’t about to pass the Freedom of Choice Act — because no such bill has been introduced in the current Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when the United States is gripped by economic uncertainty and faces serious challenges in hot spots around the globe, some American Catholics are finding it both curious and troubling that &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1859856,00.html"&gt;their church&lt;/a&gt; has launched a major campaign against a piece of legislation that doesn’t exist and wouldn’t have much chance of becoming law even if it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with a chain email of unknown origin. Overly paranoid Catholics spread word throughout their ranks. You know how these things go. One person tells their friends, who tell their friends, who tell their friends, and so on, and so on, ad infinatum. That email said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) is set to be signed if Congress passes it on January 21-22 of 2009. The FOCA is the next sick chapter in the book of abortion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was an army of Catholics mobilizing a giant campaign like what happened with Prop. 8 (though not that similar since Prop. 8, you know, was actually real).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of all this activity, the fact that there was no Freedom of Choice Act before the 111th Congress went largely unnoticed and unmentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in true religious fashion, nobody questioned anything. I almost think it was a shame that the email didn’t say the bill would pass on April 1st. That would have been possibly the greatest April Fools surprise EVER!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report was based on a study of confessions carried out by Fr Roberto Busa, a 95-year-old Jesuit scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously anyone whose 95 years old has all the answers, right? If you look like Yoda, you must know what you’re talking about so far be it for anybody who actually understands a little bit about human psychology to question his authority on these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pope’s personal theologian backed up the report in the Vatican newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa! Now we’re talking. Well if Joey Ratz’s personal theologian agrees with him, that’s it. Case closed. Between the 2 of them, they have all the knowledge in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it incredibly frustrating that millions of people actually care about what Beavis and Butthead over here think of human behavior. Idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

A wide array of evidence from pseudogenes, endogenous retroviruses, and functional genes generally corroborates the picture of common descent that began to be worked out in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries mainly from comparative anatomy when even the existence of genes was unknown..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we know that out near the twigs, trees inferred from individual genes and species trees are not identical, and Thomas Mailund, a researcher at the &lt;a href="http://www.birc.au.dk/" rel="external "&gt;Bioinformatics Research Center&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, has &lt;a href="http://www.mailund.dk/index.php/2009/02/12/on-gene-trees-and-species-trees/" rel="external "&gt;an excellent post&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between gene trees and species trees with some great illustrations.

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to check the updates to ERV&amp;#39;s posts above — I called it perfectly. In the case of Luskin, even more perfectly than perfect.

went on a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/06/field_trip_to_the_creation_mus.php" rel="external "&gt;field trip to the Creationist Museum&lt;/a&gt; a couple of summers ago.  (See &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/05/the_creation_museum.php" rel="external "&gt;here for a comprehensive links list&lt;/a&gt; to critiques of the museum.)  In addition to offers of books, DVDs and 10% off specials on stuff like “Ancient Civilizations &amp;amp; the Bible - Full Family Curriculum Pack,” I get a weekly dose of creationist apologetics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read those apologetics missives, one message is loud and clear.  The core of AIG’s message is that one must choose one’s presuppositions and thereafter interpret the evidence in the light of those presuppositions.  The creationist museum makes that very clear.  An early display has two paleontologists digging in what looks like a sand pit, with one of them, the kindly-looking creationist, explaining that he and his evolutionist friend (who looks vaguely Asian and never speaks) use the same evidence, but that they interpret it from different starting points, Biblical creationism and “man’s reason.”  Hence each interprets the evidence to support his presuppositions; the evidence is not a tool for testing presuppositions and assumptions, it is interpreted through their lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia Purdom, creationist geneticist in the employ of Answers in Genesis, is also very clear about it.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2008/05/15/answers-in-genesis-wall/" rel="external "&gt;She says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a friendly “debate” with a gentleman afterwards concerning the merits of presuppositionalism vs. evidentialism. This person believed there was “neutral ground” where evolutionists and creationists can debate the evidence and that the evidentialist approach was better to use with non-Christians. I tried to help him see that neutral ground does not exist because both sides have presuppositions–creationists start with the authority of the Word of God and evolutionists start with the authority of human reasoning. If we as creationists agree to “leave the Bible out of it,” then we are starting with the same presuppositions as the evolutionists and will not be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Creation Research has the same approach.  &lt;a href="http://dododreams.blogspot.com/2008/01/emptying-cat-bags.html" rel="external "&gt;John Pieret pointed to Henry Morris, III&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of ICR these days, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are forensically interpreting the data based on our presupposition. The evolutionists do the same thing. They have a presupposition that there is no supernatural intervention of any kind. We have a presupposition that there is supernatural intervention in the past, not in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You reckon Henry watches CSI:Creationism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the presupposition of the U.S. justice system is (purportedly) that one is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  But if we adopt the AIG/ICR philosophical/apologetic position regarding presuppositions, no amount of evidence that seems to support guilt can alter the presumption of innocence.  Hence if I’m ever charged with a crime, I want AIG creationists on the jury: I’m guaranteed an acquittal, because, you see, evidence doesn’t count in evaluating presuppositions!  And doing CSI becomes infinitely easier: Decide who’s guilty beforehand and simply interpret the evidence appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

But this one story has been in my alerts for like four months, several times a week, and at this point I've seen it so many times that despite it not being of significant interest to me, I feel compelled to comment on it--&lt;a href="http://www.saukvalley.com/articles/2009/02/17/features/lifestyles/doc499af43a41312823476822.txt"&gt;New video helps autistic children read emotions&lt;/a&gt; (in some format or other, on various news sources all over, over and over, and they say &lt;em&gt;I'm&lt;/em&gt; repetitive, sheesh!).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I've seen the two-liner on this article, I've had the thought strike me (well, following the thought, "why am I still getting alerts for this story?"): Did the creators of the video take into account possible sensory issues with "reading emotions" from non-verbal communication?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I finally caved and went over to &lt;a href="http://www.thetransporters.com"&gt;the video's web site&lt;/a&gt; to see what it is really about.  Even though I had read about "faces of human actors superimposed on digitally animated vehicles," I was ill prepared for how deeply creepy these things are.  Definitely an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"&gt;uncanny valley&lt;/a&gt; issue for me.  That aside though, and ignoring a deep critique of certain theories about autism, the web site gave me no indication that sensory issues had been considered in the "reading of emotions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, a fair number people on the spectrum report a lot of difficulty making sense of visual stimuli for various reasons.  At a keynote of hers I attended, &lt;a href="http://donnawilliams.net"&gt;Donna Williams&lt;/a&gt; talked about visual sorts of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia"&gt;aphasia&lt;/a&gt;, and difficulty recognizing what all the parts of a face even are let alone how they function together.  She describes this also from personal experience in her books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Blackman in her book &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vFtwGgAACAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Lucy%27s+Story&amp;amp;ei=4uScSaCLI6OSkATosLjmCQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy's Story: Autism and Other Adventures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describes figure/ground confusions and visual distortions, for example, "My eyes picked up different signals from the light, shade, color, and movement that passed into the retina and thence to my brain.  I basically emphasized folds and depths.  The other children seem to have discarded these in their visual sorting, because these shadows are only background in the world view of most human beings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked a little about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/mono-sensing_and_understanding_speech"&gt;mono-sensing and understanding speech&lt;/a&gt; last week--if I have my vision "turned off" in order to actually make sense of a person's words, how am I supposed to simultaneously be processing the visual stimuli of their facial expressions?  I may know full well what a smile looks like, but it does me little good if I'm blinded by attending to hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people on the spectrum have non-verbal learning disabilities that make it difficult for them to process visual information much at all.  Darius in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ujVVnPN5fe8C&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Aquamarine+Blue+5&amp;amp;ei=s-acSZ_TKobgkATP0NTlCQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aquamarine Blue 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says, "I often seemed to process only the most basic visual information.  I don't know how many times I poured tea into the jar of marmalade for instance, instead of into my mug.  Apparently I was capable of processing the visual-spatial idea of open versus shut, but not much more." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autistic kids who don't have these sorts of sensory differences may learn from a video like "The Transporters."  But I remain unconvinced that such a tool is helpful to those of us who struggle with with visual processing.  More importantly, I would like to know why sensory differences, which are so widely reported, are often left out of tools for social and language learning.  Is there sufficient engagement by the people who develop these tools with autistic individuals who are able to articulate their experiences?

Skinner's behaviorism. So it's a bit ironic to read that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090217141544.htm"&gt;robots are being developed&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at &lt;a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the "emotional state" of children on the spectrum and even, potentially, to teaching social skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot's ability to provide consistent and predictable responses should be particularly useful for treating ASD. Each child has individual triggers. For example, one child may not like direct eye contact. Another might be upset by loud voices and sounds. Yet another may react when people get too close. Once a particular trigger is identified, a robot could be programmed to increase the stimulus at such a gradual rate that the child doesn't notice it. The robot could also be programmed to back off when it senses that its responses are beginning to bother the child. In this fashion, it could build up the child's tolerance to the problem stimulus. "Robots can be programmed to respond with a consistency that is difficult for humans to achieve," [Nilanjan Sarkar, associate professor of mechanical engineering] points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such robot-instructors, it's suggested, could be used to help defray the "costs" of teaching children and, for the above reasons, provide a more consistent learning environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all makes sense to me but the machines-for-teachers idea troubles me. ABA teaching has been very beneficial to my son's learning, but often precisely because of the "human element"---because of the people who are teaching him, and who don't always say the same phrase exactly the same way, and sometimes respond one way and sometimes don't. From these interactions, Charlie's developed real relationships with therapists and teachers. A huge part of teaching effectively involves, I think, being able to make the most of the unexpected and the "teachable moment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure that can be programmed in.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope you all had weeks that were significantly less shitty than mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the Comment o’ the Week, I wanted to briefly mention an issue that cropped up yesterday here on the blog. Stacey had posted something about &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4684238/Sarah-Palins-daughter-Bristol-against-teen-pregnancy.html&amp;amp;ei=3R2fSdjDBNKgtwfkofyCDQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=news_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHFUfwCGg9R2erl0LHoG0zD8Xeq8w"&gt;Bristol Palin’s recent interview&lt;/a&gt; in which she stated the obvious: that abstinence-only education doesn’t frigging work. The post was on-topic because of the simple fact that abstinence-only education is completely illogical and yet continually pushed by people (often Christian fundamentalists), to the detriment of our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the post sparked some controversy, and due to worries that it was too politically biased and offensive to some readers, Stacey deleted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time something like that has happened, so among the Skepchicks we never discussed what someone should do with a post she no longer felt should be public. The deletion of this article sparked that conversation, and we agreed that this isn’t something that should happen again in the future. We’ve also gone over alternatives to deletion, such as locking thread comments and editing posts to include flagged updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry for those of you who were participating in the thread and were left wondering where it went. Stacey offered to restore the post but unfortunately, once a post is deleted in that way, it’s gone for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, you have my assurance that this won’t happen again, and I’m sure that we’ll have plenty more politically-charged posts in the future for your bickering pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to Comment! O! The! Week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in a remarkably cruddy mood, so while sorting through the nominations for COTW, I decided to just go with the first one that made me laugh out loud, and I mean that in the purest sense: the very first comment I read that caused me to involuntarily emit a sound of joy.&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6079&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-52276"&gt; Here it is&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that “Eternal Reefs” is a little obscure for the name of a company that turns cremated remains into fish habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have gone with “Ashes to Splashes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, Durnett, you slay me. Congratulations, you win an eternal resting place in a watery grave . . . IN THE LOST CITY OF ATLANTIS. You think I’m joking? &lt;a href="http://www.thisiswhyyourestupid.com/post/79977942/plato-wrote-an-article-about-it-and-theres-a"&gt;Well I’m not&lt;/a&gt;.

I've always been interested in the reputations of institutions, especially universities, and the degree to which relatively small events loom very large in long-term reputation.

&lt;p&gt;It's reassuring to me to see that people are catching on.  When we hear pseudoscience drivel, it's never unique.  It always follows a specific method - the pseudoscientific method.

Here's a taste:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What on earth were you thinking when you produced a garish cover proclaiming that "Darwin was wrong" (24 January)?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
First, it's false, and second, it's inflammatory. And, as you surely know, many readers will interpret the cover not as being about Darwin, the historical figure, but about evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nothing in the article showed that the concept of the tree of life is unsound; only that it is more complicated than was realised before the advent of molecular genetics. It is still true that all of life arose from "a few forms or... one", as Darwin concluded in The Origin of Species. It is still true that it diversified by descent with modification via natural selection and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, despite his claim that "after this I'm going to have to stop posting for a while", he's sent another essay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Here is an interim post clearing up some   outstanding questions; the last part turned into an in-depth discussion   of the "thorn cluster" problem that will probably be published somewhere   eventually.  I do mean to get back to the "IE homeland" problem, but   that won't be possible till the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping that he gets drawn back in again earlier than that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don is a user of the &lt;a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pinax/greekkeys/Atheniandownload.html"&gt;Athenian font&lt;/a&gt;, a polytonic Greek font produced by the American Philological Association. Now that the problems with Unicocode representations of polytonic Greek have been fixed, more or less, this font is deprecated; and for good reason, because setting up browser preferences, font installation, etc., so that you could see it correctly on a web page is difficult. In Don's earlier guest posts, I've gone through them and (along with re-doing the MS Word formatting) substituted Unicode characters for the Athenian code points. This time, I've decided to put a .pdf up on the web and link to it. So click &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DonRinge022009.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to read it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And Don has decided to switch to Unicode Greek in the future, though he echoes Rolf Noyer in complaining that "it clearly wasn't   put together by a classicist".)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235160176224"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6133">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45ec9c044624d098</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition, 2.20</title><published>2009-02-20T20:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T20:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6133" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1beafebbab2576c2ae4319408c7858f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Newdow, who you may remember from the lawsuit he filed to remove “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance, is continuing his efforts to keep church and state separate. Newdow recently filed a lawsuit to exclude the religious elements of Obama’s inauguration and although the preliminary injunction was denied, Newdow is now &lt;a href="http://atheistnexus.org/forum/topics/mike-newdow-invites-atheist"&gt;looking for 1,000 for individuals to join him&lt;/a&gt; as plaintiffs in his suit.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think Newdow’s suit is ‘worth it’?  Are there other areas of the law that the secular movement’s time is better spent (such as combatting &lt;a href="http://secular.org/news/Obama_faith_based090205.html"&gt;faith-based initiatives&lt;/a&gt; or keeping &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29257326/"&gt;anti-abortion&lt;/a&gt; laws off the books)?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mariancall.com"&gt;Marian&lt;/a&gt; is some kinda gal, and her voice is simply astonishing. She’s a Browncoat, in case you didn’t know, so the song’s relation to Mal’s ship — and his predicaments — is no coincidence. Also, I love the double meanings in many of her songs; &amp;quot;in the black&amp;quot; means to be out of debt, but in Firefly it means being deep in space. Many times, that’s where safety lies. But that’s not what &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; was built for.&lt;/p&gt;

See what you think:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;czechaitian, said...I see Jesus as my center, empirically speaking, because it works for me-- makes sense of my experience, focuses my decision making, teaches me foundation and relationship and commitment, opens practical life opportunities. Why would anyone put something/someone at the center of their lives or mature toward something if that "something" is not producing measurable results?&lt;/blockquote&gt;My response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For you Christianity is your social life. That's all it is. That's all it ever is. It does not require you to explain how God can think (since thinking demand weighing temporal alternatives); it doesn't require you to explain how three persons of the trinity just happened to be united who have always existed as a single Godhead; it doesn't ask you to explain why God created something in the first place given the amount of horrible suffering in the world and the fact that he was supposedly perfect in love neither needing nor wanting anything; it doesn't ask you to explain the criteria for the human DNA chosen that made up Jesus's body (since Joseph was not supplying any); it doesn't ask you to explain how Jesus is 100% man and 100% God with nothing left over; it doesn't require you to explain where the human resurrected body of Jesus will spend eternity (can it simply be discarded since this Jesus was sinless, or does a trinue God now have a member who is embodied forever); it doesn't ask you to explain how a cannabalized body can be resurrected; it doesn't ask you to explain why a supposedly timeless God now chooses to live forever in time subsequent to creation lest all of the results of human history disappear; it doesn't ask you to explain much of anything crucial to what you believe, and I could go on and on and on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You believe because you worship in a community of other believers who give meaning to your life. Take you out of that community for a few months or more, read some books, and your faith could suffer and even die. A faith like yours should be sustainable apart from the Christian community of believers but you'll never attempt this, will you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

He's saying, you're screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, taxpaying citizens, you can rejoice, because tax cheats across the country are having panic attacks.  They're thinking about refiling their tax returns, or going to the IRS to beg forgiveness with a check to cover past taxes and potential fines.  Some are evening thinking about sailing away from this great country.  Good riddance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a 9/11 trend that requires banks to collect more information about their clients, and the fact that our government needs money, bank secrecy is on life support.  Governments are willing to share information nowadays, and as the Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/business/worldbusiness/20ubs.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, the US government is going after 52,000 customers of UBS bank.  (If you're a customer, call your lawyer, today.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When rich and powerful people have their privacy invaded, it oftentimes results in new privacy laws.  Maybe the long-term result of this will be less privacy for the ultra tax cheating rich, and more for us.

Unfortunately, his account of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_comma"&gt;Pythagorean comma&lt;/a&gt; is psychoacoustically, historically and mathematically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gets off to a good start by introducing the Circle of Fifths, showing that 12 fifths bring you back to the name nominal pitch class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Tune a starting note, say middle C (or if you’re tuning a piano, A-440). The human ear can hear, and tune, a perfect fifth, so we would next tune G, because G is a fifth above C. We would then tune a fifth up from G (D), then a fifth above D (A), and so forth, until it led us finally back to our starting note, C (and that brings us back to do!) It looks like this (the acoustic space between each adjacent pair of tones is a fifth):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-F-C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he goes off the rails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Acoustically, what the human ear hears as a perfect fifth is just slightly more than a fifth (about 2 cents, and there are 100 cents in a semi-tone). But as we tune from fifth to fifth, that tiny difference adds up, one after another, so when we get back to C, it is WAY out of tune with our starting C.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, no.  The problem is that a perfect fifth is a ratio of 3/2, while an octave is a ratio of 2/1; and (3/2)&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; — the result of 12 successive intervals of a fifth–  is not the same as 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; — the result of 7 successive intervals of an octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are close — 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; is 128, while (3/2)&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; is around 129.7463. Another way to see the relationship is to note that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3/2)&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = 3&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; = 531441/524288&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they're not the same, and the difference is what is known as the "Pythagorean Comma". This is just mathematics, and has nothing to do with the properties of the human auditory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed here a couple of years ago ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004894.html"&gt;Pavarotti and the crack to chaos&lt;/a&gt;", 9/9/2007), the Pythagoreans saw this difference as one of three crucial flaws in the fundamental mathematical fabric of reality that challenged their belief in its coherence.  So when the G.O.C. writes that "the ear is imperfect, so we have the Pythagorean Comma, a serious problem identified by Pythagoras that was not solved until the 18th Century", he's wrong.  And it's historically as well as physically and mathematically important that this issue is not merely a matter of some imperfection in the human sensory apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn't be writing this, I should be working on the announcements for the new journal that I'm helping to start,  or one of the papers that I owe, or the problem set that I need to create.   But as Randall Munroe (or his cartoon character, anyhow) &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005424.html"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;, "What do you want me to do?  LEAVE?  Then they'll keep being wrong!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know that the G.O.C. appreciates mathematical rigor and historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235151799729"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/female_troubles">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f81184ecf400c6bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Female Troubles</title><published>2009-02-20T17:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T17:39:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/female_troubles" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/50/110708833_e4d131b94c_m.jpg" alt="the waxing gibbous moon" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;Taboo though it may be, menstruation happens to half the world's population, and some of those it happens to are on the autistic spectrum.  Menstruation can be zero (perhaps negative) fun for many women, and it may come with special annoyances (and a special place in Hell) for people with hyper-sensitivities, hypo-sensitivities, communication difficulties, and a deep dislike of change. A friend of Kristina's recently went looking for information about autism and menstruation to problem solve some difficulties her daughter was having, and found few web resources outside of "what is menstruation" and social stories, and little inclination for people to discuss it with her on message boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll launch here into "funny period stories from Dora's past" followed by some menstruation issues outside of the "social story" realm, but with a cut so those with delicate sensibilities can avoid the, er, mess...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My body developed rather faster than my communication skills did.  So when I started menstruating, I didn't communicate about it to anyone.  I took as few pads as possible from my mother's stash, made extensive use of wadded up tissues, and placed all soiled underwear behind my dresser, which seemed a perfectly reasonable set of actions to me at the time.  Life went on... for several years... until--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been carted off to a girl scout camp (which I hated, but that's another story) nearly 100 miles from home, and was wandering in a vacant confused haze when a councilor, distressed, found me.  "Your parents are here!"  Even with the near-catatonic cluelessness of myself at that moment, I was shocked out of my stupor with the thought, "Oh no, who died!" because, well, why else would my parents drive nearly 100 miles to girl scout camp?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrified, I was lead somewhere.  Terrified, I saw my mother running toward me in a panic.  "I was cleaning your room," my mother gasped, "and I thought you might"--boxes of maxi-pads filled my field of vision--"need &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt;!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, the stories from childhood that only become funny several decades later, heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, that was in part a little of humor to help dispel the taboo, but more seriously, while I knew full well what menstruation "was," my lack of expressive communication created a pretty major problem.  And that wasn't the only major problem.  There was also the issue of the cramps, low blood pressure, and other ill effects which completely confused me on every level.  My internal body sense is very poor, so I would mistake cramps for needing to use the toilet, or (much worse) needing to use the toilet for cramps.  Self care issues with cleanliness were a big problem. On top of that sensory issues with pads were so bad that menstruation was truly a nightmare event.  As I've aged, I've found ways to cope with all of these things, but it would have been much better had I found those ways to cope as a pre-teen rather than as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm no expert on the "female troubles" (outside of my own of course) but at least some items that need to be considered for females on the spectrum and menstruation beyond the "social story" realm are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Communication--communicating about it when it happens, self-advocating for needs related to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Sensory and motor issues with feminine products--tampons or pads, cloth or paper, consideration both of what feels (from a sensory angle) least irritating and is within the person's motor capacity for managing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Internal body sense--managing pain or any other "sickness" associated with menstruation, the distinction between menstruation-related sensations and other body sensations&lt;/p&gt;

A few days later, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Bickerton"&gt;Derek Bickerton&lt;/a&gt; contributed a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1148"&gt;critical commentary&lt;/a&gt;.  Now Tecumseh has sent in a response to Derek — or, perhaps I should say, Prof. Fitch has contributed a response to Prof. Bickerton — which is presented below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[Guest post by W. Tecumseh Fitch]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of my essay, written on Darwin's birthday, was to revive interest in Darwin's long-neglected ideas about language evolution, not to offer (or defend) my own model. Derek Bickerton's critique of Darwin's musical protolanguage model suggests that our hominin ancestors lived out their terrified lives on the treeless savannah, cowed into silence by their many predators.  This "fact" renders absurd, Bickerton claims, Darwin's notion that our ancestors evolved learned, complex vocalizations ("song", for simplicity, hereafter) before language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dubbing Darwin's idea "bizarre" and "absurd," Bickerton reveals his unwillingness to engage in a sympathetic interpretation of the musical protolanguage hypothesis first advanced by Darwin (and others who have followed in his footsteps).  But as philosopher Suzanne Langer observed "The chance that the key ideas of any professional scholar's work are pure nonsense is small; much greater the chance that a devastating refutation is based on a superficial reading or even a distorted one, subconsciously twisted by a desire to refute" (p. ix, Langer, 1962).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here is only to show that Bickerton's interpretation is of this superficial and distorted sort, and because of this and some factual errors cited below, that his attempt at a devastating refutation misses its mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Bickerton misses the central point of Darwin's hypothesis: to explain the origin of &lt;strong&gt;vocal learning&lt;/strong&gt; in the hominid line.  This is an indubitable capacity in our species, indubitably lacking in other apes, and there must be an evolutionary explanation for it.  Although it is possible that vocal learning is a "spandrel", a by-product of some other evolutionary change (e.g. large brains), it does not seem absurd to suppose that this capacity was selected, for some reason or another.  If it was not in the mute Australopithecines of the Bickertonian savanna, and did not play a role in pair- or mother-infant bonding, it must have happened at some other time, for some other reason - but it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin simply, and correctly, observed that the capacity for vocal learning is not uniquely human, but is shared with birds, and it was this central observation upon which he built his theory.  This observation, and the deductions Darwin drew from it, have subsequently been supported by additional comparative data from many species, from hummingbirds to seals and whales, of which Darwin was unaware.  It is true, obviously, that language has many other critical components besides vocal control — vocal learning is one of several speech- and music-related mechanisms in our species, and language per se involves several others in addition (most notably complex syntax and semantics).  But vocal learning did evolve in our species, and Darwin&amp;#39;s hypothesis of an evolutionary route through song is a reasonable one, well-supported by abundant data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the human capacity for music has much in common with language: it is another early-developing trait, found in all human cultures, and Darwin's hypothesis has the virtue of explaining the continued existence of music along with language.  This too, like vocal learning, needs to be explained if we are to understand human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a historical viewpoint, Bickerton's critique is reminisicent of that of Darwin's nemesis, the linguist Max Müller.  It was Müller who began coining the (unfortunately long-lived) nicknames for many models of language evolution, dismissing Darwin's "sing song" theory with the same brief sneer as the older onomatopoeia and interjectional hypotheses, which he nicknamed "bow wow" and "pooh-pooh" (Müller, 1861, 1873)  Turnabout being fair play, Müller's own theory of semi-mystical resonance between words and things was dubbed the "ding dong" theory [(Noiré, 1917)].  Bickerton's "yodelling Australopithecines" image has the same absurd comic flair.  But sneers and derogatory nicknames, however rhetorically effective, are not scientific arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close, I will only point out three key factual errors in Bickerton's critique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)  Maggie Tallerman&amp;#39;s critique of holistic protolanguage has been answered convincingly, point by point, by Kenny Smith recently (Smith, 2008).  In a journal issue that, if I&amp;#39;m not mistaken, Bickerton himself co-edited…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Most paleoanthropologists now agree that the environment in which much of human evolution occurred was not the unitary &amp;quot;savannah&amp;quot; imagined by Bickerton, but an ecologically diverse environment better characterized as &amp;quot;mixed woodlands&amp;quot; (Kingston, Marino, &amp;amp; Hill, 1994).  Our ancestors probably had plenty of trees to climb, and they probably did so regularly, as the lasting arboreal adaptations of the Australopithecines attest.  Indeed it seems likely that Australopithecines built nests in the trees for sleeping, just as do modern chimpanzees and orangutans (Sabater Pi, Veà, &amp;amp; Serrallonga, 1997). Given that all apes persist in using loud vocalizations to stay in contact, for example chimpanzee pant-hoots, it is surprising that someone with an imagination as fertile as Bickerton&amp;#39;s can&amp;#39;t conceive of any function for loud nocturnal vocalizations in early hominins.  He should consult (Mithen, 2005) for some inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Bickerton finds it "absurd" to suppose that a mostly-terrestrial, moderate-sized primate would be highly vocal, producing loud, repetitive vocalizations.  What about &lt;em&gt;Theropithecus gelada&lt;/em&gt;, the grassland living gelada baboon?  These are mostly-terrestrial African primates, preyed upon by leopards, dogs, and humans, and whose fossil remains are also known from Olduvai Gorge.  Geladas are extremely vocal and indeed noted for their vocal complexity (Aich, Moos-Heilen, &amp;amp; Zimmerman, 1990; Richman, 1976), and interestingly are one of the only primates for whom claims have been made of rhythmic, synchronized vocalizations (Richman, 1978, 1987).  Whether Richman&amp;#39;s claims about the musicality of gelada vocalizations hold up or not, there can be no doubt that geladas are highly vocal terrestrial primates, in apparent violation of Bickerton&amp;#39;s evolutionary principles, and who evolved in a grassy, nearly treeless environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most primates, whether arboreal or terrestrial, are highly vocal in at least some circumstances, as are humans today, and I conclude that Bickerton provides no good argument to suppose that hominins have ever been otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the discipline of language evolution is full of questions, and the field is only likely to make empirical progress if practitioners find it in their hearts and heads to sympathetically read, understand and compare multiple hypotheses, even those that initially seem unintuitive or even "absurd".  Far too many unknowns remain about our species' past for Darwin's hypothesis to be dismissed so quickly, on such scant evidence and weak argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially on Darwin&amp;#39;s birthday, and the 150th anniversary of his greatest book…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2006 I gave &lt;i&gt;Silver&lt;/i&gt;, the then latest album from Philadelphia folk rockers Maggi, Pierce and E.J., &lt;a href="http://saltosobrius.blogspot.com/2006/12/album-review-maggi-pierce-ej-silver.html"&gt;a rave review&lt;/a&gt;. Since then the band has put out a collection of covers, a documentary DVD, a side-project duo album, and last fall a new trio album mainly of original songs. I just bought it, and it's great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kahchee Moochee&lt;/i&gt; is named after Pierce's mom's term for good food. It has ten tracks, and the trio's signature eclecticism is much in evidence. There's folk, folk rock, bluegrass, jazz, power pop, boogie rock and punk rock on this disc, there's three-part harmony and there's some serious guitar. Cover tunes have been borrowed from 40s blues man &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Liggins"&gt;Jimmy Liggins&lt;/a&gt;, Australian rockers &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_Gurus"&gt;The Hoodoo Gurus&lt;/a&gt; and an unsigned 80s Stanford college band named &lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;amp;friendID=366575668"&gt;The Druids&lt;/a&gt; (at least I'm guessing it's that Lyle Zimmerman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mpeband.com"&gt;MP&amp;amp;E&lt;/a&gt; are a low-budget outfit -- they may have recorded half of the album in Berlin, but the CD folder is a folded sheet out of a photocopier and the print on the disc looks iffy. But the sound quality -- engineering, production and mixing -- is top notch. Following up on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/savvy_brazilian_musicians_harn.php"&gt;yesterday's blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, MP&amp;amp;E is a fine example of great hard-working underground bands who have little to lose from music piracy. If you&amp;#39;re into folk and power pop -- Essex Green, Big Star, A Camp -- and if you don&amp;#39;t mind every song on an album sounding different, then I suggest you &lt;a href="http://www.mpeband.com/shop.html"&gt;order your own copy of that savoury disc, &lt;i&gt;Kahchee Moochee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! And who knows -- maybe you'll get lucky like me and also receive a free copy of the band's 1995 debut album?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/great_new_eclectic_folk_pop.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/77D2wjgDDDg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235146539126"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_606.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93ba67a2501adbe5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-20T13:29:42Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T13:29:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/P1aJ_e53CxY/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_606.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_606.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_606.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_606.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/P1aJ_e53CxY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235145923646"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a014595cef699dc2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Dr. Jay Gordon: Will you please stop claiming you're not an antivaccinationist?</title><published>2009-02-20T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/7_8bW1-SgFE/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I knew it. I just knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just knew that when I finally decided to come back from my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_death_in_the_family.php"&gt;absence from this blog&lt;/a&gt; that something very unpleasant and sad would be waiting for me. True, there had actually been one very nasty thing that I simply had to deal with a few days ago, but that was a particularly vile and despicable human being who, believe it or not, was not John Best. That is not the case here, although the misinformation being pushed is truly disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, what awaited me upon my decision to come back was posted earlier this week on that repository of antivaccine propaganda, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. Also, not surprisingly, what awaited me had been penned by everybody's favorite pediatrician to the stars' children (especially antivaccine activist Jenny McCarthy's son Evan), namely &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay "Whatever You Do, &lt;em&gt;Don't&lt;/em&gt; Call Me Antivaccine" Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, the man who's been known to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_to_the_stars.php"&gt;parrot the worst antivaccine canards&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/dr_jay_gordon_pediatrician_warrior.php"&gt;penned the foreword to Jenny McCarthy's latest paean to antivaccinationism and autism quackery&lt;/a&gt;, and, who, most recently, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_get_away_from_my_alma_mate.php"&gt;invaded my alma mater with a kinder, gentler version of his nonsense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, Dr. Jay is "not antivaccine." How do I know? He tells us so &lt;em&gt;ad nauseam&lt;/em&gt; whenever it is pointed out that he is the chief physician apologist for the antivaccine movement, of course! Usually he tells us either with outrage or with a hurt, puppy dog demeanor at the perceived injustice of being called out for spewing his nonsense. I've even bent over backwards to try to give Dr. Jay the benefit of the doubt at every opportunity. Indeed, I do believe that Dr. Jay &lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; he is not antivaccine. Unfortunately, what he believes and reality are related only by coincidence. That includes vaccines, and that also includes his self-delusion that he is not "antivaccine." If you don't believe me, get a load of Dr. Gordon's reaction to the recent decision in the Autism Omnibus, in which the special masters roundly and&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1872"&gt; utterly rejected the arguments of the plaintiffs in the first three test cases&lt;/a&gt; (more about that on Monday, unless something more current demands my attention by then). I'm tellin' ya, the dude is closer to sounding unhinged than I've ever seen him, and that anger shatters for me any claim by him that he is not antivaccine. If you think I'm being too harsh, then check out his two posts on HuffPo, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/there-is-no-proof-that-ci_b_167157.html"&gt;"There Is No Proof that Cigarettes Cause Cancer"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/the-vaccine-court-was-wro_b_167374.html"&gt;The Vaccine Court Was Wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even I never would have expected something so unscientific and just plain dumb from Dr. Jay. As much as I think Dr. Gordon is probably a nice guy who cares about his patients, being nice does not excuse one from being taken to task for advocating dangerous pseudoscientific nonsense. Unfortunately, he managed to live down to my expectations and then start digging. With a backhoe. Let's take a look at his&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-gordon/there-is-no-proof-that-ci_b_167157.html"&gt; first bit of idiocy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/dr_jay_gordon_will_you_please_stop_claiming.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/7_8bW1-SgFE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235143191818"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6130">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4df67cf0d7dd775</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="bad astronomy"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="lounge"/><category term="phil plait"/><title type="html">Skepchicks in the Lounge with Phil Plait!</title><published>2009-02-20T15:14:48Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T15:14:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6130" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepchick/SkepchickPodcastIYAPhil.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="58851828"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m pleased to announce that we have finally released another episode of the Skepchick Podcast! This will be the first in a series called &lt;em&gt;Skepchicks in the Lounge&lt;/em&gt;, in which the Skepchicks gather together for drinks and conversation with someone interesting – in this case, we discuss the International Year of Astronomy with Dr. Phil Plait of &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com"&gt;Bad Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;JREF&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this episode came way late, for which I apologize. It is obvious to me that there are greater (evil) forces at work trying to prevent the podcast from hitting its stride, since we encountered technical problems that forced us to re-record the entire show and then our lovely editor and amazing Skepchick A was nearly murdered by a particularly vicious bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’re still a bit wobbly on the whole podcasting thing, and hope to straighten things out in order to achieve maximum awesomeness in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, you can listen and subscribe to the Skepchick Podcast on iTunes, you could subscribe to the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.libsyn.com/rss"&gt;Libsyn RSS&lt;/a&gt;, or you can just &lt;a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepchick/SkepchickPodcastIYAPhil.mp3"&gt;click here to listen to the mp3&lt;/a&gt; in your browser.

He was working with my friend &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/giagia"&gt;Gia&lt;/a&gt; filming an interview with her, and I tagged along (I got to use the clapper to start the clips!). Afterwards we went to a diner and had a great conversation. Gia and I left, and I figured I’d never hear from him again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong! Alom had an idea, and it was a good one: get scientists and science popularizers to write essays and make videos, saying why they thought science was important, and put them on a website called, oddly, &lt;a href="http://whyscience.co.uk/"&gt;Why is Science Important&lt;/a&gt;. Alom asked me to do one, and I kept blowing him off until he I felt way too guilty, so I finally caved and made a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyscience.co.uk/2009/02/phil-plait.php"&gt;It’s now online&lt;/a&gt;, and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love it, hate it? Leave a comment &lt;a href="http://whyscience.co.uk/2009/02/phil-plait.php"&gt;at Alom’s site&lt;/a&gt;! And check out the videos and essays others have sent him. There’s a lot of very good stuff there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7897034.stm?lss"&gt;Two sexes “sin in different ways”&lt;/a&gt; - A new Catholic survey has found that women report pride as their most frequent sin while men have issues with lust and gluttony.  Thanks Russell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1880451,00.html"&gt;Catholics crusade against a mythical bill&lt;/a&gt; -  “There is only one hitch. Congress isn’t about to pass the Freedom of Choice Act — because no such bill has been introduced in the current Congress.” Thanks QuestionAuthority.&lt;/li&gt;
