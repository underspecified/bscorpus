That’s not how it worked out, as people were more interested in talking about the relationship between science and religion.  You can guess what happened — or maybe not.  There was a productive two-hour conversation in which both sides learned something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much the same thing that happened &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/06/06/church-going/"&gt;when I visited a Chicago church&lt;/a&gt; back in the day.  There’s obviously a selection effect at work:  the kinds of churches that invite atheists in for conversations are generally ones that enjoy some kind of open dialogue.  Not that it’s all warm hugs and pleasant disagreement; I noticed that the older generation in my audience was a lot less open to even thinking about some of the points I raised, while Jerry had to fend off someone who thought that math and science had led to Nazi Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerry concludes that the harmful aspects of religion are correlated with the &lt;em&gt;certainty&lt;/em&gt; displayed by its adherents.  This is a true but subtle point, as of course there are those who love to accuse scientists and/or atheists of unwarranted certitude.  I think the difference is that we feel relatively sure about some things, while we’re quite ready to admit that we don’t know the answer to other questions, and we have a clear notion of where the distinction lies.  But I would think that, wouldn’t I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations like these are enormously helpful.  The trick is that it’s much easier — on both sides — to be polite and interactive in person, while the temptation to lecture people from on high is irresistible in other contexts, where it’s easier to think of the opposition as cartoons rather than real people. &lt;/p&gt;

The implication is that conservatives leave their faith and become atheists more often than liberals do. By proxy this shows liberalism is a better brand of Christianity. I suspect both implications are correct. Conservatives have already rejected liberalism as outsiders to liberalism, and for good reasons. So once they reject their own conservative Christianity it's probable that a high number of them eventually become atheists. Unlike former conservatives though, liberals have probably never critically examined their faith from an outsider's perspective, and this makes all the difference. Since liberals believe in less then liberalism is harder to reject, for the less you take on faith the better it is. ;-) Of course, since that's true agnosticism (understood as a position against all metaphysical claims) would be better than liberalism. And atheism (understood as no religious beliefs at all) is the best conclusion of them all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7087692716200443782?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

She suggests that Nabokov&amp;#39;s work may have been dismissed by his contemporaries because his scientific papers were a little too colorfully written.Roger Vila, one of Pierce&amp;#39;s co-authors, suggests that Nabokov&amp;#39;s prose style (Wellsian time machine!) did his hypothesis no favors:The literary quality of his scientific writing, Vila says, may have led to his ideas being overlooked. &amp;quot;The way he explained it, using such poetry -- I think this is the reason that it was not taken seriously by scientists,&amp;quot; Vila says. &amp;quot;They thought it was not &amp;#39;hard science,&amp;#39; let&amp;#39;s say. I think this is the reason that this hypothesis has been waiting for such a long time for somebody to vindicate it.&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a little harsh toward scientists, but it seems plausible: creativity in scientific writing is rarely rewarded.Hyperlink to quoted source sic.

Palmer&amp;#39;s analysis is thoughtful and thorough, and you should read all of it. But she misses what (to me) seems like the best wrinkle in the whole business: Gould, alone of all the scientists, should have been sympathetic to the dangers of writing &amp;quot;too well&amp;quot; in a scientific context. 

Stephen Jay Gould, one suspects, never murdered a single darling in a decades-long career of writing for scientific and popular venues. The  iconoclastic 1979 paper &amp;quot;The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: a critique of the adaptationist programme&amp;quot; [PDF], coauthored with Richard Lewontin, is a case in point. Gould and Lewontin wanted to make the point that not all traits and behaviors of living species are necessarily adaptive—that is, evolved to perform a function that enhances survival and/or reproductive success. Today it is widely agreed that this point needed making. But Gould&amp;#39;s writing undercut the success of his own argument, or at least gave his detractors a toehold for derision.

A metaphor for Gould&amp;#39;s metaphors? Photo by MorBCN.Gould and Lewontin developed their argument with references to architecture and to literature. They compared non-adaptive traits to mosaics decorating the spandrels of the Cathedral of San Marco in Venice. Spandrels being spaces created between arches, anything decorating them is clearly secondary to the architectural decision to build an arch. They also compared &amp;quot;adaptationist&amp;quot; biologists to the character of Dr. Pangloss in Voltaire&amp;#39;s satire Candide, who claims that &amp;quot;all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.&amp;quot; 

Pangloss is a fool, and biologists who felt Gould and Lewontin were critiquing them took the obvious inference. One of the most biting responses to &amp;quot;Spandrels&amp;quot; focused much more on the style than the substance of the paper. The author, David Queller, titled it &amp;quot;The spaniels of St. Marx and the Panglossian paradox: A critique of a rhetorical programme&amp;quot; [PDF], and the parody only continues from there. 

Queller built an elaborate and unflattering image of Gould and Lewontin as Marxists focused on their political perspective like the dog in the old RCA ads fixated on a grammophone. He even referenced one of Gould&amp;#39;s favorite cultural touchstones, the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, to tweak Gould as &amp;quot;the very model of a science intellectual.&amp;quot; Queller manages to have his cake and decry it, too—he mocks Gould and Lewontin with overflown metaphors, then backs off to say that such tactics are irresponsible:So, how did I like my test drive in the supercharged rhetoric-mobile? It&amp;#39;s certainly been fun ... but it&amp;#39;s pretty hard to keep the damned thing on the road. ... my little parody of Gilbert and Sullivan&amp;#39;s modern Major General, who knows about everything but matters military, might induce an uninformed reader to conclude that Gould knows about everything but matters biological. But this is exactly the complaint that many biologists would level at Spandrels—that colorful language can mislead as well as inform.So if Gould&amp;#39;s reading of Nabokov&amp;#39;s scientific achievement was predicated on the opinions of Nabokov&amp;#39;s colleagues, who didn&amp;#39;t care for elaborate prose in their scientific journals, well, I think that&amp;#39;s what my English teachers called irony.

But I wanted to add that after that event in 1986, &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/334-Challenger-Astronauts-Memorialized-on-the-Moon.html"&gt;seven craters on the Moon were named after the astronauts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mosaic of LRO images is about 190 km wide, so these craters are actually quite large. Interestingly, these craters are themselves inside a much larger 524-km wide impact basin… named Apollo.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll just share with you the story behind the artwork:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this might seem to make very little sense at all. Fair enough, it&amp;#39;s sort of supposed to. But this did actually happen to me at work — A guy came in to buy some homeopathic tablets, and was quite insistent that I not let them touch the large tub of ice-cream that he was also purchasing. Assuming that it had something to do with astronomically minute quantities of poison that such remedies are reputed to contain (they don&amp;#39;t, by the by — it is entirely water,) I assured him that there was no threat of contamination.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He then proceeded to explain to me, as a primary school teacher would an infant, that homeopathy works due to molecular vibration. Being a mere layman, I will try to explain this process to the best of my limited ability. The water molecules vibrate with the same resonance as the poisons that give them their efficacy. This in turn causes human molecules to vibrate upon ingestion, curing one's ills. Close contact with the tub of ice-cream will cause the vibrations to shift to the new medium, resulting in an ineffective medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comic does not explain the specific details of homeopathy — it&amp;#39;s more like an artistic rendering of the &lt;i&gt;spirit&lt;/i&gt; of homeopathy. And like all great art, it reveals the deeper truth. In this case, that homeopathy is gullet-gibbering, brain-blitzing insanity that has gone beyond evidence into the realm of childish delusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/how_homeopathy_works_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/LEJ4TjgPaiQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296397811602"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=27524">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebdf629c35b794d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Accommodationism"/><category term="religion"/><title type="html">A confab with the faithful</title><published>2011-01-30T14:29:06Z</published><updated>2011-01-30T14:29:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/a-confab-with-the-faithful/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;People like Elaine Ecklund are always urging scientists to “dialogue” with the faithful, expecting that it will benefit both of them.  (What people like her &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, of course, is not benefits to science but more tolerance of religion.)  I haven’t been averse to such dialogue. Although I certainly don’t think it’s going to improve my science, and have no illusions that I’ll convert religious people in a short conversation, it is a learning experience.  And I just had one yesterday, participating in a discussion group at the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotemple.org/home.php"&gt;First United Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt; of Chicago.  A while back, senior pastor Phil Blackwell emailed me that the church’s reading group would be discussing &lt;em&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/em&gt;, and invited me to join in.  I did so gladly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church itself, located in the Loop of downtown Chicago, is pretty amazing. It’s actually a skyscraper about twenty stories high, with a steeple on top!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27525" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/a-confab-with-the-faithful/chicagotemplefirstunitedmethodistchurch-001/"&gt;&lt;img title="ChicagoTempleFirstUnitedMethodistChurch-001" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/chicagotemplefirstunitedmethodistchurch-001.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=408" alt="" width="300" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never seen a building like this.  The church itself, the oldest Methodist congregation in Chicago (founded in 1821), now occupies a couple of floors in the building, renting out the rest of it for office space.  Scopes lawyer Clarence Darrow—a vociferous atheist—once had his office on the sixth floor!  And Phil and his family live in the steeple—what a great job perk!  There’s also a “sky chapel” at the top, said to be the highest place of worship in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, the discussion was supposed to be about my book, so I expected to talk a lot about evolution. It didn’t turn out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion group actually has a topic: the interface between science and religion.  And that’s what we talked about.  (It always turns out that discussions of my book, when not rigorously guided away from the topic of religion, always wind up dealing with science and faith.  That’s been my experience talking not just to laypeople, but also to college and high school classes.  That’s fine by me, for thanks to the Gnu Atheists religion is on many people’s minds, and I welcome the chance to speak my mind.  Besides, I’ve given elebenty gazillion talks on my book and it’s &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I showed up I had resolved to keep pretty mum about my views on religion—after all, I was addressing twenty religious people who were kind enough to buy and discuss my book. But that resolve lasted only about thirty seconds!  How could I sit by when people made the familiar arguments that science and faith are separate magisteria, that atheism and science were responsible for Nazi Germany, that parts of the Bible were metaphorical fictions while others weren’t, and so on?  To not say my piece would have been intellectual dishonesty.  But, to be sure, I tried to be calm and respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion lasted two hours, and while a &lt;em&gt;rapprochement&lt;/em&gt; obviously wasn’t reached, I did learn a lot.  Here are some of my outtakes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the church members were liberal, urban Methodists, apparently well off, they were obviously not raving fundamentalists.  Their approach to faith was far more “nuanced” (I hate that word!) and circumspect.  Several of them struck me as being a hairsbreadth from atheism, seeing God as some kind of distant entity who neither concerns himself with the world nor was even involved in creating it.  In fact, they spent a fair amount of time denigrating  fundamentalists like Southern Baptists, reassuring me that they disliked those folks more than I did!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was obvious that for these folks, one of the most important aspects of church membership was a sense of community—and the opportunity to do something to help other people. The church has various intellectual activities (like the reading group), outreach programs like an ecology group, and it feeds the homeless.  All of this is obviously good: this is one of those churches for which it’s hard to say that, on balance, they create more harm than good.  But the question, as always, is this:  is the doctrine that brings these people together really &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;? I think for some of them it doesn’t matter, but I wonder how many of these people would even belong to the Church if they knew absolutely that Jesus was not the son of God and that the Resurrection never happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All atheists recognize that one of the vital functions performed by churches is social—to bring people together and make them feel part of a movement greater than themselves, or simply to be part of a community whose members care about each other.  It also enables them to work together to help others. I appreciate this function, and realize that—as Phil Kitcher always emphasizes—any viable atheist community must somehow satisfy the need for this kind of social interaction.  In the discussion, several people implied that religion was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to provide that. I responded that Europe is doing pretty well without religion, and that Europeans have somehow met the need for community without a need for God.  (&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/does-insecurity-promote-faith/"&gt;Greg Paul’s work&lt;/a&gt; suggests that simply having a secure society, one with medical care, social security, low crime, and the like, serves to dissolve the need for faith.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With respect to the inevitability of religion, a couple of people claimed that “religion will always be with us,” since it’s been part of humanity ever since the Neandertals buried their dead with ornaments and ochre pigments.  I think the idea was simply that religious belief is inherent in the human brain (having either been directly instilled by evolution or as a byproduct of our complex brains and intelligence).  My response was that, of course, much of the world is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; religious.  The work of &lt;a href="http://atheism.110mb.com/"&gt;Phil Zuckerman&lt;/a&gt;, surveying belief around the world, shows that in many countries the incidence of atheism is between 40% and 85%.  Countries like France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Japan can be taken as largely secular, and they’re not appreciably more immoral or insecure than America.  I pointed out that religion appears highly correlated with both poverty and insecurity, and perhaps reducing those will help “get rid of religion”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the discussants asked me how I’d deal with a fundamentalist who simply rejected evolution outright because it contravened the Bible. I said that in such a case that there was nothing to do.  My own strategy for promoting evolution, I said, had evolved into trying to “get rid of religion,” which is the source of creationism, and far worse things besides.  I believe that statement shocked some folks, but I hastened to add that the types of religion I was most concerned with eliminating were those that promoted Biblical literalism or had invidious effects on society, like promoting suicide bombing, repression of women, and prohibition of birth control.  I doubt that these Methodists fit into those categories!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The discussion was generally pleasant.  The only distressing part was one woman who insisted that Hitler and the Nazis could be directly traced to prewar Germany’s emphasis on science and math, and its pervasive atheism. I made the standard counterarguments: that Hitler really wasn’t an atheist, that math and science are big in Japan and Denmark but there aren’t any Holocausts there, that the persecution of the Jews can be traced directly to religion, and so on.  The woman was apparently one of those folks who see religion as a bulwark against immorality and persecution.  My response was simply to point again to modern Europe.  When I got home last night, I found an email from one of the other discussants, thanking me for my presence and adding, “I beg of you, please do not write that Methodists believe math and science led to Nazi Germany!”  So let me add that only one person espoused that view!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “different ways of knowing” trope arose several times.  One person compared religion to poetry (i.e., an emotional response to the world) and science to prose (a rational and empirical approach to the world).  I mentioned—and this was difficult to say before such a group—that I didn’t think that religion was a way of knowing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;: that different religions had different dogmas and different answers to questions like “What is the proper place of a woman in society?” What, then, is the “knowledge” to be gained? If any of the church members read this post, and I suspect some of them will, I’d ask them to consider what religion really helps us “know”, and how can Methodists be confident that what they “know” is true while the different things “known” by Muslims, Hindus, and Southern Baptists are &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same lady who blamed science and math on Hitler raised the point that there was a commonality to the “truths” of faiths—they were monotheistic.  I pointed out that many faiths, like Hinduism, were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; monotheistic, so even that is not a “truth”.  Moreover, when you get beyond the “one god” idea, faiths rapidly diverge in their other “truths”. Yes, they all pay lip service to the Golden Rule, but clearly Muslims don’t treat all other Muslims as they want to be treated themselves! And religions diverge on many important issues like sex, birth control, and treatment of gays and women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To me, one of the most interesting parts of the discussion involved interpreting the Bible.  One gentleman claimed that, of course, stories like Genesis were metaphorical fiction, an attempt of preliterate people to make sense of the world without empirical tools for studying it.  I agreed with him (adding that he  probably also believed that Adam and Eve and the story of Noah were metaphors), but pointed out that he may have been treating the Bible unequally.  Why are stories like Genesis and Noah so obviously fictional, and yet stories like the divinity and resurrection of Jesus are seen as &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;: the bedrock foundations of Christian belief?  To me, this is the most difficult question for liberal religious folks. In fact, one woman asked Pastor Blackwell to respond to this point.  Phil basically confessed, I think, that he didn’t have good reasons to think that Jesus’s divinity and resurrection were true in a literal sense, but that even if they were fictional they did not (and I quote him here) “affect the timeless and boundless truths around the life of Jesus.” Of course I’m not sure what those truths &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, but so be it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, one thing that impressed me very strongly about the group was its sense of &lt;em&gt;doubt&lt;/em&gt;.  Just as we scientists can’t be absolutely confident that what we discover are timeless and unalterable truths, so several of these Methodists said they weren’t so sure about the “truths” of the Bible, or, importantly, about the nature of God.  (The difference between scientific and religious doubt is, of course, that scientists have good ways to &lt;em&gt;resolve&lt;/em&gt; doubt.)  While this doubt was not ubiquitous, I’m sure I wouldn’t have sensed it in, say, a confab with Southern Baptists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it struck me that the harmful and destructive nature of faiths may be correlated with how much doubt resides in their adherents.  These Methodists, unsure about the nature—or perhaps even the existence—of God, are certainly not wreaking much harm on the world. Indeed, with their outreach programs, help for the poor, and so on, their net effect on the world may be positive.  (Also, they seemed like &lt;em&gt;nice people&lt;/em&gt;—people trying to live their lives according to the morality they derive from faith).  This is not the kind of faith that I spend a lot of time attacking, even though I consider their religious beliefs—insofar as they even &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; religious beliefs—largely irrational.  And I’m not sure how much their own belief enables beliefs of more harmful faiths, like Islam or fundamentalist Christianity.  My impression is that most of these people are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enablers in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destructive nature of faith stems from &lt;em&gt;certainty&lt;/em&gt;: certainty that you know God’s will and God’s mind.  It’s that certainty that leads to suicide bombing, repression of women and gays, religious wars, the Holocaust, burning of witches, banning of birth control, repression of sex, and so on.  The more doubt in a faith, the less likely its adherents are to do harm to others.  These Methodists seem riddled with doubt, and that defuses potential harm. But though they may doubt the nature of God and the truth of scripture, they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doubt the value of helping others, and that prompts their many charitable acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, I was asked by Pastor Blackwell to provide a “topic sentence,” a short precis of my view on the discussion.  I said something like this:  Everyone claims that a dialogue between scientists and the faithful will be useful to both of them.  I’m not sure I agree.  Certainly my own scientific research is not helped at all by talking to religious people.  How could it be?  And while scientists &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have something of value to say to the faithful, that is only our empirical research that disproves religious dogma.  Nevertheless, these discussions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; of value, if only to inform each other where we stand.  I, for one, learned some useful things about liberal Christianity and was glad I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Pastor Blackwell and his group for inviting me! If any church members read this, do feel free to comment below; you can do so anonymously if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

You often see the date as 50,000 years ago and most people seem to think that this was a sudden event associated with the destruction of ancient hominids (Neandertal, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/span&gt;) who lived in Asia and Europe at this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recent date was based largely on mitochondrial DNA sequences and it required a reliable time reference that just wasn't there. As other nuclear genes were analyzed the dates indicated much older migrations. Then there's the fossil evidence. I'm not able to judge that evidence but it didn't seem to me to be as neat and tidy as a sudden exodus at 50,000 years ago would require.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately we have John Hawks, a scientist who's area of expertise covers archeology AND population genetics. He thinks that the date for "Out of Africa" should be older and he can back up his skepticism with evidence. Read his latest posting at: &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/archaeology/middle/jebel-faya-2011.html"&gt;Jebel Faya and early-stage reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Will the new date end up being 100,000 years ago—or maybe even 150,000 years ago?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since John doesn't allow comments on his blog I thought I'd open up some discussion here. John, aside from the question of modern &lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;, when did Neandertals leave Africa and when was the migration of &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt;? How secure are those dates?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TUVztZ9Po8I/AAAAAAAAK8g/NlVPCw_j7C0/s1600/tmp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:400px;height:284px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TUVztZ9Po8I/AAAAAAAAK8g/NlVPCw_j7C0/s400/tmp.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;P.S.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="http://news.travel.aol.com/2011/01/28/toy-soldier-gun-causes-flap-at-london-airport/"&gt;Canadian woman&lt;/a&gt; Jerry posted about (&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/annals-of-airline-security-part-ii/"&gt;Annals of airline security: Part  II&lt;/a&gt;), I was able to bring a toy soldier &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/annals-of-airline-security-part-ii/"&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;nto the passenger cabin on a plane, last spring at Washington National airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27550" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/tsa-approved-toy-soldier/dscn5750/"&gt;&lt;img title="Britains toy soldier, Fredericksburg NMP, Va., 2010" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dscn5750-e1296393969176.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=424" alt="" width="500" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britains toy soldier, purchased at Fredericksburg National Military Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why he made it through, but here are some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His weapons (a sword and probably a Colt Army 1860 revolver) are less deadly than an SA 80 rifle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He’s smaller than the British toy soldier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The security officials didn’t notice it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The security officials were rational.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britains"&gt;Britains&lt;/a&gt; is a well known British toy soldier maker. It’s undergone corporate vicissitudes, may now be owned by Americans, and the soldiers are now made in China.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Qasr Nil lion is celebrating a little early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those without a classical education, Wikipedia &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_over"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Game Over is a traditional message in video games which usually signals the game has ended with a negative outcome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Wildass1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Wildass2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by the name of the establishment, I wondered just what sort of services Wild Ass Homestay offers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to keep in mind is that there really is a wild equid (&lt;a href="http://www.ultimateungulate.com/perissodactyla/equus_kiang.html"&gt;Equus hemionus subsp. kiang&lt;/a&gt;), popularly referred to as the "Wild Ass," that roams over the Tibetan plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next task was to read the Tibetan correctly.  One correspondent rendered it thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;rkyang&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;mgon khang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;&lt;em&gt;rkyang&lt;/em&gt; means a Kyang or Wild Ass.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;mgon&lt;/em&gt; means protector or refuge.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;khang&lt;/em&gt; means home or house&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;mgon+khang&lt;/em&gt; means a chapel housing images of the fierce protectors, a protector temple. But that may not be the meaning in this case. Probably "a protection home for kyang" or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other correspondents corrected that as follows:  &lt;em&gt;rkyang mgron-khang&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;rkyang&lt;/em&gt; means "wild ass; wild donkey" and &lt;em&gt;mgron-khang &lt;/em&gt;signifies a hotel (general term).  Hence, &lt;em&gt;rkyang mgron-khang&lt;/em&gt; would mean something like Wild Ass Hotel / Guest House.  Usually, however, this would not be a grand affair.  As one Tibetologist put it, "I do not think it is a quaint little Tibetan inn cozily nestled betwixt snowy peaks with a sparkling brook purling under your rooms. It will be a hole in the wall, well, maybe just a hole without a wall!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hill wrote back later to describe in more detail what the Wild Ass Homestay he stayed in was actually like:  "It was just a temporary or, at best, a seasonal structure, made of second-hand Indian army parachutes with a little dabba [VHM:  box]  in the front and some low raised 'couches' around the main eating area covered with Tibetan carpets, with a few more in a sort of alcove off the back which one could hire to sleep on."  "I think it had been hastily erected by nearby 'settled Tibetan nomads' to take advantage of the sudden increase of traffic because of the road closures. They also had an assortment of animal bones and skulls placed around which added to the forlorn atmosphere."  "It was near a village called Tsokar, a rather bleak place next to a salt lake where nomads have been settled on the western edge of the Changthang [VHM:  name of a high plateau in northern and western Tibet that extends into southeastern Ladakh], and somewhere to the south of the lake known as Tsomoriri, which is a popular tourist destination."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story:  words are often deceptive; better to check out the premises first-hand before booking a room.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s the sort of anti-gay bigotry we’ve all come to expect from the Christian world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the backlash against school officials has been overwhelming.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the school announced they would be &lt;a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/story/13914815/belmont-adds-sexual-orientation-to-non-discrimination-policy"&gt;adding sexual orientation into their non-discrimination policy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A new clause has been added to the anti-discrimination policy which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. The change came after more than a month conducting focus groups and interviews on the topic of sexual orientation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds all well and good, but how will this be put into practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not very optimistic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While the wording in Belmont’s mission statement has changed, [University President] Dr. [Bob] Fisher wasn’t able to explain whether or not University policy will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter Amanda Hara said, “You’re saying that you want to be tolerant of people with different sexual orientations but yet you won’t tell us if people are allowed to be openly gay and work here?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not responding you can go ahead and ask that about three different times and the same answer every time,” President Fisher responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m just giving you an opportunity to be transparent,” Amanda Hara replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Fisher went on to say “Well thank you very much.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good is a “non-discrimination policy” if the university president can’t even say whether GLBT people can get a job there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, the Tennessee Baptist Convention is &lt;a href="http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=34527"&gt;pissed off about the apparent lip-service&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“For decades Tennessee Baptists poured themselves into making Belmont what it is,” Randy Davis, executive director of the Tennessee Baptist Convention, told Baptist Press. “&lt;strong&gt;We did sever ties in 2007, but many of us never dreamed that the school would walk away so rapidly from their Christian heritage and roots.&lt;/strong&gt; My heart is broken for all of the Tennessee Baptists that have loved and invested themselves in Belmont over the years. Many of our strongest leaders today are Belmont graduates, and the sentiment that I am hearing from them is one of outrage.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, those honorable Christian roots that make you want to fire someone who’s in love with another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t be convinced a change has been made until an openly gay person is hired by the school.  I doubt Dr. Fisher has the courage to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;

We&amp;#39;re going to kick it off with an anthropology paper that uses a cross-cultural approach to study the origins of human punishment and cooperation.

If you&amp;#39;re not familiar with this vein of research, let me set the stage for you. The &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; of cooperation when people talk about it in anthropology, biology, and economics is this. If you take a super naive view of natural selection, it would say that we should have evolved to ruthlessly pursue our own self interest. In particular, if we have an opportunity to cheat and get away with it, the logic of self interest suggests that we should. From this perspective, the whole idea of successfully engaging in collective action seems absurd.

Contrary to this naive expectation, we observe that people do forego opportunities to pursue their own narrow self interest, and the history of civilization is one of successful collective action on an enormous scale.

The PSA warned about the "dangers" of the flu vaccine, right in the middle of flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Elyse Anders, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/12/hey-facebook-get-my-face-down/"&gt;a Skepchick blogger&lt;/a&gt;, mom and vaccine advocate, rallied her supporters to email AMC asking them to drop the PSA. After recieving hundreds of responses, AMC did the right thing and dropped the PSA. But AoA decided to start a smear campaign against Anders, putting her Facebook picture on their wall, accompanied by threats, insults and general nastiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite reports of abuse, Anders wasn't initially able to get FB to remove the picture, even though the comment stream listed her full name, place of employment and personal threats. So, Anders recruited her legion of Skepchick followers, and a &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/view/tell_facebook_dont_allow_age_of_autism_to_continue_their_harmful_smear_campaign"&gt;Change.org petition asking FB to remove the picture gathered over 800 signatures in just two days.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked. The picture and vicious comments are gone from AoA's wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a victory, but in all likelyhood, it's not a stand-alone incident. As noted on the blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/12/the_age_of_autism_counterattack_begins_a.php"&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt;, which frequently covers anti-vaccination groups, the Age of Autism's "modus operandi has always been, when confronted with criticism or resistance to their anti-vaccine message, to attack the messenger, something they are quite accomplished at."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vax groups will continue to assert, &lt;a href="http://health.change.org/blog/view/is_the_vaccine-autism_debate_finally_over"&gt;with no scientific backing&lt;/a&gt;, that vaccines are the cause of autism and other ills, and sway others into forgoing prevention tool that has saved countless lives. So it was necessary, indeed crucial, to speak out against the rampant spread of misinformation and the personal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to all those who signed the petition and stood up for the commonsense logic of vaccinations in particular, and science-minded thinking in general, around the web.&lt;/p&gt;

Their findings show that kids exposed to the preservative as babies or prenatally were not more likely to develop autism, a finding supported by numerous &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;. Will this finally put an end to the anti-science, anti-vaccination rhetoric? Don't hold your breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/05/1-in-4-parents-buys-unpro_n_487912.html"&gt;one in four parents&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. still believes that vaccination will raise their child's risk of developing autism. And it's not just concern; many parents are foregoing vaccines altogether. Lack of vaccination likely contributed to this past summer's &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ColdandFlu/whooping-cough-epidemic-california-lax-vaccination-blame/story?id=11000305"&gt;whooping cough epidemic&lt;/a&gt; in California, which killed eight infants.  Intentionally unvaccinated school-age children also contributed to the 2008 &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125570056"&gt;measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the misinformation become so prevalent? The whole autism-vaccine link was put to speculation back in 1998, when Andrew Wakefield, a doctor in Britain, published an article showing that eight children developed autism-like symptoms after being vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella (the MMR vaccine). The paper was published in the highly-repsected journal the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, and it opened the floodgates for concerns over the causal link between vaccines and autism. Anectodal reports of children coming down autism symptoms shortly after vaccinations were widely publicized. Celebrities like &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; helped promote the idea that vaccines cause autism. Lawsuits were filed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the science refuting the shaky hypothesis started to emerge. Over a dozen epidemiological studies have failed to find a link between autism and vaccines. In May, Dr. Wakefield was found guilty of &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704113504575263994195318772.html"&gt;"serious professional misconduct,"&lt;/a&gt; including taking blood samples for his study from children at his son's birthday party (generally a big no-no in the medical ethics community). His medical license was revoked. It also came to light that his original research was funded by lawyers for the parents suing the vaccine makers. Conflict of interest, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final nail in the coffin came when the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; retracted Wakefield's original study after concluding that he conducted dishonest and unethical work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courts have also denied any claims of causality. On August 27th, a federal appeals court upheld a ruling that vaccines are not the cause of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study can't completely refute a hypothesis, but this new paper adds to the overwhelming, scientifically-credible research showing no link between autism and vaccination. Yet emotionally-charged misinformation is hard to rectify-- and so the debate isn't likely to end anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

The widely discredited study is blamed for starting not only a contentious debate about whether to vaccinate children, but for a rise in measles among children whose parents were scared away from the MMR shot. Officially referred to as "Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children," the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study became shorthand for the suspected link between childhood vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders that affect development and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://press.thelancet.com/wakefieldretraction.pdf"&gt;terse statement&lt;/a&gt; released today, the editors of the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; write, "The claims in the original paper ... have been proven to be false. Therefore we fully retract this paper from the published record."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only surprise is how long the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; waited to denounce the study. Editors had previously said that they never should have published it after ten of the study's 13 co-authors &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35197332/ns/health-mental_health/"&gt;renounced it&lt;/a&gt;. The study was primarily authored by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who is now based in the U.S and stands by his research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Britain's General Medical Council ruled that Wakefield showed a "callous disregard" for children and brought the medical profession "into disrepute" by promulgating his theory of a link between vaccines and autism. Wakefield and the two other co-authors who have refused to renounce the research face being stripped of their medical credentials in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield failed to randomize his subjects in the original study, going so far as to pay children at his son's birthday party &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18447-damning-verdict-on-doctor-who-linked-mmr-and-autism.html"&gt;$8 for blood samples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While autism makes us different, autistic rights is really about those things we all need, autistic or not, disabled or not, minority or not: food and shelter, respect and love, and empowerment to live our own lives in freedom, happiness, and health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the point I've hoped to make with each post, the perspective I've wished to share.  The change I've wanted to initiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is deeply satisfying then that this blog itself will be changing to better reflect the AR = DR = HR equation, as autism-specific blogging merges into broader Disability Rights blogging at change.org in the future.  This is As It Should Be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as my own future, I'll be doing some public blogging still (though with much, much, MUCH less frequency and after a short break) on &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/blog"&gt;ASAN's change.org blog&lt;/a&gt; (and who knows where else).  I'll also be starting a new appointment with the &lt;a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20090731/NEWS/907310336/1001"&gt;Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder&lt;/a&gt; (remember &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=salem+raymaker"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;?)--my first real experience with public service and something that would have been literally unimaginable to myself not so long ago.  I'll be continuing my advocacy work with &lt;a href="http://autisticadvocacy.org"&gt;ASAN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://asksaal.org"&gt;SAAL&lt;/a&gt;.  And primarily I'll be working on community based research with &lt;a href="http://aaspire.org"&gt;AASPIRE&lt;/a&gt;, which, believe it or not, has been my "day job" all along.  Somewhere in all this, here's hoping I'll facilitate some change in the overall direction of better civil rights and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;This is my last post here at the autism blog at Change.org. I relate why more towards the end. As this is my final word here, I wanted to focus on a topic that Dora and I think is important to note in writing about autism and disability, the need for critical thinking. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now find me at my website &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com"&gt;kristinachew.com&lt;/a&gt; and my new blog, &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/vox/vox.html"&gt;We Go With Him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time I had a very different life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, I taught freshman composition at a large Catholic university here in New Jersey (and, briefly, for another prominent institution of higher learning here). I was trained to teach Classics---the culture and history of the ancient Greeks and Romans---and to translate ancient Greek and Latin. I took the composition jobs because I needed to: My husband and I had just packed up and moved back to Jim's native New Jersey from St. Louis, to find the best education for our son Charlie. I first found a 0.333 position teaching Latin at a local public high school and then phoned in to say I wouldn't be able to take it, as I'd gotten a part-time position teaching composition (with benefits). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students had to write a research essay and this meant I always had to devote one class to "Using Internet Sources." I'd go through the differences between .com, .org, .edu, .info and then show how you can't always judge a website by its "dot whatever." Like many professors, I did not allow students to use Wikipedia as a source on their papers (I still don't). We talked about peer-reviewed journals and used the library's numerous electronic databases. Students ended up with lists of bibliographical sources, URLs, and maybe the printed-out full text of a few articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them didn't realize, that their real work began at this point: It's one thing to have a pile of research. It's another thing to read through all of it. And it's yet another to evaluate all that information, to synthesize and analyze and go beyond one's gut reactions and what just "made sense" or "seemed right." Especially when you encounter a source that makes an argument contrary to what you are convinced is right, you must demonstrate that you can, thoughtfully and carefully, evaluate the claims on their own terms, and turn a critical eye on your own views and even your own experience. You must look at the language the writer uses and at how they use the words: Is there rhetoric meant to attract a reader's sympathy? How does the writer use her or his sources---does she or he clearly and accurately represent their theses?   Is there irony or obfuscation? You must go and look up the original sources rather than relying only on second- or third-party opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I often found very difficult to explain to my students was the difference between writing an essay using such critical thinking skills, and more of a response or reaction paper. Very often, students struggled to make arguments based on a careful synthesis of the ideas in their sources. They made arguments that were more akin to opinions and plugged in the sources only if they clearly supported their points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many discussions about autism, research, and science, on the Internet and elsewhere, the same sort of thing happens for reasons that are more than understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of June, I've been blogging about autism every day for four years. I started writing daily accounts of our son Charlie on a blog called &lt;i&gt;My Son Has Autism&lt;/i&gt; that became &lt;i&gt;Autismland&lt;/i&gt;. I shied away from writing about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10_autism_controversies"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt;. But when I started writing &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com"&gt;Autism Vox&lt;/a&gt; and focused more on science and health topics, I quickly found myself blogging about one "hot topic"---&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_vaccine-autism_scare_panic_in_the_wrong_place"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;---after another. While I've tried to focus more on issues of education and policy here at &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org"&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt;, those "hot topics" have inevitably come up as one follows the latest in the media about autism. There is a lot---an Internet's worth---of information out there. It's become almost too easy to compile lists of sources and links and URLs, to read blog posts and Tweets and articles about all those "hot topics" and to pass them on to support the position one is taking. I know; I do it myself, though I certainly try to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;evaluate science&lt;/a&gt; and other sources for what they say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And often in the heat of the moment, when we're trying to make a point---that something "caused autism" in a child or that a certain "treatment" is producing miraculous results---we just provide the information without sifting through and analyzing, and reflecting, and discerning, where our &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/vaccines_and_autism_a_matter_of_the_heart"&gt;emotions are seeping&lt;/a&gt; into our views. When you're writing in the ever-changing environment of the Internet and when you're a parent honestly desperate to find &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; to help your child  and to find &lt;i&gt;support&lt;/i&gt; for why you're doing the crazy things you're doing, information that says just what you want it to say is hard to resist. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know. Like many parents, I &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/once_upon_a_time_i_tried_to_recover_my_son_from_autism"&gt;once tried to recover my son from autism&lt;/a&gt;, as I wrote in one my first posts here on Change.org. It's not easy to apply your critical thinking skills in the press of life, when you've just dragged yourself and your child back into the house after snatching him out of the path of a car in a McDonalds parking lot and been upbraided by random strangers who were in no mood to hear your explanation of how you don't know why your son started knocking his head at the top of the tube slide in the McPlayPlace because he can't talk and it wasn't a moment to pull out the PECS book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie doesn't do that sort of thing anymore (though we do go to McDonalds when he asks for it and, occasionally, to a McPlayPlace). He can somewhat tell us, in various ways (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_arent_all_theyre_cracked_up_to_be"&gt;not always words&lt;/a&gt;) what's bothering him, and Jim and I have learned to understand his communications much better by &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/camp_charlie"&gt;spending so much time with him&lt;/a&gt;. It's from all that time, from watching Charlie, that we've learned what treatments, therapies, and educational/teaching methods seem to work best for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting a child like Charlie means that you have to use your critical thinking skills. As my friend Shannon writes, you have to be able to &lt;a href="http://www.blogher.com/identifying-and-avoiding-autism-cults"&gt;identify and avoid autism cults&lt;/a&gt;. You've got to get your strategy together to advocate for your child at &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime_iep_time"&gt;IEP meetings&lt;/a&gt; and get the school district to do the right thing &lt;i&gt;for your child&lt;/i&gt;. You've go to be able to analyze, in a split second, why your child just got so upset in a place that he likes: &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_time_of_perpetual_transitions_adolescence"&gt;Hormones&lt;/a&gt;? Stomachache? &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th"&gt;Too much noise&lt;/a&gt;? Bad day at school? Something we parents (with all good intentions) said or did? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often say, figuring out how to take care of Charlie has been the biggest challenge I've ever faced, more than any exam I ever had to take in college or graduate school. Writing about this journey of Jim's and my life with Charlie has been the bread and butter of my blogging; it's certainly the basis for my very-much-in-progress-book about Charlie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my last post on the autism blog at Change.org. In time this blog will morph into one about disability and disability rights, and I'm very pleased at this future transformation. As Charlie has gotten older, more and more of the issues that affect him---issues of employment, housing, transportation, support staff---overlap with disability issues more generally. Dora's and my posts will remain on Change.org and be integrated in the new blog. I think the almost eight months of blogging that we've done here comprise a nice oeuvre, a small archive of articles about key issues pertaining to autism and disability, from the perspectives of a self-advocate and of a parent. I have been particularly happy about the blog when Dora and I ended up posting on the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/sensory_processing_movement_and_brainz"&gt;same&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/proprioception_and_the_brain"&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes on the same day), but with our different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will still be &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/vox/vox.html"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; over at my website, &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/kc.html"&gt;kristinachew.com&lt;/a&gt;. My new blog is called &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/vox/vox.html"&gt;We Go With Him&lt;/a&gt;, and I've included sections on &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/kc.html"&gt;my site&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/on_autism.html"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; to my writing on various topics &lt;a&gt;here and on Autism Vox, as well as a section about &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/homemade.html"&gt;teaching Charlie&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to let &lt;a href="http://www.kristinachew.com/Site/vox/vox.html"&gt;We Go With Him&lt;/a&gt; evolve as I write it. Certainly some posts will chronicle our continue efforts to find a school for Charlie. While still following all those "hot topics" about autism and occasionally commenting on them (I just can't resist), I'll most likely be focusing on writing about being on the road with Charlie.&lt;br&gt;

Thank you so very much for your readership, for letting us know what you think and for your support, which has meant a great deal. Back in December when I started writing this blog, Charlie was &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;struggling mightily&lt;/a&gt; and Jim and I found ourselves facing some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;hard and terrible questions&lt;/a&gt;. Things have been &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;looking up on the docks&lt;/a&gt; and Charlie has been well, very well, and we've been having a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/camp_charlie"&gt;wonderful summer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life on the long road with Charlie is not easy, most of all for him. Life with Charlie is always very, very good for Jim and me because we have each other, because Charlie is with us, and because we're one &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;tight team of three&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

We've had an occasional series of international guest bloggers here from &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?guest_blogger_id=83"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?guest_blogger_id=119"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?guest_blogger_id=81"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?guest_blogger_id=168"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?guest_blogger_id=82"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?guest_blogger_id=231"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. My own understanding about autism and disability took on a focus beyond the US after I went on a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;trip to Greece&lt;/a&gt; with some of my students back in March. While there, I met &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/three_mothers"&gt;two mothers&lt;/a&gt;: Emma's son Dimitri has &lt;a href="http://angelmanforum.org/"&gt;Angelman Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and she blogs at &lt;a href="http://theironchicken.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Iron Chicken&lt;/a&gt;. Marilena's son is Ρίκος and she blogs at &lt;a href="http://autismos.blogspot.com/"&gt;Τι λέει το πρόγραμμα?&lt;/a&gt;, which I have been doing my best to follow (with the happy side-effect of helping me to learn Modern Greek).  Emma has a &lt;a href="http://theironchicken.blogspot.com/2009/07/special-olympics-athens-2011.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://www.athens2011.org/gr/about.asp?menuid=5"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, whose World Summer Games will be hosted in Athens in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emma notes that she feels "irritated, and occasionally out-right angry" about this and for reasons that I share, and have somewhat expressed in two of my own &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_olympics_for_who_i"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_olympics_for_who_ii"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. It's not the ideas and the philosophy the Special Olympics that irk but, as Emma cogently writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The irritation stems from the knowledge that Greek politicians are going to being doing their photo opportunities and making their postive statements about inclusion and acceptance and the progress that Greece has made etc, etc, etc, when in fact they are doing pretty much.....nothing towards inclusion and acceptance or anything else regarding disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I'm sure that every country which participates in the Special Olympics also have incidents of discrimination, neglect and abuse towards people with disabilites, I can't help but wonder where &lt;a href="http://theironchicken.blogspot.com/2009/05/no-funny-anecdotes.html"&gt;Nikos&lt;/a&gt;, a boy with Down Syndrome who is currently living in an institution in appalling conditions, will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to that a comment I read on facebook group &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=172583000183&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Mental Disability - Eimai diaforetikos... e, kai?&lt;/a&gt; about children with autism being excuded from the Special Olympics in Kastoria because "the children with autism are particularly aggressive and have the tendency to be distant", I'm left asking myself whether Greece is ready to host the Special Olympics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope...I hope many things. I hope the Special Olympics will help to dispell some of the myths and stigma which still surround intellectual disability, I hope that people will be encouraged to take more of an interest in what is going on around them, to people in the their own country. And of course I hope that the athletes participating in the Special Olympics have a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my feelings of confusion and irritation are misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm completely with Emma here. Charlie loves being active and excels at bike-riding and swimming, and we've been hopeful about Charlie participating in the Special Olympics. The reality of having him be on a team and/or participate in activities has been much more of a challenge in itself. I remain hopeful that Charlie might one day participate but I also want to make sure that has indeed has a "great time" and that the focus isn't on the competition, but his participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Emma, I hope indeed that my own "feelings of confusion and irritation are misplaced."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296366691847"><id gr:original-id="http://news.change.org/stories/leverage">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b8647310c76747d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Leverage</title><published>2009-07-30T17:51:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-30T17:51:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/stories/leverage" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="00-lever" src="http://change-production.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/wordpress_copies/autism/2010/04/00-lever.jpg" height="240" alt="" width="180"&gt;There is a concept in the systems field called "leverage."  Leverage is the part of a system where a small change has the largest potential to impact the whole.  As a simple example, if a person treats the symptoms of an infection with pain killers, the state of the infection doesn't really change much; there is little change in the whole system.  However, if a person treats an infection with antibiotics, not only does the state of the infection change dramatically, but the symptoms of the infection go away as well; there is large change in the whole system.  The leverage in that example is in the infection, not in the symptoms of the infection.  Leverage points are rarely in the place that seems most obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the purpose of this change.org site is to create change.  Change in individual perspectives and paradigm.  Change toward less assumptions, toward more respect, toward a better understanding.  Change on a public, universal level in policy that supports respect, opportunity, equality, and quality of life.  Discussion, action, the social-sharing-medium of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do wonder sometimes--where, really, is the leverage?  If we want public attitudes toward autism to shift away from medical-deficit models and toward social-strength models, if we want public perception of autism issues to be as human rights issues, then where is the greatest point of impact?  The media?  The government?  Each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much leverage is there in blog posts?  In the discussion that comes from blog posts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much leverage in emailing a legislator, or a public figure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much leverage is there in one single person perceiving old things in new ways, and telling all their friends?  And starting a blog of their own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much leverage in the things that exist outside of this blog, outside of the blogosphere, outside of the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many impact points exist beyond our interactions here, ways to get involved, ways to speak out, ways to demonstrate?  In passing out autistic-positive flyers at events that would disparage us, in being visible, in demanding to be regarded?  In attending town hall meetings, in getting involved in local policy making, in not letting policy makers get away with ignoring us, autistic people, in policy decisions about us, that directly affect us?  In getting involved in research that is good for us rather than bad for us, in working with cross-disability self-advocacy groups and building on the ground work that came before us, in thinking critically about what comes through the media?  In simply standing up to an abuser and refusing to take it, in any way, even just once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many leverage points are there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social systems are huge and slow, they have a lot of inertia, and take a long time to change.  But if we find the right leverage points and push, what can we accomplish?  How much have we accomplished already?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296366691847"><id gr:original-id="http://news.change.org/stories/camp_charlie">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e6205fb83c2b62c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Camp Charlie</title><published>2009-07-30T07:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-30T07:39:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/stories/camp_charlie" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.fantasyforest.fr/images/canoe-02.jpg" height="200" alt="Canoeing from http://www.fantasyforest.fr/images/canoe-02.jpg" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="200"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That's how Jim and I have been characterizing our summer. At first I saw Camp Charlie as a camp with one camper (Charlie) and two counselors (Jim and me), hurrying around in a somewhat harried manner. As July comes to an end, I've felt that it's become a camp with three campers on a full schedule of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Morning: Academic time (Charlie goes to Extended School Year (ESY), Jim and I sit in front of our respective computers and get as much done as we can).&lt;br&gt;
(2) Afternoon: Recreation (a long bike ride, sometimes a swim + gym time); quiet time (in which I try to sneak in typing practice and other "edutainment" between video-watching on the computer); out-in-the-community time (often visiting various stores); canoeing (Jim's latest addition to his and Charlie's roster of outdoor pursuits)&lt;br&gt;
(3) Evening activities: Shorter bike ride and/or basketball&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in June, I was anticipating that this was going to be a tough summer. Charlie's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_time_of_perpetual_transitions_adolescence"&gt;school year&lt;/a&gt; ended with a stack of incident reports. He'd already been having a difficult and difficult-er time as the school year progressed and Jim and I were called into a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime_iep_time"&gt;district-requested IEP meeting&lt;/a&gt; in June. That meeting was cancelled by the district and rescheduled for July at which time we found ourselves &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/back_on_the_road_to_find_a_school"&gt;back on the road to find Charlie a school&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been making the rounds visiting schools, reviewing Charlie's records in the school district offices, setting up appointments, having Charlie observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you have been on this road before and your support suggestions have been more than welcomed. Just knowing you're all out there has made a tremendous difference: I'm heartened not only when I read your comments here. When we're at the table talking to the school district and the tape recorder is running, it means a great deal to know that you're not alone, that your child is one among many children for whom our educational system is not working. And that means, we need to change the system, change what is going on in the classroom and in the schools, and figure out how to create an appropriate education and accommodations for students with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As many people have pointed out to me, I should watch what I'm writing here about my son's school situation; school districts, consultants hired by the school districts, and others can of course read this. So I'll leave it at that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to Camp Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; After making his way through some rough waters at the end of the school year, Charlie has been well. May and June were made further interesting due to his neurologist changing his medication. Charlie has been taking &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/no-magic-pill-for-autism-on-risperdal-and-the-importance-of-autism-education/"&gt;Risperdal&lt;/a&gt; for the past four years, since he was eight years old. Throughout June, we slowly weaned him off it and started some new medications. I have been feeling quite dubious at how well any of these medications might be helping Charlie after seeing him have so much trouble while on Risperdal. But, so far, the meds seem to helping him and he simply seems much more peaceful easy-feeling, as Jim likes to put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note: Charlie's Risperdal dosage has of course increased as he has grown. When he first started the medicine, he had a significant increase in his appetite and put on the pounds. People often throw up their hands and say "what can you, it's a side effect"; we did our best to provide Charlie with healthy choices (argh, I sound like a nutritionist!) and kept him active. Over time, the increase in appetite seemed to wane, but it would come back as the dosages increased and by this past spring, I often found Charlie looking down at his expanding middle, very perplexed at what was going on. With the change in meds, his appetite has leveled off, though it's still quite in abundance (he did just &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/size_matters"&gt;grow another inch&lt;/a&gt; and has been wearing a pair of Jim's size 10 1/2 shoes). I can't say for sure, but being more in a fit and fighting trim has made Charlie happier; certainly, he's gotten more agile than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of course may also have something to do with all that bike riding. Certainly the other members of Camp Charlie have been definitely getting into shape this summer!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296365750434"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10e646e5c5d44de7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Resign of the Times</title><published>2011-01-30T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-30T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/humor/letters/zantex.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did an employee of Zantex Computers pen a scathing resignation letter?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296364064910"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/technobabble_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/756d01cf186e05e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Technobabble</title><published>2011-01-30T04:53:37Z</published><updated>2011-01-30T04:53:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/VqqyiA2JL3s/technobabble_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/technobabble_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do not visit web sites if your computer is running Windows.  &lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/microsoft-warns-mhtml-bug-windows-012811"&gt;Recent reports&lt;/a&gt; indicate that your computer could be taken over by malicious forces. &lt;/p&gt;

There are several reasons for this.  For one thing, I get the jokes.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  Some of them are rather subtle and require an understanding of church dogma.  Also, I can relate to the stranger side of the belief system from personal experience.  When the book The Exorcist came out, everyone in my family read it, we all discussed it, and we considered the question: "Is it true or not?"  And we decided that it was true.  It probably helped that my cousin was a trained Exorcist, though I don't believe he ever actually exorcised anyone.  It is said, though, that he witnessed ... strange things ... when in Rome learning the craft.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/does_the_rite_have_the_right_s.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/does_the_rite_have_the_right_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/HH0mrtnSU4Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296357175189"><id gr:original-id="http://www.aschoonerofscience.com/?p=1983">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/34df181398ed750d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Radioactive decay of teaspoons in the workplace</title><published>2011-01-29T20:44:13Z</published><updated>2011-01-29T20:44:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/ZANxhmzKgRo/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.aschoonerofscience.com/?p=1983"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Have you ever noticed a mysterious loss of teaspoons at your workplace?

He's here as a guest of our philosophy department, though, because his latest movie is &lt;a href="http://thenatureofexistence.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Nature of Existence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which he asks various people about the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Wandering around the world asking strange weirdos to explain why the world was created  sounds like a lousy way to do philosophy, and an even worse way to do science, but it might be a great way to do entertainment. We'll have to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's going to be doing a &lt;a href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/academic/philosophy/Philosophy/film%20marathon.htm"&gt;marathon screening of the companion series&lt;/a&gt; to the film from noon to 9pm on Sunday (tomorrow!) 30 January, in Imholte 109. This event is free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! There's more! And all totally free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, 31 January, you can meet with Roger Nygard from 3:30-4:30 in the McGinnis Room of the university library. And then at 7pm, in Imholte 109, there will be a screening of the movie &lt;i&gt;The Nature of Existence&lt;/i&gt;…again, open to the public. This event is sponsored by the Midwest Philosophy Colloquium, the International Programs Committee, and the Morris Freethinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be dropping in on some of the events, depending on whether I can get all caught up in my lecture prep for the coming week (with my current load, I will die if I don't have most of the work laid out on the weekend); I've also got to get some preliminary work done organizing some talks for the week after, which contains Darwin Day, in case you'd forgotten. I will peel myself away for at least a little while, though, to be entertained but probably not enlightened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/roger_nygard_in_morris.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tI7WzMhvjC8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296342130815"><id gr:original-id="http://helikonios.wordpress.com/2011/01/29/what-if-anything-is-a-beaver/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8403c4fa8480fabf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">What, if anything, is a beaver?</title><published>2011-01-29T16:03:21Z</published><updated>2011-01-29T16:03:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/BFwk0I4sJJI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://helikonios.wordpress.com/2011/01/29/what-if-anything-is-a-beaver/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The title of this post is a reference to this paper (only the first page is available for free, but only the first two paragraphs are relevent) and to a Stephen Jay Gould essay.

The short version: &lt;i&gt;they ruin everything they fucking touch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, normally Feargus saying he wants to do a sequel to Chrono Trigger would just be meaningless fapping, except Obsidian is developing a sequel to Dungeon Siege for Square-Enix, who recently acquired the property from Microsoft. That means that there is actually a chance, however small, that Obsidian might actually get to develop a sequel to Chrono Trigger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, my friends, would be an unmitigated tragedy. Chrono Trigger is one of the finest games ever made and has been one of my favorites for almost fifteen years now. If Feargus gets his grubby little hands on the property and releases an unfinished, buggy, broken sequel Obsidian will be shitting all over an unmitigated classic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please, Square-Enix, please don't let Obsidian have Chrono Trigger. They've done enough damage already.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least it'll be hard for them to make Dungeon Siege any worse than it already is.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-6989817407818500459?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296334631741"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=18739">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92bed60244863241</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Lying mofo liars and the lovers that love them</title><published>2011-01-29T20:08:05Z</published><updated>2011-01-29T20:08:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2011/01/ai-lying-mofo-liars-and-the-lovers-that-love-them/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=057c5d845b2bf591cf4766bdf1b8bb5a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend I’m in LA with a handful of skeptical friends celebrating Surly Amy’s birthday. It’s been fun… and exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part was that she didn’t know any of us were coming. The look on her face when we arrived was epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning a huge surprise like this takes work… and a whole lot of lying. The thing is, I hate lies. I hate lying and I hate liars. My family does not to Santa because I’m too uncomfortable with the lying part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then there’s the lying-to-surprise lying. And I’m not sure why, but surprise-lying is totally cool with me. It kind of bothers me that it’s so cool with me.  I have a hard time explaining why lying to my friend for a month and the elaborate hoax that went into planning this whole event is okay… but lying about Santa is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about lying? When is it okay to lie? When is it not okay to lie? And isn’t Surly Amy the BEST BEST BEST? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 3pm ET.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was using Man's Reason on which to base my beliefs that the universe is old.  I wasn't going to the "true source" of all knowledge to get the straight dope on Creation.

I came across the best &lt;a href="http://dd.dynamicdiagrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/orrery_2006.swf"&gt;Flash Solar System app&lt;/a&gt; I've ever seen over at &lt;a href="http://dd.dynamicdiagrams.com/"&gt;dynamicdiagrams.com&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/solarsystem1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/solarsystem1-thumb-500x474-60790.jpg" width="500" height="474" alt="solarsystem1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Screenshots all mine, taken from &lt;a href="http://dd.dynamicdiagrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/orrery_2006.swf"&gt;playing with the app&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can run it forwards or backwards, show or hide the phases of the Moon, or -- as a neat trick -- switch to a Tychonian, or Earth-centered, view of our Solar System, which allows you to trace out the apparent paths of the planets as seen from Earth!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/tychosolarsystem.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/tychosolarsystem-thumb-500x484-60792.jpg" width="500" height="484" alt="tychosolarsystem.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, Mars' retrograde motion!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another neat thing?  I thought it would be fun to look for planetary alignments.  After all, people have been claiming that all sorts of bizarre things will happen on December 21st, 2012.  Let's just skip to that date!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/doomsday2012.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/doomsday2012-thumb-500x495-60794.jpg" width="500" height="495" alt="doomsday2012.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as you can see, it's just another day in the life of our Solar System.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I couldn't just say "the planets don't align" and be satisfied.  I &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to go and play around until I found a time where an unusual number of the planets actually &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; align.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/aug24_2507.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/aug24_2507-thumb-500x502-60796.jpg" width="500" height="502" alt="aug24_2507.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is: August 24th, 2507!  The full Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all appear within just a couple of degrees of one another in the night sky.  If I had gotten Saturn in there as well, that would have been the best alignment possible!  (Because you can never have Venus or Mercury align with the full Moon.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one was even worth switching to a Tychonian view.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/aug24_2507T.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the/aug24_2507T-thumb-500x478-60798.jpg" width="500" height="478" alt="aug24_2507T.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can any of you find out how far ahead you'd have to go to get all the outer planets, including Saturn, to line up with the full Moon?  Can any of you find a better alignment of more planets than this, perhaps even occurring within our lifetimes?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, whether you have fun playing around with &lt;a href="http://dd.dynamicdiagrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/orrery_2006.swf"&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; or not, hope you have a spectacular weekend! &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/weekend_diversion_watching_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296328343460"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=216432">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8157c6426fe6479</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><title type="html">With the dreaded V-Day fast approaching, Blisstree wants to</title><published>2011-01-29T18:30:57Z</published><updated>2011-01-29T18:30:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/216432/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the dreaded V-Day fast approaching, Blisstree wants to help you get your sexy on – in the form of a $150 gift certificate from Nautica.&lt;/strong&gt; One lucky fan of &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/blisstree"&gt;Blisstree on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; will win up to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/become-our-facebook-fan-enter-to-win-150-in-nautica-gear-for-you-and-your-valentine/"&gt;$150 worth of swag from Nautica’s online shop&lt;/a&gt;, which we’ll ship to you before Valentine’s Day.

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to blogging, meanwhile, no less than 16 posts (!) were put up on this blog during the afternoon of the NSF&lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=118266&amp;amp;org=NSF"&gt; “Science: Becoming the Messenger&lt;/a&gt;” workshop. There was a contest/competition to determine which of them would be the most popular, judging by blog traffic, comments, and other parameters, and at this point, it’s still unclear which post will be the winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 16 total posts, it was a very crowded field, and none benefitted much by being at the top of the page because they were pushed down by other contenders within minutes of appearing. In this context, using social media to draw attention to one’s post was critical–and sure enough, the leading posts all succeeded in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/27/a-geek-is-a-terrible-thing-to-waste/"&gt;A Geek is a Terrible Thing To Waste&lt;/a&gt;,” by Jill Hummels, is currently leading with 8 comments and 393 pageviews. Much of the post’s traffic seems to have come from Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a number of other contenders that are close in traffic:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/27/the-past-is-the-key-to-the-present-and-the-savior-of-the-future/"&gt;The past is key to the present and savior of the future&lt;/a&gt;,” by Corinne Myers &amp;amp; Erin Saupe, is currently in second place for traffic. This is largely due to good showings on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/27/will-you-miss-the-trees-when-they-are-gone/"&gt;Will you miss the trees when they are gone&lt;/a&gt;,” whose author is not actually listed (oops) is currently in third place. It has been very successful on StumbleUpon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/27/fish-food-for-thought/"&gt;Fish Food for Thought&lt;/a&gt;,” by Hannah Owens, has probably my favorite title and is fourth in traffic so far, thanks to a good showing on Reddit.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I don’t want to call a winner yet because the contenders are too close and one could still trend in a new direction. I want to let things settle out a bit more. But already, a key lesson I was trying to teach in the workshop has been borne out: Blogging is great, but you must also master social media tools to increase the number of eyeballs to your blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;

A few examples are below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://jewmanist.com/2011/01/25/christopher-hitchens-surrender-to-reason/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://jewmanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ChrisHitchens-Surrender-of-Reason.jpg" width="550" height="550"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Faith is the surrender of the mind; it’s the surrender of reason, it’s the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other mammals. It’s our need to believe, and to surrender our skepticism and our reason, our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something, that is the sinister thing to me. Of all the supposed virtues, faith must be the most overrated. — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://jewmanist.com/2011/01/25/christopher-hitchens-surrender-to-reason/"&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In fact, ”atheism” is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a “non-astrologer” or a “non-alchemist.” We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs. — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://jewmanist.com/2011/01/27/sam-harris-the-word-atheism/"&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there’s little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides. — &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://jewmanist.com/2011/01/27/carl-sagan-exquisite-world/"&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

You may have also heard about another recent publication of a study conducted by 8-10 year olds.

&amp;quot;How are these studies related?&amp;quot; You may ask.

&amp;quot;They are not.&amp;quot; I may respond. Actually I will respond. These studies have nothing to do with each other. However, they are related from the perspective that they are BIG news!

In the first case MPR was all over it this morning. Here is the audio of the program:

/**/

Kerri Miller had a psychiatrist on to discuss this paper and she did an excellent job IMO in noting the post hoc ergo propter hoc argument that would be immediately made. Dr. Richard Gallagher

/**/

noted this issue but then ignored it. The take home message of this study is that teenagers who played video games a ton of time were more likely to have symptoms associated with depression a couple of years later. So what does this mean?

First, let&amp;#39;s back up and ask whether there is reason to think this study means nothing. This study was conducted in Singapore and the children in the study were primarily from China, Malaysia, and India. Does this matter? YES! The are significant cultural differences between these students and US students, to whom these study results will be applied (This study wasn&amp;#39;t on MPR to highlight issues specific to students in Asia).

Just because a study primarily uses students from another culture does not discredit said study, but it is an important factor to consider. A study on American children may not be applicable to France, but that does not mean it should be ignored, it simply means we need to &amp;#39;critical think&amp;#39; about the data (as we always should).

Alright back to the Pediatrics study at hand. The conclusion that will be the headline in newspapers, &amp;quot;Video game playing leads to teenage depression,&amp;quot; is it valid? Kerri Miller basically pointed out that correlation does not equal causation. I agree with her. Dr. Gallagher reiterated these points, but immediately back pedaled every time as far as I heard. He noted that isolation may lead to depression (or be a symptom of depression), which explains why playing a lot of video games is bad. I called in, but didn&amp;#39;t get on air, with the question if &amp;#39;isolation&amp;#39; is the problem, then what is the depression incidence in kids that watch 30+ hours of TV or read for 30+ hours (30+ hours of video game playing/week was the linked criteria in the study). If Dr. Gallagher&amp;#39;s hypothesis is correct, then any activity that results in social isolation should promote depression. (Caveats: the authors of the study did not differentiate social video game playing from asocial video game playing AND depression symptoms were identified but this was by self-assessment and no clinical criteria for depression was used nor associated with playing video games.) 

Before the whines come in, I am NOT saying playing video games for 4-5 hours daily is a good or neutral thing for middle/high school students or anyone else). But maybe kids disposed to depression will find any venue of escape, video games being the current modus operandi. In the 1970s it was TV, in the 1950s it was books, etc.

My concern is that we, as a society, will use this or similar studies to ignore real issues affecting the metal well-being of our children. BTW, don&amp;#39;t let your children play video games 4-5 hours/day every day. I mean REALLY!?!?!

Now to offset this study, I present the children of Blackawton Primary School in England. These kids just published a paper in the journal Biology Letters. This is a research paper in which the research was conducted by a group of 8-10 year old students (2-4th graders in US terms). Before I discuss anything about the paper, you should READ THE FUCKING THING!!! Dr. Lotto worked with some elementary school students, had the devise a previously untested hypothesis and test it. The kids learned something NEW!!! Something I didn&amp;#39;t know about the universe, and something you certainly didn&amp;#39;t know either. Read their fucking paper!!! This is science at its unadulterated best. The kids were not twisting science to try and get funding from some institution with an agenda. They were doing science like many of us started out &amp;#39;doing&amp;#39; science, because it was fucking AWESOME!!!!

I love the idea of playing, and science as being playing &amp;#39;with rules.&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Wait!&amp;quot; You say, &amp;quot;Rules are constricting, and how could a constricting environment lead to new information?&amp;quot;

Great question! I would argue that the &amp;#39;rules&amp;#39; of science are not constricting. Nay, the &amp;#39;rules&amp;#39; of science are part and parcel with the &amp;#39;critical thinking&amp;#39; issues I was discussing in the previous post. These kids nail it. Regardless of whether you agree with me or not, READ THIS PAPER!!!11!!11 It was written primarily by 8-10 year olds, now 10-12 year olds. You do not have to smarter than a fifth grader to read this paper, although you do need to be smarter than a teabagger. A couple of great points about this paper. There are no references!!! The students came up with these ideas on their own independent of some deep framework. So who would you reference? The group that reported bees were alive? The figures are in crayon! Of ~1/3 of the seminars I see, the presenters could benefit from graphic design tips from these kids. Finally, with an N = 1, I find that kids do not conflate &amp;#39;is&amp;#39; with &amp;#39;ought&amp;#39;. The kids say it best themselves (from the last paragraph of their paper!),

&amp;quot;Before doing these experiments we did not really think a lot about bees and how they are as smart as us. We also did not think about the fact that without bees we would not survive, because bees keep the flowers going. So it is important to understand bees. We discovered how fun it was to train bees. This is also cool because you do not get to train bees everyday. We like bees. Science is cool and fun because you get to do stuff that no one has ever done before. (Bees—seem to—think!)&amp;quot; (emphasis mine)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

How nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican announced a new initiative aimed at promoting dialogue between theists and atheists to be launched with a two-day event this March in Paris.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Vatican's Pontifical Council for Culture will sponsor a series of seminars on the theme of "Religion, Light and Common Reason," at various locations in the city, including Paris-Sorbonne University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is that I don't know of any atheists who've been invited, nor has the Vatican made any mention of who will be there. So who is this for? Are they going to actually bring in some of the argumentative atheists who have deep differences with religion, or will they just stock the place with atheist-butteries and nice atheists who love the church?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what will they do there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events will conclude with a party for youth in the courtyard of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, followed by prayer and meditation inside the cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, right. Two days in &lt;i&gt;Paris&lt;/i&gt; and we're going to hang out in a medieval church and pray. If they want to have a dialogue, they should split the events between religious la-de-da, organized by the Catholics, and secular indulgences in the fleshpots of the city, organized by local atheists. Then we'll see which worldview wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn't about learning anything about how us atheists think. It's about &lt;i&gt;converting&lt;/i&gt; us, and is fundamentally inimical to atheism. It's definitely not about "promoting dialogue".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pope has made turning back the tide of Western secularism one of the major campaigns of his papacy. The Vatican last year established the Pontifical Council for the New Evangelization to focus especially on promoting Christianity in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck with turning back secularism by burying yourselves in an old stone relic and mumbling at Jesus, fellas!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/someone_explain_this_to_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jewPoDdK5PA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296315974637"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/ask_me_a_question_about_human.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf17efcdaacdac0e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Ask Me a Question about Human Universals and Get Your Fill of Kissing</title><published>2011-01-29T15:52:22Z</published><updated>2011-01-29T15:52:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/TN-d45xjXIg/ask_me_a_question_about_human.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/ask_me_a_question_about_human.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;These two things are only indirectly connected:&lt;br&gt;

What this all means:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday the 4th, Skeptically Speaking will have a pre-recorded interview with Sheril.  On that same show, I'll do a pre-recored installment of "Everything...".  You can go to the &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.ca/episodes/97-the-science-of-kissing"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; and click on "ask a question", but do it before Noon EST on Tuesday.  If there are too many questions, I'll address some of them in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Sheril's spot has already been recorded.  But if you have a question for her just ask me and I'll answer it in falsetto.

Boy, was I wrong. The two threads were neck-and-neck in commenting frequency through most of their lifespans, until last night when the LOVE thread petered out while the HATE thread got all fired up. Final scores: HATE, 702 comments; LOVE, 434 comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just goes to show that if love and hate go to war, hate will kick love's butt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still, we need to bring everyone back together, because I'm not going to maintain two everlasting threads all the time. Group hug, everyone! Lovers and haters all together now! We need 'em both, lovers to bring the lube and haters to bring the spice.&lt;/p&gt;

Actually, it’s an unusual picture of an unusual galaxy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out NGC 6503:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/static/archives/images/large/potw1032a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/11/hst_ngc6503.jpg" alt="hst_ngc6503" width="610" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture is brought to you by the good folks of &lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1032a/"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. Click it to get the galactinated 4000 x 2200 pixel version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture is wee bit odd because it combines images from two different filters not generally seen together. One is a near infrared filter just outside the range of the human eye (0.814 microns, if you’re keeping a log of all this) and shows mostly stars, colored blue in the picture. The pink/red is coming from a filter that isolates the light from hydrogen gas, and shows where stars are actively forming in giant nebulae. These factories are like our own &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/19/a-new-old-view-of-an-old-friend/"&gt;Orion Nebula&lt;/a&gt;, cranking out stars.&lt;br&gt;

I tried it last night, and it gave me an assortment of very bad vehicles: for example, a lot of them were just polygonal lumps that fell flat and sat there, while some had an odd wheel here and there, but also pointy bits that acted as brakes, or wheels that pointed upward at the sky and did nothing at all.

Part of the conflict is over the teaching of evolution in American public schools. Religious parents don't want their children exposed to ungodly evolution and the most vocal of them want creationism taught as part of the science curriculum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now you might think that that this particular battle has been decisively won by the "good guys" because of all the court victories. Not so. The results in the classroom reveal that evolution is not being taught except in the most liberal states and a substantial number of teachers are teaching creationism in spite of the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can read postings on &lt;i&gt;The Panda's Thumb&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/01/who-controls-am.html"&gt;Who controls America’s schools?

Each of these authors has their own take on the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to raise another question. What good has it done to win all the court cases? Has it prevented an even worse disaster? Has relying on lawyers to defend evolution been the right strategy or should more emphasis have been placed on promoting good science instead of the American Constitution?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&amp;#39;s one point that few people raise. Evolution is taught badly even in universities—and so is everything else. You might think that by the time a student graduates with a degree from university he or she will be knowledgeable enough to reject superstition and rely on critical thinking. If we can&amp;#39;t even do a good job of teaching adults in university then how can we expect public school teachers to do any better? In an ideal world every parent who is a university graduate should be an ally of their child&amp;#39;s teacher when it comes to supporting good science education.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-8848323372832925183?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296310017371"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8518845448899990994">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90ee0304d3c8e5d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">At What Point Would YOU Walk Out On An Ice Covered Lake?</title><published>2011-01-29T14:03:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-29T14:16:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/NnEe5epeSj0/at-what-point-would-you-walk-out-on-ice.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8518845448899990994/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8518845448899990994" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2011/01/at-what-point-would-you-walk-out-on-ice.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;I'm amazed when Christians argue their faith is more probably true than not, and then try to live as if they're 100% certain of it.

It’s nearly an hour long, but if you have the time it’s worth watching a brave, thoughtful, and articulate man facing death.  The interview is largely about Hitchens’s cancer, his treatment, and his attitude toward mortality. There is very little about politics.  I’ll let some of our cancer experts comment on the treatment that Hitchens describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitch’s hair has partially grown back, but he’s a bit hoarse here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/29/new-interview-with-christopher-hitchens/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/GeuLDRwfOhs/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have time to watch, you can read the written transcript of the interview &lt;a href="http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1322"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll highlight just one quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s a certain ghoulish element, even about the nice people who’ve been praying for me. Because they are not just praying for my recovery, they’re praying for my reconciliation with religion. And I—I proposed a tradeoff the other day, I said, I tell you what, what if we secularists stop going to hospitals and walking around the wards and asking if people are religious when they are in extremis and in their last days and saying look, you’ve still got a little time, why don’t you live the last few days of it as a free person. You’ll feel much better. All that nonsense they taught you. You know you could still have every chance to give it up. Experience the life of a free thinking autonomous person. Don’t live in fear, don’t believe in mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They – I don’t think they’d welcome it. And of course, we don’t do that. But it seems to be considered the right of almost everybody to do it the other way around. I don’t resent it at all, because I like every opportunity for the argument, but it—a lot of it has been to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boil it with &lt;strong&gt;onion&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;carrot&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;garlic clove&lt;/strong&gt;, all split, and &lt;strong&gt;bay leaf&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;salt&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pan #2, melt a few tablespoons of &lt;strong&gt;butter&lt;/strong&gt; and whisk 0.4 dl of &lt;strong&gt;wheat flour&lt;/strong&gt; into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 5 dl of the chicken broth from pan #1, strained, a little at a time, while whisking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the shredded zest of a &lt;strong&gt;lemon&lt;/strong&gt; and half of its juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add salt and &lt;strong&gt;pepper&lt;/strong&gt; to taste and a dash of &lt;strong&gt;turmeric&lt;/strong&gt; for colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the sauce has boiled for a while and thickened well, take it off the heat and whisk an &lt;strong&gt;egg&lt;/strong&gt; yolk into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, cook &lt;strong&gt;rice&lt;/strong&gt; and some &lt;strong&gt;vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to keep the chicken warm while you get everything ready is to leave it in the surplus broth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARNING: &lt;strong&gt;do not add milk or cream&lt;/strong&gt; to the sauce, as the citric acid will cause them to curdle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . the cat known as the mayor of Sharon, or Freddy,  lives at the Village  Hall, greeting folks who come to pay water or  property tax bills. He  meows to go out twice a day to make his rounds  in the small downtown,  visiting the post office, the back doors of  restaurants and at least one  tavern, as well as stopping to catch mice  in a wooded area across from  the Village Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not averse to a little recreational drug use, which turns him into the Charlie Sheen of cats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though he has the Village Hall to himself on  weekends and  evenings, he’s only gotten into trouble once – when  someone accidentally  left some catnip on a desk. When Kunkel and  Redenius came in the  following day, they found papers strewed about on  the desk and the  catnip scattered. Other than that, he leaves  everything alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a great personality and boatloads of charm, apparently the mayor has an acute sense of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really  funny. We’ll let him out in the afternoon and we’ll say  ‘Freddy, you  need to be back by 4:15 when we’re closing,’ ” said  Redenius. “And he  usually is. If he isn’t, he’s usually somewhere else  and we have to  start calling and knocking on doors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of hizzonor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/29/caturday-felids-official-kittehs/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/kC2_HLXjiSA/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from across the Pacific comes another kitteh official: Tama.  &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/27/japan"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this female calico (all calicos are female, of course, and if you don’t know why, read about it &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)  is official stationmaster of the Kishi station in Japan.  The station  was underused until they appointed Tama stationmaster (and equipped her  with a tiny hat); traffic then rose sharply.  Hundreds of tourists visit  Kishi to see Tama, who’s famous in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Tama wearing her official uniform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27481" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/caturday-felids-kitteh-officials/tama-cat-train-station-japa/"&gt;&lt;img title="tama-cat-train-station-japa" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tama-cat-train-station-japa.jpg?w=401&amp;amp;h=276" alt="" width="401" height="276"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Japanese correspondent &lt;a href="http://yokohamayomama.blogspot.com/"&gt;Yokohamamama&lt;/a&gt; reports that Tama’s tag says  “Station Master TAMA, and, in smaller letters at the bottom, Kishi Eki  (Kishi Station).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the LOLzy &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tama_%28cat%29"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, Tama doesn’t work alone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her staff consisted of two feline assistant stationmasters, Chibi (ちび&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;, born May 12, 2000) and an orange tabby cat named Miiko (ミーコ&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;, October 3, 1998 – July 20, 2009). Now only Chibi remains. Tama appeared in a documentary about cats titled &lt;em&gt;La Voie du chat&lt;/em&gt; in French and &lt;em&gt;Katzenlektionen&lt;/em&gt; in German by Italian filmmaker Myriam Tonelotto, broadcast on European TV channel ARTE in April 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kishigawa Line announced that it was releasing a new “Tama Densha” (たま電車, &lt;em&gt;Tama railcar/train&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;) train that was customized with cartoon depictions of Tama. It began running in spring 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s a video. Sadly, it’s in Japanese, but you get the idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/29/caturday-felids-official-kittehs/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/yn1SL_oI168/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cats bring joy to nearly everyone, and dull the pain of life.  This cartoon shows why they should be allowed to enter another profession: MEDICINE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . the cat known as the mayor of Sharon, or Freddy, lives at the Village  Hall, greeting folks who come to pay water or property tax bills. He  meows to go out twice a day to make his rounds in the small downtown,  visiting the post office, the back doors of restaurants and at least one  tavern, as well as stopping to catch mice in a wooded area across from  the Village Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s not averse to a little recreational drug use, either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though he has the Village Hall to himself on weekends and  evenings, he’s only gotten into trouble once – when someone accidentally  left some catnip on a desk. When Kunkel and Redenius came in the  following day, they found papers strewed about on the desk and the  catnip scattered. Other than that, he leaves everything alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from a great personality and boatloads of charm, apparently the mayor has an acute sense of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really  funny. We’ll let him out in the afternoon and we’ll say ‘Freddy, you  need to be back by 4:15 when we’re closing,’ ” said Redenius. “And he  usually is. If he isn’t, he’s usually somewhere else and we have to  start calling and knocking on doors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of hizzonor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from across the Pacific comes another kitteh official: Tama.  &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/27/japan"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this female calico (calicos are all female, of course, and if you don’t know why, read about it &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is official stationmaster of the Kishi station in Japan.  The station was underused until they appointed Tama stationmaster (and equipped her with a tiny hat); traffic then rose sharply.  Hundreds of tourists visit Kishi to see this Tama, who’s widely known in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Tama wearing her official uniform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27481" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/caturday-felids-kitteh-officials/tama-cat-train-station-japa/"&gt;&lt;img title="tama-cat-train-station-japa" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tama-cat-train-station-japa.jpg?w=490&amp;amp;h=338" alt="" width="490" height="338"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Japanese correspondent Yokohamamama reports that her tag says “Station Master TAMA, and, in smaller letters at the bottom, Kishi Eki (Kishi Station).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the LOLzy &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tama_%28cat%29"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, Tama doesn’t work alone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her staff consisted of two feline assistant stationmasters, Chibi (ちび&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;, born May 12, 2000) and an orange tabby cat named Miiko (ミーコ&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;, October 3, 1998 – July 20, 2009). Now only Chibi remains. Tama appeared in a documentary about cats titled &lt;em&gt;La Voie du chat&lt;/em&gt; in French and &lt;em&gt;Katzenlektionen&lt;/em&gt; in German by Italian filmmaker Myriam Tonelotto, broadcast on European TV channel ARTE in April 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s a video. Sadly, it’s in Japanese, but you get the idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/yn1SL_oI168?version%3D3%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0%26showinfo%3D1%26iv_load_policy%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=390" width="480" height="390"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kishigawa Line announced that it was releasing a new “Tama Densha” (たま電車, &lt;em&gt;Tama railcar/train&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;) train that was customized with cartoon depictions of Tama. It began running in spring 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this post, I write about a Beijing street name that began as a sinographically writable expression, but which — again in the mouths of those whose speech is not strongly conditioned by the characters — devolved into a form that cannot readily be written in characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with the book form of the name:  大柵欄.  The &amp;quot;proper,&amp;quot; Modern Standard Mandarin (MSM) pronunciation of this name should be Dà Zhàlán, which means &amp;quot;Big Paling(s) / Railing(s) / Bars.&amp;quot;  This is the name of one of the oldest commercial streets in Beijing, which lies in the Qianmen (&amp;quot;Front Gate&amp;quot;) district to the southwest of Tian&amp;#39;anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace — made especially famous by the events of June 4, 1989).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, probably about ten, I set out to find this street and its hutongs (alleys) about which I had heard so much.  Armed with a map, and already knowing my way around Beijing fairly well, I headed in the direction of Dà Zhàlán.  When I got near where I thought it should be, I began to ask the people on the street, "Qǐngwèn, Dà Zhàlán zài nǎr?" 請問，大柵欄在哪儿 ("Please tell me where Dà Zhàlán is").  Every single person looked at me uncomprehendingly, even though I very carefully and deliberately enunciated my question in the best  MSM I could muster.  After about 20 minutes of circling around in the area where I knew the street must be, I became more and more frustrated.  My failure to find Dà Zhàlán was particularly galling, inasmuch as I had prepared so thoroughly for finding it (bringing a map, reconnoitering the area, making sure I knew how to pronounce the characters with the proper tones, being careful to say nǎr 哪儿 ["where," with the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhua"&gt;Pekingese retroflex ending&lt;/a&gt;, instead of MSM nǎlǐ 哪裡], and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my wit&amp;#39;s end, and surmising from all of my focused wanderings through the hutongs that I must already have been on Dà Zhàlán street for some time, I decided to change my tactic.  So the next person I met, who looked like a real local who surely ought to know, I asked, &amp;quot;Qǐngwèn, zhè tiáo jiē jiào shénme míngzì?“ 請問，這條街叫甚麼名字? (&amp;quot;Please tell me the name of this street.&amp;quot;)  The answer I received almost made me keel over:  &amp;quot;Dashlar!&amp;quot;  Whereupon I mentioned that I was looking for Dà Zhàlán street — enunciating very carefully and with restrained exasperation, to which my interlocutor replied, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know where that street is, but this is Dashlar.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I saw a couple of Americans and went over to ask them where Dà Zhàlán street was, to which they replied, "You're on it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this happen?  How did Dà Zhàlán become Dashlar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem lies with the second syllable.  For some reason, the local Beijingers don&amp;#39;t want to be troubled to articulate zhà as is when it is sandwiched between dà and lán.  The phonological transformations of the name seem to have proceeded thus:  Dà Zhàlán –&amp;gt; Dà Shàlán –&amp;gt; Dàshílàn / Dàshilàn –&amp;gt; Dàshílànr / Dàshilànr –&amp;gt; Dashlar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the name as pronounced by a highly character-literate Beijinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person who spoke this would romanize it thus:  Dàshilànr.  But I can barely hear the [i] after the [ʃ], If it's there, it's present only as a somewhat elongated (140 msec.) [ʃ] segment, a tiny (15 msec.) voiceless [i] that is hardly distinguishable from the inevitable transition between [ʃ] and [l], and perhaps a pitch contour a bit different from what would unexpected in a true disyllable. This is same sort of process of high-vowel devoicing and assimilation to a preceding fricative which creates the typical Japanese pronunciation of e.g. "sukiyaki", where the first two syllables become [ski], with the only evidence of the /u/ vowel being an elongated [s] and a moral commitment to the lack of consonant clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a spectrogram of the above pronunciation of Dà Zhàlán, illustrating the point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/dashilar.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/dashilar.png" width="475" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm certain that I didn't hear even that ghost of the -i sound after the sh- when it was spoken to me on the street:  Dashlar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such phonological transformations are profuse in Pekingese speech, making it very difficult for outsiders to understand what the locals are saying.  The permutations of Gē&amp;#39;ermen 哥儿们 (&amp;quot;brothers, buddies, pals…&amp;quot;), for example, in increasingly less formal levels of speech, all the way down to gangster talk, are truly astonishing.  And that&amp;#39;s not even to broach the matter of unique lexical items in Pekingese, which are totally opaque to all but native speakers of the colloquial language (e.g., cuibenr [&amp;quot;toady, sycophant&amp;quot;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in all of the many varieties of Mandarin, the phonological expectations embodied in the writing system seem to have a much stronger effect on speech perception than on speech production. That is, native speakers produce all sorts of phonologically interesting forms which literate native listeners have a very hard time hearing. As a result, these phenomena have been much less widely documented and studied than might be expected, given how striking they are to learners.  The widespread lenition and even deletion of the medial consonant in two-syllable words is another example. Presumably the failure to hear such things is related to the well-known &lt;a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dwang/teaching/cse788/papers/Warren70.pdf"&gt;phoneme restoration effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The Secular Coalition for Alabama is needed now to increase the visibility of secular people, promote fact-based education to prepare our children for a complex world, protect the civil rights of all Alabamians and maintain the separation of church and state,” said Charles Miller, an IT services management executive in Huntsville is the founding president of the state chapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very excited to welcome the Secular Coalition for Alabama as our second state affiliate and a new means of amplifying the often forgotten voices of secular Alabamians in public debate,” said Sean Faircloth, executive director of the Secular Coalition for America. &lt;strong&gt;“It’s no secret that Alabama has often found itself in the national spotlight when dealing conflicts between church and state. We hope that this new organization will help advance the views of local nontheists on such issues, while also promoting and defending the secular values on which our nation was founded.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charter for &lt;a href="http://www.secularal.org/"&gt;the new group&lt;/a&gt; will be signed this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two states down, 48 to go… this is all proceeding much faster than I expected, and that’s &lt;a href="http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/01/non-theists_organize_secular_c.html"&gt;good news&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s also very exciting that these affiliates are being created in states where church/state separation is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the SCA will be able to handle a rapid growth because I’m sure more groups will be formed in the near future.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think that making iconoclastic comments about pretty much every Hollywood star in attendance might as well get people sniffy about his performance (as hilarious as some of them were) – but as I’ve learned, it’s the comparatively innocuous closing quip, “&lt;em&gt;Thank God I’m an atheist&lt;/em&gt;”, that got everyone outraged about Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes (which has &lt;a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Golden+Globes+maintains+offbeat+reputation/3979608/story.html"&gt;never really had&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8261374/Golden-Globe-awards-hit-by-corruption-scandal.html"&gt;prestigious reputation anyway&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award#Controversies"&gt;case you didn’t know&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here CNN’s Piers Morgan acts like a person who hasn’t done even the basic research on ‘what atheism is about’ and Gervais has to put up with it. Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there’s two episodes of the &lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;Token Skeptic podcast&lt;/a&gt; that have been re-released – complete with a lot of links to other shows and news – so check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

That will be on&lt;em&gt; ‘Little Sugar Pills – Why Fall for Homeopathy’?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and then I’ll catch up on some reading, writing and editing [probably by candlelight at this rate]. Take care of yourself if you’re in Perth or the regions near the storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blue.butler.edu/~mzimmerm/rel_evolution_weekend_2009.htm"&gt;The Clergy Letter Project &amp;amp; Evolution Weekend&lt;/a&gt; — Despite what a lot of creationists claim, there are a lot of people out there who both believe in God and accept the science of evolution.  These people are organizing into a series of events during the weekend closest to Darwin’s birthday, and many of the events involve speeches and sermons at religious houses of worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.darwinday.org/"&gt;The International Darwin Day Foundation&lt;/a&gt; — For those of a slightly more secular bent, events commemorating Darwin’s birthday and contributions to science  can also be found here.  In fact, the folks at the IDDF have put together a neat little video outlining why we should all celebrate Darwin Day…&lt;/p&gt;

Their answers are not entirely comforting.
  
The authors, who &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/404.full" rel="external "&gt; discussed some of their findings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; the other day, analyze a number of well-known polls and also their own poll of biology teachers, which they conducted in 2007. They conclude that a substantial majority of Americans want creationism taught in public schools – not necessarily creationism alone, but creationism nonetheless. They also note that the number of citizens who support evolution alone is increasing at the expense of those who want both taught but not, presumably, those who want creationism alone taught. A myriad of court decisions, however, has ruled out teaching of creationism in any form. The nation is divided, as they put it, by religion, education, and place. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors go on to examine standards in different states. They show that the quality of the standards is lower and the standards are often cursory in states where a majority is not favorable to teaching evolution. In contrast, the standards are most rigorous in states where the majority is favorable to evolution. Nothing especially surprising, but it is probably worthwhile to have such information documented rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do teachers actually teach? The authors estimate that 14-21 % of teachers unconstitutionally endorse creationism in the classroom, while others find ways to undermine the theory of evolution or avoid teaching it entirely. Their &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article estimates that 28 % teach evolution according to recognized standards, whereas the remaining ~60 % are cautious for various reasons, not least their own failure to understand evolution themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors portray teachers as &lt;em&gt;street-level bureaucrats&lt;/em&gt;, that is, people who interact with the public and actually implement policy, like police or social workers. Teachers thus may be more responsive to local “standards” than to state or national standards (yeah, those are scare quotes). Indeed, the authors show that teachers in more-liberal areas are more apt to teach evolution than those in conservative areas, more or less irrespective of the state standards. They attribute this result, at least in part, to selection of communities or school districts by teachers, and also selection of teachers by school administrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkman and Plutzer note that the evolution-creation war (their term) has been with us since the 1920’s, and they think it will be with us for a long time. It is the result of religious conservatism, the growth and perhaps the success of science, and the achievement of universal public education. It has been propagated, in part, because the debate has been politicized and divides more or less along political-party lines. Worse, the “system” of public education in the United States is highly decentralized, so local communities and local school boards often have more influence over what is taught than state or federal standards, or experts. If science is not taken as seriously as reading and mathematics, then state-wide science standards will not be enforced. Federal court decisions have perhaps prevented some of the worst abuses, but evolution deniers have always found ways to get around or ignore those decisions. Finally, it appears that general scientific knowledge (or lack thereof) does not correlate particularly strongly with creationism, and public opinion has been remarkably stable since polls first investigated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who then decides? The authors equivocate a little bit on the question of who should decide, but state clearly who in fact decides: teachers. Their solution to the problem, which is spelled out in somewhat more detail in the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article, is to go after the teachers: Require what they call &lt;em&gt;preservice teachers&lt;/em&gt; (people training to be teachers) to study at least one semester of evolutionary biology in college. They recognize how hard it will be to enforce such a policy and also how long it will take to have any practical effect in the classrooms. But they present evidence that state standards have greater influence on younger teachers than older, Possibly bacause the younger teachers were trained after the widespread adoption of standards, so getting at the problem through the teachers may be a viable solution, but I fear it is not fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a bit of anticlimactic boilerplate: I thought the book was well prepared and clearly written, but I did not especially like the gray background on all the tables, and I thought it would be good if the copyeditor learned the difference between principle and principal. Additionally, I looked up one or two items in the index and did not find them discussed by name on those pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also what I can only call a &lt;a href="http://www.cambridgeblog.org/2010/10/evolution-ive-heard-this-song-before/" rel="external "&gt;review by the authors of their own book&lt;/a&gt; on the Cambridge University Press website and an interesting &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/01/taking-the-creationismevolution-battle-to-training-teachers.ars" rel="external "&gt;interview with Plutzer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-five years ago today, I remember being a student in my second grade classroom.  It was a big day, because they were launching the first &lt;i&gt;schoolteacher&lt;/i&gt; into space, Christa McAuliffe, along with a crew of NASA astronauts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/challenger_crew_2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/challenger_crew_2-thumb-500x375-60769.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="challenger_crew_2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisions were wheeled into our classrooms so we could watch the launch live on television.  While these astronauts weren't going to the Moon (which was -- to my second grade mind -- the coolest thing any astronaut could ever do), they &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; getting to ride into outer space aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/060125_challenger_3shot_hmedhmedium.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/060125_challenger_3shot_hmedhmedium-thumb-500x314-60771.jpeg" width="500" height="314" alt="060125_challenger_3shot_hmedhmedium.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching ascending rocket closely, you could see that something might be wrong.  The main tank appeared to catch on fire, and the flames from the rockets beneath seemed to rise up the spacecraft.  But nobody was prepared for what happened next.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/image.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/image-thumb-500x415-60773.jpeg" width="500" height="415" alt="image.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we had no way of knowing at the time, the entire crew of seven -- Gregory Jarvis, &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/82931/christa-mcauliffe%E2%80%99s-legacy-goes-on/"&gt;Christa McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/28/133275198/astronauts-brother-recalls-a-man-who-dreamed-big"&gt;Ronald McNair&lt;/a&gt;, Ellison Onizuka, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/04/weekend_diversion_the_first_am.php"&gt;Judith Resnik&lt;/a&gt;, Francis Scobee, and Michael Smith -- most likely &lt;i&gt;weren't&lt;/i&gt; immediately killed by the explosion, but rather by either depressurization and freezing, or by impact with the sea below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like any tragedy, we had to deal with it.  How did we do?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/Return_to_Flight_Launch_of_Discovery_-_GPN-2000-001871.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/Return_to_Flight_Launch_of_Discovery_-_GPN-2000-001871-thumb-500x625-60775.jpeg" width="500" height="625" alt="Return_to_Flight_Launch_of_Discovery_-_GPN-2000-001871.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we found and fixed the flaws that caused the accident, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-26"&gt;and returned to space 32 months later&lt;/a&gt; with the Space Shuttle Discovery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we lost a lot more that day, 25 years ago, than the seven brave women and men aboard the Challenger.  As a nation, we lost our eagerness for human space exploration in a way that would have been unfathomable 20 years prior.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/360964_com_spaceguns5.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/360964_com_spaceguns5-thumb-500x375-60777.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="360964_com_spaceguns5.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a picture of &lt;a href="http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=54"&gt;Virgil 'Gus' Grissom&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Apollo 1 astronauts killed in a launch pad fire.  Perhaps prophetically, he knew that what he was taking part in was a risky endeavor.  And he said the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we die, we want people to accept it. We're in a risky business, and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life." -&lt;i&gt;Gus Grissom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/hst2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/hst2-thumb-500x441-60779.jpeg" width="500" height="441" alt="hst2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that it was better to devote NASA's resources towards science goals and away from spaceflight.  And the science we've gotten from it -- from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/the_camera_that_changed_the_u5.php"&gt;the Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/the_land_of_opportunity.php"&gt;Mars rovers&lt;/a&gt;, and a plethora of probes, spacecraft, and satellites -- has been one of the biggest windfalls of knowledge for all of humanity.  And I can't say anything bad about that decision; I'm thankful for each and every bit of knowledge we got for every one of our dollars.  (In fact, it's a good chunk of what I write about, here!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/P8080014-HumanOnMars.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/P8080014-HumanOnMars-thumb-500x375-60781.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="P8080014-HumanOnMars.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; have so many of us given up our dreams of traveling to, exploring, and eventually living on other worlds, or even other &lt;i&gt;star systems&lt;/i&gt;?  Perhaps the world is finally ready to take on what -- perhaps -- no one nation can finance itself: a &lt;i&gt;manned interplanetary journey&lt;/i&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/iss_sunrise.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/iss_sunrise-thumb-500x374-60783.jpeg" width="500" height="374" alt="iss_sunrise.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/iss_ovr/index.htm"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; isn't about doing objectively groundbreaking science.  It's about a human presence in space, and about all our nations' dreams of taking that next breathtaking step.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/superhighway.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger/superhighway-thumb-500x366-60785.jpeg" width="500" height="366" alt="superhighway.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.multires.caltech.edu/~cici/"&gt;Cici Koenig&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time to dream again, and to &lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt; reach for the stars.  In addition to (and separate from) NASA's &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; budget, how about we start work on human exploration once again?  (Hey Barack, seriously, &lt;b&gt;best use of stimulus funds &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!)  I know I would love to see it, and I know many of you would, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So today, I won't just be remembering the seven brave souls who tragically lost their lives, I'll remember the spirit with which they bravely stepped into that shuttle, putting their lives on the line to explore just a little bit farther into the abyss.  And I'll hope that this will prove to be, in fact, just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/25_years_after_challenger.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296266554678"><id gr:original-id="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/01/premature-brain-diagnosis-in-japan.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6df9333f7fa2b26e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Premature Brain Diagnosis in Japan?</title><published>2011-01-28T18:24:36Z</published><updated>2011-01-28T18:24:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/5seSCredWbQ/premature-brain-diagnosis-in-japan.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/01/premature-brain-diagnosis-in-japan.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Nature has a disturbing article from their Asian correspondent David Cyranoski: Thought experiment. It's open access.In brief: a number of top Japanese psychiatrists have started offering a neuroimaging method called NIRS to their patients as a diagnostic tool. They claim that NIRS shows the neural signatures of different mental illnesses.The technology was approved by the Japanese authorities in April 2009, and since then it's been used on at least 300 patients, who pay $160 for the privilege. However, it's not clear that it works.To put it mildly.*NIRS is Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy. It measures blood flow and oxygenation in the brain. In this respect, it's much like fMRI, but whereas fMRI uses superconducting magnets and quantum wizardry to achieve this, NIRS simply shines a near-infra-red light into the head, and records the light reflected backIt's a lot cheaper and easier than MRI. However, the images it provides are a lot less detailed, and it can only image the surface of the brain. NIRS has a small but growing number of users in neuroscience research; it's especially popular in Japan, for some reason, but it's also found plenty of users elsewhere.The clinical use of NIRS in psychiatry was pioneered by one Dr Masato Fukuda, and he's been responsible for most of the trials. So what are these trials?As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), these are all the trials comparing patients and controls that he's been an author on:Matsuo et al (2000) n=9/10 elderly depressed/controlsSuto et al (2004) n=10/13/16 depressed/schizophrenia/controlsKameyama et al (2006) n=17/11/17 bipolar/depression/controlsNishimura et al (2007) n=5/33 panic disorder/controlsTakizawa et al (2008) n=55/70 schizophrenia/controlsUehara et al (2007) n=11/11 eating disorder/controlsSuda et al (2010) n=27/27 eating disorder/controls   There are also a handful of Fukuda's papers in Japanese, which I can't read, but as far as I can tell they're general discussions rather than data papers.So we have 342 people in all. Actually, a bit less, because some of them were included in more than one study. That's still quite a lot - but there were only 5 panic patients, 30 depressed (including 9 elderly, who may be different), 38 eating disordered and just 17 bipolar in the mix.And the bipolar people were currently feeling fine, or just a little bit down, at the time of the NIRS. There are quite a lot of other trials from other Japanese groups, but sticking with bipolar disorder as an example, no trials that I could find examined people who were currently ill. The only other two trials, both very small, were in recovered people (1,2).Given that the whole point of diagnosis is to find out what any given patient has, when they're ill, this matters to every patient. Anyone could be psychotic, or depressed, or eating disordered, or any combination thereof.Worse yet, in many of these studies the patients were taking medications. In the 2006 depression/bipolar paper, for example, all of the bipolars were on heavy-duty mood stabilizers, mostly lithium; plus a few antipsychotics, and lots of antidepressants. The depressed people were on antidepressants.There's a deeper problem. Fukuda says that NIRS corresponds with the clinical diagnosis in 80% of cases. Let's assume that's true. Well, if the NIRS agrees with the clinical diagnosis, it doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know. If the NIRS disagrees, who do you trust?I think you'd have to trust the clinician, because the clinician is the "gold standard" against which the NIRS is compared. Psychiatric diseases are defined clinically. If you had to choose between 80% gold and pure gold, it's not a hard choice.Now NIRS could, in theory, be better than clinical diagnosis: it could provide more accurate prognosis, and more useful treatment recommendations. That would be cool. But as far as I can see there's absolutely no published evidence on that.To find out you'd have to compare patients diagnosed with NIRS to patients diagnosed normally - or better, to those randomized to get fake placebo NIRS, like the authors of this trial from last year should have done. To my knowledge, there have been no such tests at all.*So what? NIRS is harmless, quick, and $160 is not a lot. Patients like it: “They want some kind of hard evidence,” [Fukuda says], especially when they have to explain absences from work. If it helps people to come to terms with their illness - no mean feat in many cases - what's the problem?My worry is that it could mean misdiagnosing patients, and therefore mis-treating them. Here's the most disturbing bit of the article:...when Fukuda calculates his success rates, NIRS results that match the clinical diagnosis are considered a success. If the results don’t match, Fukuda says he will ask the patient and patient’s family “repeatedly” whether they might have missed something — for example, whether a depressed patient whose NIRS examination suggests schizophrenia might have forgotten to mention that he was experiencing hallucinations.Quite apart from the implication that the 80% success rate might be inflated, this suggests that some dubious clinical decisions might be going on. The first-line treatments for schizophrenia are quite different, and rather less pleasant, than those for depression. A lot of perfectly healthy people report "hallucinations" if you probe hard enough. "Seek, and ye shall find". So be careful what you seek for.While NIRS is a Japanese speciality, other brain-based diagnostic or "treatment personalization" tools are being tested elsewhere. In the USA, EEG has been proposed by a number of groups. I've been rather critical of these methods, but at least they've done some trials to establish whether this actually improves patient outcomes.In my view, all of these "diagnostic" or "predictive" tools should be subject to exactly the same tests as treatments are: double blind, randomized, sham-controlled trials....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Mark Boyd, president of the [&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Central-Valley-Alliance-of-Atheists-and-Skeptics/14947639438"&gt;Central Valley Alliance of Atheists and Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;], says that it is difficult to keep these campus organizations going because they lack continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The religious groups on campus have churches,” Boyd said. “A church can drop down a thousand dollars without blinking an eye for a pizza party or swim party, and get a lot of people involved very quickly. We’re looking to do something very similar.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is labeled at the center top (marked by purple arrows).New Scientist covered two journal articles by Rametti and colleagues (2010, 2011), a group of Spanish researchers and clinicians affiliated with Unidad Trastorno Identidad de Género [Gender Identity Disorder Unit]. Using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) method, they initially wanted to identify any sex differences in the white mater of the brains of non-transgendered male and female heterosexuals. Then the next step was a prediction that FTM (Female-to-Male) transsexuals would be more like males, while MTF (Male-to-Female) transsexuals would be more like females.Transsexual differences caught on brain scan12:16 26 January 2011 by Jessica HamzelouDifferences in the brain&amp;#39;s white matter that clash with a person&amp;#39;s genetic sex may hold the key to identifying transsexual people before puberty. Doctors could use this information to make a case for delaying puberty to improve the success of a sex change later.In 5 years of writing this blog, I have come across a multitude of news  stories and press releases that make outrageous claims. Here&amp;#39;s another  one to add to the list. On the basis of two highly variable DTI studies in 36 pre-operative, pre-hormone treatment transgender individuals, now we&amp;#39;re supposed to screen children for gender variant behavior and scan them at a young age, so their hormones can be altered before puberty?Returning to the structural imaging experiments, were there any hypotheses at the outset, or were these completely exploratory studies? The authors cite the work of Zhou et al. (1995) on postmortem staining of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). This subcortical nucleus connects the amygdala to the septal nuclei, hypothalamus, and thalamus. BST has been shown to play a role in the sexual behavior of male rats. The size of this nucleus in MTF brains was similar to that in female controls, both being smaller than male controls.However, it&amp;#39;s not possible to visualize the BST in living humans, so the authors went with DTI to look for cortical white matter changes. The participants in the first study were 18 FTM  transgendered persons (before undergoing hormonal treatment), along with  24 male and 19 female heterosexual controls. The major findings in terms of sex differences between groups were located mainly in 3 fiber tracts:anterior and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal  fasciculus - contains connections between the frontal, parietal, occipital, and  temporal lobes including language-related areas (Mori et al., 2008).forceps minor (anterior forceps) - fiber bundle connecting the lateral and medial surfaces of the frontal lobes, crossing the midline via the genu of the corpus callosum.corticospinal tract - connects the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord, contains mostly motor axons.In all 3 tracts, males showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) than females. FA is a measure of local tissue properties including density, coherence, diameter, and myelination.Fig. 1 (Rametti et al., 2010). Sex differences in  fractional anisotropy (FA). FA is lower in female than in male controls  in the superior longitudinal fasciculus with a posterior (A) and  anterior (B) predominance. Control females also show lower than control  male FA values in the forceps minor (C) and the corticospinal tract (D).  The group skeleton used for the between group contrast study is green.  The red color shows the clusters of significantly decreased FA in female  compared to male controls. The threshold for significance was set at p &amp;lt; 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons.FTM individuals showed greater FA values in all 3 tracts than did the control females. They were similar to control males for anterior and posterior SLF and forceps minor, and in between control male and female FA values for the corticospinal tract.What does this mean? Basically, at this point, it&amp;#39;s like reading tea leaves. We have no indication of other potential differences between the groups in cognitive, emotional, personality, or motor measures, in alcohol use, or in other psychiatric diagnoses. We do know that testosterone levels of the FTM participants were like those of control females, because they had yet to undergo hormone treatment.Moving right along to the second experiment, which compared MTF individuals to controls (Rametti et al., 2011)... The participants were 18 untreated MTF transsexuals (mean age = 25 yrs), 19 female (mean = 33 yrs) and 19 male controls (mean age = 32 yrs).  Yes, the MTF individuals were significantly younger than controls [the human frontal lobe in particular is known to continue maturation processes into the 20&amp;#39;s]. Procedures were similar to those used previously. Results in this study showed a greater number of differences in the white matter of male vs. female controls (again, with larger FA values for males): left and the right SLFforceps  minorright  inferior front-occipital fasciculus (IFOF)corticospinal tract left cingulumSo what&amp;#39;s new in this list? Left SLF, Right IFOF, Left cingulum. This finding indicates that individual differences were observed between two groups of male and female control subjects [or else there were unreported methodological differences].  If normal sex differences in DTI studies include IFOF and cingulum here but not there, that presents a problem for comparison to the transgendered populations.Nonetheless, what did that comparison show? The MTF individuals showed FA values between those of male and female controls for all tracts (except for IFOF, where they did not differ from males).Fig. 2 (Rametti et al., 2011). Histograms  showing the FA...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my many TV and radio interviews I proselytize the value of dreaming and dream recall because I know from my personal experience, and from a decade and a half of working with clients, that dream recall improves people’s lives. However, it is always exciting to me when a new study, much less one from Harvard, comes out to scientifically underscore what I’ve been evangelizing for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent Harvard study researchers determined that one of the many functions of dreams is to problem solve. In this study volunteers practiced moving through a difficult three-dimensional maze in their waking state. Because of the difficulty of the maze, all the participants in this study performed poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on the maze for a period of time, half the volunteers took a ninety-minute nap, while the other half stayed awake. Upon awakening, the participants who had a chance to sleep were asked to share their dreams. Half of the nappers recalled their dreams (all of which had something to do with a maze) while the half of the nappers reported not recalling any dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that recalled their dreams were then able to complete the maze in half the time as those who did not nap and of those who did not remember their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

Sony determines that having autism is "cheating"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Jennifer Zdenek, the mother of an 11-year-old boy who lives with autism, is outraged at Microsoft Xbox Live for labeling her son a "cheater" and taking away everything he's earned online.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says her son, Julias Jackson, is so good at playing X-Box games, Xbox LIVE thought he cheated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most news reporters understand that vaccines don’t cause autism. One hold out is CBS correspondent Sharyl Attkisson, &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-20029626-10391695.html"&gt;whose latest story &lt;/a&gt;attempts to link a pediatric flu vaccine to autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent vaccine safety update from the FDA notes an uptick in reports of febrile seizures following Fluzone, the only influenza virus vaccine licensed in the US for infants. Fluzone is a “split-virus” vaccine, produced by chemical disruption  of the influenza virus, and is incapable of causing influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Attkisson is having none of that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More confusing news for parents trying to do the best, safest things for their children when it comes to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Vaccine Safety “update” issued by the FDA on Jan. 20, there’s been an increase in reports of febrile seizures among infants and children following this year’s flu vaccine. Febrile seizures are seizures associated with fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the FDA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“FDA and CDC have recently  detected an increase in the number of reports to VAERS of febrile  seizures following vaccination with Fluzone (trivalent inactivated  influenza vaccine or TIV, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.). Fluzone  is the only influenza vaccine recommended for use for the 2010-2011 flu  season in infants and children 6-23 months of age. These reported  febrile seizures have primarily been seen in children younger than 2  years of age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA says 42 more seizures than usual  were reported through Dec. 13; most within a day of the child receiving  the flu vaccine. The FDA recommends parents take no action based on this  information. They should, the FDA says, continue getting their children  vaccinated against flu, as usual. (It should be noted that  non-government medical experts differ on the issue of whether flu shots  should be given to children.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA points out that  data from VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, is  preliminary and serves as a sign that further investigation is  warranted. The maker of the flu vaccine in question, Sanofi Pasteur, has  issued a statement saying that no clear link has been established  between the flu shot and the seizures, and the cases may be nothing more  than coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with “no clear link established,” the mere suggestion of a link may be troubling to parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s a biased, scientifically-challenged CBS reporter to do? &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-20029626-10391695.html"&gt;Create a link&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t exist, in order to scare parents even more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/Molecula.pdf"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from the department of Pediatrics and Neurology at the University of  Colorado Denver School of Medicine discusses how early life seizures  “may contribute to the enhanced risk of IDD’s (Intellectual and  Development Disabilities) and ASD’s (Autism Spectrum Disorders.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attkisson has either not read the study she cites, does not understand it, or has a very dark agenda. The paper discusses patients with early  life seizures and epilepsy. Attkisson gloms on to the findings and applies them, with no credible reason, to the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not the only major fail in this story. The 42 extra cases of febrile seizure reported in the VAERS database do not come close to establishing causality. Instead of telling readers the FDA report is no cause for alarm, Attkisson does the exact opposite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with “no clear link established,” the mere suggestion of a link may be troubling to parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attkisson has been carrying water for the anti-vaccine movement for years. Last September, &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31727_162-20015982-10391695.html"&gt;she mischaracterized&lt;/a&gt; the Hannah Poling case as an admission by the US government that vaccines cause autism. And here she is, only a year ago, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/complain_to_cbs_cbs_resident_anti-vaccin.php"&gt;massaging Andrew Wakefield’s&lt;/a&gt; bruised ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major lesson from &lt;em&gt;l’affaire Wakefield&lt;/em&gt; is that reporting on scientific research is no small thing, and comes with great responsibility. Dick Ahlstrom, writing &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2011/0128/1224288136964.html"&gt;in today’s Irish Times&lt;/a&gt;, could be speaking directly to Attkisson when he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance in journalism generally means presenting both sides of a  story, allowing all those involved to state their views. Striking this  balance should allow the journalist to remain neutral on the issue. We  present the facts and readers form their own opinions on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  what are facts and how can we know they are true? Achieving balance is  supposed to overcome this problem for the journalist – we don’t have to  be experts on a subject, we just have to report honestly and accurately  on what is said and present the views of both sides, leaving it up to  the reader to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet achieving that balance can in itself  throw a story severely off balance, with reportage on climate change a  perfect example. Balance dictates that the reporter should give an equal  amount of linage to those who argue that the changes we are seeing in  the climate and the persistent warming trends are caused by human  activity and to those “climate sceptics” who say it is caused by changes  in the sun or other natural phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides of this  argument will present scientific data, or “facts”, to prove what they  say is true. Both sides will quote professors and throw in scientific  findings but the public – like the reporter – will not automatically  know which set of “facts” is more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If normal journalistic  balance is applied then both arguments will be presented as having  equal weight. But this ignores the reality of the research findings in  climate change. While both sides can quote their professors and experts,  more than 95 per cent of all the research findings support claims for  human induced climate change. Findings quoted by the climate sceptics  represent only a tiny fraction of all the research being done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless Attkisson has been reporting from a cave for the last few years, she should know that the vast weight of evidence speaks against a vaccine-autism link. To suggest otherwise, via her triple-bank shot association of unrelated facts, makes her unfit as a health and science reporter. It is also symptomatic of a larger problem at CBS News.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; CBS scrubbed the last paragraph of Attkisson’s report which referred to the University of  Colorado Denver School of Medicine study. The author of that paper told LeftBrainRightBrain that the type of seizures that typically follow vaccination are not the same as the seizures which are discussed in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

How important are those claims to what religion really is, and how we should think about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers has posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/stephen_asma_responds.php"&gt;a very interesting letter from Stephen Asma&lt;/a&gt; that talks about this issue.  Asma earlier wrote&lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Atheists-Narrow/126027/"&gt; a critique of New Atheism&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, to which PZ &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/substance_over_sweetness_anoth.php"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;, but I think the new letter is more interesting than the previous salvos.  &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2011/01/myers-and-asma-debate-asmas-views.html"&gt;Russell Blackford&lt;/a&gt; has also chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very healthy discussion to be having — moving a bit beyond the caricatures of atheism by believers, and of religion by atheists.  Much of what Asma says I find quite persuasive.  The crux is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My argument is that religion helps people, rightly or wrongly, manage their emotional lives. And while it doesn’t do very much for me and other skeptics (I prefer art), I would be very inattentive if I failed to notice how much relief and comfort it gave to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asma wants to consider the aspects of religion that are closer to those of art or literature than those of science.  There’s no question that religions have beneficial effects along with their bad ones.  If we’re being rational about it, we should try to understand how those effects work, even if our only agenda is to find some sort of acceptable substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were starting from scratch I would put it this way:  some of the sense of wonder and anticipation of possibility that defines us as human is often categorized under the heading of “religion.”  We can raise questions about the truthfulness of religion’s attempts to describe how the world works, while at the same time respecting some of the careful thought that religious people have put into understanding the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But … there’s usually a “but.”  I have to wonder about these attempts to completely downplay the role of truth-claims in religious belief.  In my experience, when I hear someone arguing that the important aspects of religion are moral or aesthetic, and the statements about how the world works are an unfortunate bit of historical baggage, it usually is not coming from a religious person, but rather from a sympathetic non-believer.  My impression is that the way a religion views the world is actually quite important to a typical believer.  I have in mind both very specific kinds of claims, that God created the world some number of years ago or that we are sorted into various afterlives depending on our Earthly track record, or more vague ones, that God allows the world to be or that moments of transcendence represent connection with a higher power.  I don’t think these are unimportant to most religious believers, even most very sophisticated ones (I could be wrong).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, needless to say, views about how the world works are very often central to the other aspects of religious belief.  If you really believe in Heaven and Hell, you’d be crazy not to let that belief influence your view of morality here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I’m all in favor of understanding the nature of religious belief and also exhibiting a willingness to learn from believers who have thought long and hard about philosophy or ethics or what have you, I don’t foresee having a truly open and respectful dialogue without putting questions of how the world really works front and center.  If we took a religion and removed from it any claims about how the world works, leaving a set of ideas about morality and human life, would it make sense to even call the result a religion? It would be more like a philosophy or worldview, and those are things that even we atheists are more than happy to engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we don’t always do a good job of that engagement.  I look forward to the day when “atheism” as a worldview takes difficult emotional human questions more seriously in a public way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1969, an astronomer named Jeremiah Ostriker realized that the Milky Way was spinning too fast. That may sound odd, given that it takes the sun 230 million years to make a full orbit. But when Ostriker tried to simulate the Milky Way on a computer, he found that it was spinning so quickly that it should have ripped itself apart long ago. There weren’t enough stars to hold it together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ostriker went to his fellow Princeton scientist James Peebles to share his puzzle. “There’s something wrong here,” Ostriker said to Peebles.

Oh, how I love science.

But, I digress.

For a few years now countless food manufacturers have been “sub-packaging” their foods into smaller portions in an apparent effort to curb folks from overindulging. You can usually find 100 kcal multi-packs of chips, pretzels, chocolates, and all sorts of junk foods. Despite the very obvious negative environmental impact of all this excess packaging, I was always curious what, if any, impact such packaging might have on people’s consumption.

Well, I didn’t have to wonder for too long as Wansink and colleagues recently published a paper in the journal Obesity investigating this very question.

I recently discussed a previous study by Wansink that essentially showed that when snacks are served in bigger bowls, people tend to eat more of their contents.

Thus, it would seem reasonable to think the reverse was also true in terms of small packages for snacks, as in the case with these hyper-packaged 100kcal bags of junk.

So the same authors sought to address this issue, and also to check if the effect on consumption of small packages differed between overweight and normal weight individuals.

A total of 42 undergraduate students participated in the simple study which basically had the participants snack on crackers while watching a sitcom – now THAT is what I call research!

Half of the participants were given one large 400-calorie package of crackers or a similar-sized package that had then been sub-divided into four smaller 100-calorie sub-packaged crackers. They were blinded to the purpose of the study.

After watching the show, the crackers not consumed by the participants were counted to calculate everyone’s caloric intake. Also, each participant was asked how many crackers they think they consumed.

Turns out, overweight participants ate significantly more crackers when eating from one large package than from four small packages. In fact, they consumed more than double the number of calories with the bigger package: 384 calories versus 176 calories.

Surprisingly, there was no difference in consumption between package conditions among the normal-weight participants.

Despite this difference in consumption, what is odd is that all groups (small package and big package, overweight and normal weight) underestimated how many crackers they had eaten by more than 60%!

This suggests that the smaller packaging doesn’t make people more accurate at keeping track of what they ate.

So why the difference between overweight and normal weight participants?

The authors suggest the following:

“Obese people were more likely to rely on external cues to stop eating, [and thus] the perception of package count might play a crucial role for overweight participants in determining their food intake.”

Don’t you just love science?

Have a great weekend,

Peter

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, there is a lot of fat to cut from our public schools, especially those in our biggest urban areas like Houston and Dallas. I am concerned that some the highly diverse Magnet public schools in this city are becoming hotbeds for liberalism.  Do we really need free school bus service, Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian-Pacific Heritage Month, ESL, special needs and enrichment programs like music, art or math Olympiad? I think we should get back to the basics of the three Rs, reading writing and arithmetic. I mean when is the last time a 6th grade science fair project yielded a cure for a disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same talk, he also babbles about making private Christian schools more affordable. Kill public education, promote religion instead. That's his position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When's the insurrection? Or at least the repeal? Don't Texans have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; self-respect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classicists and anthropologists have traced kissing history over millennium. The earliest and best literary evidence we have dates to around 1500 B.C. from India’s Vedic Sanskrit texts. While there were no words for “kissing,” there are intriguing lines such as the “young lord of the house repeatedly licks the young woman.” Later, the &lt;em&gt;Vatsyayana Kamasutra&lt;/em&gt; (better known as the “Kama Sutra”) composed sometime around the third century A.D. includes an entire chapter devoted to kissing a lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, people in India were kissing thousands of years ago, but it’s doubtful they were the only ones doing so… &lt;a href="http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2011/01/the-kiss-in-history.html"&gt;Read on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Campus security got video footage of Petrov in the act when they set up video cameras following the discovery of &amp;quot;puddles of what they thought was urine.&amp;quot;

You may be asking yourself, what the heck was this dude thinking? How should we interpret the behavior of this Homo mathematicus (not that there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with it) specimen?

Fortunately, once again, Science!™ has an answer for you. Urine is commonly used as a scent marker to deter competitors. But deter them from what? Traditionally, it has been assumed that scent marking is primarily used to defend territory against intruders, thereby safeguarding resources such as food and space. However, some recent studies have suggested that scent marking may be used to defend mates and mating opportunities. One of the difficulties in studying such a question, however, is that in many systems, competitors for territory and competitors for mates are the same individuals.

A recent study by a group of researchers in the UK, Uganda, and Switzerland have attempted to separate out these two forms of competition in a study of the wild banded mongoose. This species lives in large social groups that share a territory. Thus territorial competition occurs primarily between different social groups, whereas competition over mates occurs primarily within groups.

&amp;quot;Anal gland secretion (AGS) and urine samples were collected under anaesthesia during routine trapping events&amp;quot;  Image licensed under creative commons from Mike Rohde&amp;#39;s Flickr photostream.

The researchers found that the mongoose populations marked uniformly throughout their territory, and did not appear to increase the frequency of marking in those regions where two territories overlapped. This suggests that, in this species at least, defense of mates and mating opportunities represents a major contribution to scent-marking behavior, perhaps more so than territorial defense.

So, can we extrapolate from the behavior of the wild banded mongoose to the behavior of wild banded mathematician Tihomir Petrov? Of course we can! Should we extrapolate? Absolutely not! But, here at Lost in Transcription, we&amp;#39;re all about the possible, so here is the take-home message. Castle and Beckett should look beyond professional disputes between the two mathematicians. They need to be looking at the love-triangle angle (Love angle4?) for motive.

Alternate theory: As Northridge is, like, the pr0n capital of the country, Petrov might not have been the original urinator. When he saw that the cameras had been set up, he might have assumed that he had been cast in a movie, and that peeing on the floor was what was expected of him. Just sayin&amp;#39;.

I'll blockquote his comments:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am giving you evidence that counts for me.  I doubt that you will consider it extraordinary, or that it will persuade you very far.  I am not giving you evidence to change your mind.  I am giving you four pieces of evidence that encourage my mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He has more to say than this but notice his admission. He's arguing from a position rather than to a position. Faith based reasoning is like this. It’s a belief in search of data.&lt;blockquote&gt;ONE, In Acts 18:2, Luke records that a Jewish couple named Aquilla and Pricilla had recently come from Italy to Corinth (where Paul was) because Claudius had expelled all Jews from Rome.  The Roman historian Suetonius records this in his Life of Claudius 25:4, and adds that this order from Claudius came because of a commotion caused by a certain "Chrestus." This edict of Claudius is universally dated to 49 CE, plus or minus one year.  Most NT historians consider it probable that "Chrestus" is "Christ," and that Suetonius who writes some time later (i.e. 112 C.E.) is slightly misinformed about the exact name.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It was a common name meaning “good.” &lt;blockquote&gt;It would certainly fit with what we know, that Jews who thought Jesus was Christ and those who thought otherwise would be at each other throats.  Even Haenchen, who for other reasons thinks Luke made this story up, and thinks Luke made up most of Acts, assumes that the preaching of Jesus in Rome is what got Jews expelled from Rome in 49.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why did the preaching of Christ in Rome cause just the Jews to be expelled? If we take Acts seriously then the preaching of Christ in Ephesus and Athens caused quite a commotion among pagans too. And so it strikes me as really odd that just the Jews were expelled from the huge city of Rome because of the commotion over Christ. All of them? This assumes a large number of Christians in Rome at the time before Paul ever got there. Who were these Christians? And who founded the Roman church? Conservatives D.A. Carson, Douglas Moo and Leon Morris in their &lt;i&gt;Introduction to the NT&lt;/i&gt; claim it wasn’t Peter nor any other apostle. They “speculate” (their word) that it was a Jewish Christianity coming from the people who were in Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost. What did they believe? And if they were all expelled from Rome who was Paul writing to in his Roman epistle in the “early-mid 50s” (a point I’ll make later)?&lt;blockquote&gt;I get two things from this.  One is that Jesus of Nazareth was probably being preached in Rome in 49, less than 20 years after being crucified in Jerusalem.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;We cannot assume what exactly was being preached in Rome if correct, and that’s an important point. Paul had to correct the Corinthian church even after preaching there, so what gives us any assurance that the followers of Chrestus were preaching anything like what Paul was doing before he visited? And since Suetonius never mentioned Jesus of Nazareth why must we assume that Chrestus was Christ and that Christ was Jesus? The Roman world was a huge one. Even Paul tells us there were many people preaching different savior messiah type Christs. Since his letter to the Romans contains the gospel message of Paul in its most detailed form, he was obviously teaching them true Christian doctrine. It was his systematic theology so to speak, and the reason he felt the need to write it was most probably because he wanted to make sure the Roman church was in line with what he preached.&lt;blockquote&gt;That in itself would witness to the remarkable courage and conviction of the first generation of believers. Where did they get the courage and conviction to preach so aggressively? &lt;/blockquote&gt;Not so at all. Many people have been willing to die for a delusion.&lt;blockquote&gt;This is about those who would have seen and known Jesus himself. &lt;/blockquote&gt;What? How does he know this? If anything the people causing a stir had not seen Jesus at all. This is a huge unreasonable leap of faith. There are simply too many unevidenced assumptions here. This is not what history can show us. It’s belief in search of data.&lt;blockquote&gt;The other thing is that Luke seems in touch with the history of the time of Paul. TWO, in Acts 18:12 Luke reports that while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia (capital city: Corinth), the Jews of Corinth took Paul before Gallio on some charge.  At one time Gallio in Corinth at all was considered nonesense, but an inscription found in Delphi indicates that Claudius made Gallio proconsul of Achaia in 50-51 CE.  ONE and TWO are almost the only places where events in Acts touch things in the outside world that can be confirmed by other sources.  These two match up nicely with date and place, and these are used universally (by conservatives and flaming liberals alike) to date the life of Paul.  It takes a certain kind of faith to assume that Luke was careful in these matters where we can check on him, and fraudulent everywhere else.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wait just a minute. One cannot conclude that if Luke is right in these things he must be right in all other things. Again, this is not what historians do. This is what believers do. Historians must check out the other claims being made in an ancient document even if a few of them turn out to be correct. In fact, historians actually reverse this whole process. To the degree an author gets his facts wrong is to the same degree they question what he says when they can’t examine his claims. &lt;blockquote&gt;THREE, the letter of Romans.  In our Bibles 13 letters are attributed to Paul….four letters are held to be the essential Paul: Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians.  I have never heard of any NT scholar, no matter how negative and sceptical, who put any shadow on these at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romans was written in the early-mid 50s.  All these people agree with that.  Paul has never been to Rome, and says so clearly in that letter, but we also realize by the end of the letter that there is large and well established church in Rome, made up of both Jews and Gentiles.  (Claudius' edict was relaxed after a couple years, and Jews came back.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;I would like to know how he knows the edict was “relaxed.” I would think that if there is evidence for his assertion he would have given it. Maybe there is. If so, I want to see it. My guess is that he is special pleading. He takes it as a given the Jews were expelled from Rome in 49 C.E. and then he takes it as a given that if Paul wrote a letter to the Christian church in Rome in the early 50s that's all the evidence he needs to believe the edict was relaxed after just a couple of years. Again, belief in search of data I presume (until shown otherwise). Special pleading takes place when in order to establish the historicity of a claim made in the Bible a person makes reference to the Bible in order to do so. &lt;blockquote&gt;By the mid 50s a large church exists in Rome.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;A large church? What is that? We have mega churches in today’s world but back then? Hardly. All we have is Paul’s letter. As I skim read it just now it’s really hard to determine how large that church was. In chapter 16 Paul writes directly to different people and their households in the Roman church. But how could he know them if he had not yet visited there (1:10, 13; 15:22)? The doxology (16:25-26) is omitted in some manuscripts and appears in different places in others, particularly after chapter 14 or after chapter 15. Some manuscripts omit chapters 15 and 16 entirely. Some scholars conclude this was added later by someone else.&lt;blockquote&gt;This makes clear what I suggested in ONE, that the first 20 years of Christian preachers were remarkably confident and agressive.  Travelling and preaching in those days was not an easy life.  What moved them?  Why do they risk all to speak everywhere about Jesus of Nazareth, the hope of the whole world?&lt;/blockquote&gt;Many believers have been aggressive, remarkably confident and willing to sacrifice a huge amount for spreading a delusion. And again, we cannot say exactly what they preached about Chrestus.&lt;blockquote&gt;FOUR, 1 Corinthians.  In 1 Cor 15:1-3 Paul recites a few lines about Jesus' resurrection.  He makes clear that he was taught this, he received it as important teaching from someone else.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Funny thing is that Paul emphatically denies having learned his gospel from anyone else in Galatians 1:11-12. He uses the exact same Greek words too (“having received”). So on the one hand he says he “received” what he preached from the apostles and on the other hand he claims not to have “received” his gospel from them but through a revelation instead. In fact after recounting Paul’s conversion story three times in Acts Paul tells King Agrippa what he saw was a “vision.” Yep, just see Acts 26:9: “So then, King Agrippa, I (Paul) was not disobedient to the vision (i.e. ὀπτασίᾳ) from heaven.” And then in I Corinthians 15 Paul equates his vision with what the other apostles experienced saying Jesus appeared to them as he did to him. The word “vision” plays prominently in Luke-Acts. Paul was led by them. Peter and Cornelius had one, as did Joseph, Mary and Zechariah (the Baptist’s father). The Apostle Peter’s vision took place while he was in a trance in Acts 10:10 and 11:15. Likewise Paul was in a trance when he had one in Acts 22:17!&lt;blockquote&gt;1 Corinthians is written in the early 50s.  He was in Corinth in 50.  When he was in Corinth, he says in his later letter, he gave them these few important lines about Jesus' resurrection and witnesses who saw him alive after his crucifixion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Paul says there were 500 eyewitnesses. Why is it the gospels failed to mention this tidbit of information? And who among the believers in Corinth could travel to Jerusalem and interview them? Paul fails to say that some of these so-called eyewitnesses doubted (Matthew 28:17). How is that possible? And we know that the overwhelming numbers of Jews who were there did not believe who also believed in Yahweh and that he does miracles. If it didn't convince them why should it convince us?&lt;blockquote&gt;So Paul preached it in 50, and got it at some time before that.  We don't know how long before that.  According to Acts it could have been 10 years earlier, but let's just say 5 years earlier.  The resurrection of Jesus is central teaching, the core of the gospel according to 1 Cor 15, by 15 years after Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In I Corinthians 15 Paul equates his vision with what the other apostles experienced saying Jesus “appeared” (same word) to them just as he did to him.&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not prove that what Paul was taught was correct; of course not.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;There is a lot of doubt about this, yes.&lt;blockquote&gt;But we ARE finding out what moved those early missionaries, why they were so confident and aggressive, why they risked their lives. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, this shows nothing.&lt;blockquote&gt;They thought Jesus had risen from the dead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again without special pleading we don’t know from Suetonius what they believed. And we have really good reasons to think they did not agree with Paul who continually had to write letters telling other church groups what they should believe.&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course this does not prove that Jesus rose.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;As I have stated before, in my world miracles do not happen. What world is he living in? If they do not happen in today’s world then they did not happen in first-century Palestine. That’s a historian’s perspective. Historians must re-examine the claims made in history from their present perspective. They cannot do otherwise. &lt;blockquote&gt;There are two other options at hand: one is that there was some great fraud in which a few liars at the very beginning fooled everyone else, and the other is that the first followers were fooled in some way, into thinking Jesus had risen when he had not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The third option is that religions evolve. They have always evolved as they come into contact with other cultures. The apocalyptic Jesus cult in first century Palestine had to come to grips with this failed prophecy of the coming of the “Son of Man,” while interacting with and trying to convert the Greco-Roman world. &lt;blockquote&gt;I'm not going to deal with either of those here.  Something happened early on, something huge in the minds of those around it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This conclusion rings hollow. Failed apocalyptic doomsday cults who subsequently reinterpret their failed prophecies are a dime a dozen.&lt;blockquote&gt;My point in all this is that there is good evidence that Christianity spread rapidly in the first 20-25 years, an early enough time that the memory of Jesus himself is a key factor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, we have no idea what spread rapidly. Christianity was evolving. There is substantial evidence in the NT itself that there were alternative Christianities and Christs. They just blended in time.&lt;blockquote&gt;SOMETHING remarkable happened at the start, there in Jerusalem.  I don't see how that can be avoided.  People do avoid it, but no one in scholarly circles.  There are many NT scholars out there more or less in Bultmann's camp.  He believed that Jesus was born, and that he died, and Bultmann did not think we had any more solid information than that. Lot's still like that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is one historical conclusion when looking at the evidence as a historian must do. The alternative he proposes is special pleading from a faith based reasoning.&lt;blockquote&gt;But none of them doubt that the first 20 years of believers preached fearlessly and relentlessly that Jesus was the hope of the world, and that there was an established church in Rome and many other Mediterranean cities by 25 years after Christ.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Perhaps so, but we're interested in knowing what they preached and if they had reasons to believe.&lt;blockquote&gt;If it was not the remarkable person of Jesus of Nazareth himself, culminating in his death and resurrection, what was it?  They shrug and say they don't know.  Something happened.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is a gross mischaracterization. Plenty of views have been suggested, as I do. The visionary basis for the view Jesus arose from the dead beginning with either Peter or Mary Magdalene works just fine. But non-believers emphatically do not have to propose an alternative scenario at all. A historian can look at an argument purporting to show what happened at Custer’s Last Stand and say that scenario is improbable without having to suggest a better one. It could well be that there isn’t enough evidence to say one way or another after showing one such scenario is improbable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3579983545480672900?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dirge without music
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground&lt;br&gt;
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind: &lt;br&gt;
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. Crowned &lt;br&gt;
With lilies and laurel they go: but I am not resigned. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you. &lt;br&gt;
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust. &lt;br&gt;
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew, &lt;br&gt;
A formula, a phrase remains - but the best is lost. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love - &lt;br&gt;
They are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled &lt;br&gt;
Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve. &lt;br&gt;
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave &lt;br&gt;
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind: &lt;br&gt;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. &lt;br&gt;
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful words somehow bring a little comfort to us, I agree, but better still are beautiful words that also ring true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/the_best_is_lost.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/N0WcaBZGFck" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296234878816"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=216377">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/455c154c7363cce7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="eating healthy"/><category term="junk-food"/><category term="nutrition"/><category term="obesity"/><category term="party recipes"/><category term="Super Bowl 2011"/><category term="Super Bowl party food"/><category term="working out"/><title type="html">Not Watching the Game?

Last year, it was estimated that 153.1 million viewers caught a portion of the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts battle for the Vince Lombardi Trophy (even if it was just to watch the halftime show). This year, fans will watch the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Green Bay Packers in Arlington, Texas on Sunday, February 6th. With so much pomp and circumstance (and profit) built around one game, it’s nearly impossible to avoid the hype and excitement. But whether or not you’re a football fan, there are plenty of ways to celebrate Super Bowl Sunday that don’t involve actually watching men in tight pants tossing around a pigskin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Physical Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you chow down at that Super Bowl party (but hopefully not on &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/super-bowl-sunday-worst-party-foods-half-time/"&gt;these 10 unhealthy party foods&lt;/a&gt;), run yourself ragged in a race. Running clubs across the country organize Super Bowl Sunday races to help couch potatoes burn a few calories before a long evening of pizza, beer, and chicken wings. In New York City, the New York Road Runners Club will sponsor the annual “&lt;a href="http://www.nyrr.org/races/2011/r0206x00.asp"&gt;Gridiron Classic and Longest Football Throw Competition&lt;/a&gt;.” The football-throwing competition begins at 8 a.m. in Central Park, followed by a 9 a.m. race time. Registration is limited and required, so don’t wait to sign up. If you live in Sacramento, California, the annual &lt;a href="http://www.changeofpace.com/davis_stampede.html"&gt;Davis Stampede&lt;/a&gt; will take place on game day. Known as the unofficial kick-off to the Sacramento run/walk season, the 28-year-old Davis Stampede includes 5K, 10K, and half-marathon events. And there are dozens more races and walks being held across the country on Super Bowl Sunday. For more info, or to find a race near you, check out the “find an event” page at the &lt;a href="http://www.rrca.org/search/events-results/"&gt;Road Runners Club of America&lt;/a&gt;, or check with your local running club for more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support a Charity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many local charity organizations create their own events to raise money and awareness on Super Bowl Sunday, but one of the largest national charities is the &lt;a href="http://www.souperbowl.org/"&gt;Souper Bowl of Caring&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1990 by several South Carolina church groups, together they united around Super Bowl weekend and collected $5,700 worth of food and money for the needy. And in 2010, the Souper Bowl of Caring – along with 260,000 participants – raised an astounding $10 million in cash and food for local hunger-based charities. (This year the goal is $11 million.) Every group that participates in the Souper Bowl of Caring nominates a local hunger-relief charity, and 100% of all funds and food raised by that group goes directly to their earmarked charity. To search for a Souper Bowl event or group in your area, enter your zip code on the &lt;a href="http://souperbowl.org/"&gt;upper-right corner of their homepage&lt;/a&gt;. If no local groups are sponsoring a Souper Bowl event in your area, you can easily participate by &lt;a href="http://souperbowl.org/support/donate/"&gt;donating online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Something Else on TV (If You Have Another TV, and It’s Not Showing the Super Bowl)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may feel like every channel on TV caters to football fanatics during this time of year, there’s plenty of cheeky alternative programming on Super Bowl Sunday that maintains the day’s spirit – minus the overpaid, gladiator-like superstars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv/puppy-bowl/"&gt;Puppy Bowl VII&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, on Animal Planet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the antithesis to the Super Bowl: Adorable puppy teammates, a Blimp piloted by a hamster crew, and a “puppy cam.” For the seventh straight year, cable channel Animal Planet will air its Puppy Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday at 3 p.m. EST. Watch adorable pups roll around on a field while an Emmy-Award-winning announcer details the action like a professional sports reporter. You can even see this particular bowl in 3-D. To see the starting lineup and past Puppy Bowl highlights, checkout the &lt;a href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv/puppy-bowl/"&gt;Animal Planet website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Toilet Bowl Marathon&lt;/em&gt;, on &lt;a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/"&gt;DIY Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If do-it-yourself endeavors are your thing, DIY Network will be running a 17-hour marathon of bathroom renovation projects. Believe it or not, this is the Toilet Bowl Marathon’s fourth year, and DIY shows including BATHtastic!, Bath Crashers, 10 Killer Bathroom Projects, and America’s Ugliest Bathrooms will be airing all day long. With 22 million people completing bathroom renovation projects each year, according to DIY General Manager Andy Singer, the Toilet Bowl Marathon is sure to inspire (or make you feel depressed about the state of your own john). As an added bonus, DIY will give away 30 bedazzled toilet bowl seats to &lt;a href="http://blog.diynetwork.com/tool-tips/"&gt;readers of its blog &lt;/a&gt;starting on January 27. For more info, visit the &lt;a href="http://www.diynetwork.com/"&gt;DIY website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/dallas_cowboys_cheerleaders_making_the_team/series.jhtml"&gt;Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, on CMT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a personal guilty pleasure, and if you’ve never had the chance to catch CMT’s &lt;em&gt;Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team&lt;/em&gt;, Super Bowl Sunday is the perfect day to watch a marathon of past episodes. Think “beauty pageant” meets “dance competition,” with a dash of ditz and glitz. Watch what it takes to be a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader from the initial audition, through the training process, and up to game day. Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader director Kelli Finglass makes an Army drill sergeant look tame. And if you love watching beauty queens crumble under the pressure of big hair, makeup, tough questions and even tougher dance routines, this is one marathon train wreck not to miss.&lt;/p&gt;

It confirms entirely my impressions from years of freshman college students and from previous studies of the subject, and puts specific numbers and issues to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short summary: public schools suck at teaching basic biology. You already knew this, too, though, didn't you? The question has always been, "How bad?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now say how many high school biology teachers do a good job, teaching the recommendations of the National Research Council and also, by the way, obeying the requirements of most state science standards: 28%. About a quarter of our biology teachers are actually discussing the evidence that evolution occurred and using evolution as a theme to integrate the components of a good year of biology instruction. And since most school curricula only include one year of life science, that effectively means that only about a quarter of our high school graduates are even exposed to evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also another problem. 13% of our biology teachers are openly and unashamedly creationists who teach creationism in the classroom. That number varies, by the way, with the political leanings of the citizens of the school district: 40% of the teachers in conservative school districts reject evolution entirely, while "only" 11% in liberal areas do. This is a disaster. This is active, ongoing miseducation and misrepresentation of science by the teachers we entrust with our children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the rest? 60% of our teachers do nothing: they teach the bare minimum of evolution that they can get away with, focusing on details of genetics and molecular biology that allow them to avoid the more obvious implications (which shouldn't happen, either; the molecular evidence for evolution is powerful stuff), or they allow it to slip off the schedule of lesson plans. They're afraid, and rightly so, of aggressive, nasty, privileged religious parents who will make their life hellish if they do their job properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper did surprise me in one way. It made a very strong statement about those timid teachers in the 60%:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cautious 60% may play a far more important role in hindering scientific literacy in the United States than the smaller number of explicit creationists. The strategies of emphasizing microevolution, justifying the curriculum on the basis of state-wide tests, or "teaching the controversy" all undermine the legitimacy of findings that are well established by the combination of peer review and replication. These teachers fail to explain the nature of scientific inquiry, undermine the authority of established experts, and legitimize creationist arguments, even if unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a teacher who avoids the subject of evolution because of the crapstorm of chaos that follows from the public if you do? Consider yourselves rebuked. You &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; aren't helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are we going to do about this? The authors have two major suggestions, and here's where I get to feel rebuked. One problem is that many of the timid teachers also do not feel adequately trained to address evolution well, and that's a significant factor in their reluctance to press the topic (creationist teachers, on the other hand, are full of unwarranted certainty and lie to their students with confidence). So they recommend that there be more thorough training in evolution for pre-service teachers, with at least a requirement for one course in evolution. I think I can say that my university does a good job at that, at least: our secondary education majors get a rigorous exposure to evolutionary biology in our program. If you're looking to hire new science teachers, look to UMM graduates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion, though, is that scientists and science organizations ought to be doing more outreach and assistance. That's tough, since our time is tight, but we know that would be a good goal. When a group of us put together the &lt;a href="http://www.mnsci.org/"&gt;Minnesota Citizens for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, one of the goals was to provide speakers and yearly seminar courses to help teachers learn more about evolution, and we did a good job the first year. But that effort was made at a time when there was active pressure from creationist groups to influence the state science standards, and as that pressure eased off, so did we, and we've been slacking ever since. The framework is there so we could fire it up again quickly, but maybe we ought also to be maintaining good science education in these lulls between storms, too.&lt;/p&gt;

How long does it take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never fear, YouTube has the answer.  They have &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, so if you just search for “eagle sex” you’ll find a pair of bald eagles filmed &lt;em&gt;in flagrante delicto&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/28/when-eagles-mate/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/d5S0Hi9GXvs/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in most birds, the act takes only a few seconds (seven by my count), and is preceded by a lot of mutual singing.  If you watch carefully at the end, you’ll see the female light a cigarette while the male flies off to brag to his buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

This school assembly followed a series of classroom lessons about space - our solar system, the moon, and exploration. 

As the world turns, it often takes tragedy to so well ingrain lessons to be learned, and this case was no exception. As I sat there with three classrooms worth of schoolmates, I watched seven people die while chasing a dream, and for the benefit of mankind. The STS-51L Challenger Shuttle had exploded - on national television in front of millions of people.

Image via WikipediaThere was a look of horror embedded on the faces of our teachers at the assembly, and confusion amongst the kids...the implications of death just don&amp;#39;t penetrate a youthful innocence.

This NASA tragedy echoed the halls of my school - the extent of my far-reaching world - for months. To be honest, until reading about the Challenger anniversary this morning, I probably never gave the incident another thought. Today, however, the broader implications of such a tragedy resonate loudly amongst a much larger adult world, especially given my chosen professional path.

Regardless of the billions of dollars spent on NASA-level engineering on all aspects of manned space exploration, there remains a degree of risk - likewise for ocean exploration (in fact the synonymy runs deep with the Challenger Shuttle being named after the HMS Challenger oceanographic voyage of 1872). Though, understanding the risk of exploration should bring an appreciation that the efforts are not &amp;#39;risky&amp;#39;.Risk managers can analyze this inside and out, but when it comes time for lift off, or that deep descent, no amount of training, knowledge, or technology ever accounts for all of it. While this risk is perceived as the foremost danger in exploration, it is also the excitement - that is the seeking out of an unknown time, space, and having that experience - and is a fundamental driver inherent in human nature.

The risk of exploration is not something that we dwell on before a mission, in fact its far from. Rather the risks are embedded in our subconscious and help guide us through minimizing human-factored margins of error to keep the engineers and risk manages back on terra firma confident that all is going &amp;#39;according to plan&amp;#39;. However, even when people do everything right, there is an element of both faith and fate that cannot be calculated, and this is understood at deep levels for all of those who have been there.

Today, I encourage you to lend some time to thinking about  the Challenger crew members who died January 28, 1986 -  Ellison S. Onizuka, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, Greg Jarvis, Judy Resnik, Mike Smith, Dick Scobee, and Ron McNair. Their efforts should be celebrated, as they left all preconceived notions of risk behind to take steps towards improving our body of knowledge here on Earth, and beyond, and for the benefit of all of us.

Their previous teacher assigned only even problems from their book. In most books today, the evens are the students favorite because they have answers in the back of the book so they can "check" their answers. Or, if they can't quite figure out the answer, they can look and try to reverse engineer it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't particularly mind this. Checking the answer lets you know if you made a mistake and, if you did, you get practice finding mistakes as well as correcting them. Reverse engineering problems makes flexible thinkers who can view math as a set of tools that goes two ways instead of a strict linear process that can only be applied one way in one situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, I don't like students to rely on this too much. They argue that homework is still learning (which it is) so they should have as much help on it as humanly possible. I remind them that they already have a pretty phenomenal amount of resources available to them: They have my lecture (from which I hope they took notes), the book complete with examples that are exactly the same with swapped out numbers, and in many cases, each other. So I don't feel too much pressure to give them &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; even numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So on this first homework assignment I gave a mix of odds and evens. Some they could "check". Some they couldn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, I found two common patterns for mistakes. The first was simply not reading the instructions. When it asks how many solutions a set of linear equations has, that question needs to be answered. Don't just draw the graph and leave me to do the rest of your thinking by seeing it only has one, or none, or an infinite number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second common mistake was (oddly enough) only on even problems. It was students having the answer to the &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; even problem. They'd written the problem right, gone through some algebra voodoo magic, and then amazingly arrived at the answer for the next problem. The only way I can explain this is that they did what they felt was enough work to arrive at the answer, "checked" it, wrote down the book's answer but because the answers are all squished together in the back, wrote down the wrong line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So much for actually "checking" anything or taking that solution and reverse engineering it to meet your work. I'll be sticking to the evens now.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8766665066676089798?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296231177431"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2930">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d491ffb6a583df79</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Peeving"/><title type="html">Annals of word rage</title><published>2011-01-28T16:00:48Z</published><updated>2011-01-28T16:00:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2930" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a recent post at Jezebel, Sadie Stein  documents the usage of &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; as in intensifier, and the often-intense negative reaction, both to the word-sense itself and to its sometimes-spectacularly-frequent deployment ("&lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/5745076/saying-literally-all-the-time-is-literally-an-issue"&gt;Saying 'Literally' All The Time Is Literally An Issue&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;

The teacher on board was incinerated before their very eyes.  As the explosion developed, shooting out huge arms of smoke and the voice-over began to acknowledge that something was wrong, NASA's space program was suddenly transformed, in the eyes of the innocent little children of America almost all of whom were watching the event live, from a somewhat interesting science project to a place where teachers went to die.  I had never really visualized Amanda as a little girl before, but a few years ago when this came up, on the Anniversary of the Challenger explosion, this image formed as a lump in my throat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a few years older than Amanda, so my experience was a little different.  I had just returned form the Congo.  I had borrowed a car ... a Laser, which is a sort of sports car ... and driven it to a friend's apartment downtown over an Italian restaurant and tavern, and parked it on a snow bank out front.  That's normal for Upstate New York. By the time morning came, the car was more than a little stuck, so I called Triple-A to pull it out.  I made the call from the tavern, and while doing so I noticed that the Challenger launch was being shown on the TV.  So I stood at the bar and watched the launch.  And the explosion.  When the tow truck came, I mentioned to the driver that the Challenger had just exploded.  He thought for a moment and said, shaking his head slowly, "You're not gonna get me on that thing.  No sir!"  I thought ... yeah, that might be a tough sell from this point forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that when NASA started the Shuttle program, they made an estimate of risk of death to those who would be on board.  Given the number of flights and the number of deadly events and the number of those killed, they're apparently right in the expected range.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Twenty Fifth Anniversary Challenger Explosion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Astrological Association of Great Britain was so incensed that they created a &lt;a href="http://www.astrologicalassociation.com/pages/bbc/submit.php"&gt;petition demanding that the BBC commit to "making a fair and balanced representation of astrology in the future"&lt;/a&gt; — which left me amusedly discombobulated that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a formal Astrological Association of Great Britain, and that they don't realize that tossing their whole goofy discipline in the rubbish heap is a fair and balanced representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get a whole new level of foolishness, though: &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/jan/28/1?CMP=twt_fd"&gt;Martin Robbins has posted a criticism of the skeptics from a serious historian&lt;/a&gt; who doesn't get it. She demands that we take astrology more seriously and respectfully, and explains that many astrologers are intelligent people who study astronomy (you know, the real science), and are fully aware of concepts like precession and the actual physical arrangements of the stars in the sky, and have quite sophisticated explanations to account for superficial discrepancies like the absence of Ophiuchus from the official list of zodiacal constellations, and that they are right to be annoyed when they are portrayed as unaware of obvious physical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all true, but stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had long conversations with Very Serious Astrologers; early in my skeptical career, I spent a fair amount of time engaging them, and I'm familiar with the diverse ways in which their brains work. They were generally engrossed with the behavior of those lights in the sky; if you wanted to know what constellation you could spot on the horizon in the western sky in August, you could ask an astronomer and get a good answer, or you could ask a dedicated astrologer and they'd tell you the same thing, and they were certainly far more reliable sources for that sort of information than I am. I've played with some of their software, and it is intricate and elaborate and uses genuine astronomical data that they gather from astronomical databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But so what? It&amp;#39;s still all rubbish. There&amp;#39;s more to science than mastering mechanics, there&amp;#39;s this little thing called &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; that is absolutely essential. A great piano tuner is not necessarily a good musician, and memorizing the periodic table of the elements does not turn you into a chemist. Imagine a conversation with your mother: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure your father can fix the electronic ignition system in your Honda, dear…why, he managed to drive from Owatonna to the Mall of America last week, and he only got lost once!&amp;quot; One thing does not have anything to do with the other. Knowing a bunch of solid facts about stars does not justify explanations about magical influences that are antagonistic to known processes and which are built, not on the trustworthy foundation of that data, but on unfounded beliefs in magical influences from distant objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when that specialized scientific knowledge is used as part of the pseudo-scientific patter marshalled to justify their supernatural explanations. Science is window dressing to modern astrologers; they don&amp;#39;t get to fulminate indignantly by pointing at the astronomy element they&amp;#39;ve incorporated into their delusions when someone points out that their conclusions are all wrong and completely unwarranted. Those don&amp;#39;t matter. Their rationalizations are like &amp;#39;sophisticated theology&amp;#39; — vapor and noise that they make flashier by throwing in a few modern scientific terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebekah Higgitt wants to claim that astrologers are justified &amp;quot;if they are presented as idiots who don&amp;#39;t understand precession and do nothing but write newspaper horoscopes that cover around a twelfth of the population in one go.&amp;quot; OK. Then we should present them as idiots who don&amp;#39;t have a mechanism for their claimed influences, ignore all the logical arguments and empirical evidence that shows astrology doesn&amp;#39;t work, and abuse astronomy to put up a phony façade of scienciness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're still idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

This is especially likely to happen if I respond to that comment and end up writing a comment of myself that seems way too good to waste, forever buried in the comments where, as soon as the commenting on the post dies down, it remains, unread again. So it was after my post on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/the_integration_of_pseudoscience_into_me.php"&gt;the "integration" of quackery into academic medical centers&lt;/a&gt;. In that post, I applied some of my inimitable not-so-Respectful Insolence to a deal between Georgetown University, what should be a bastion of academia emphasizing science-based medicine, and Bastyr University, probably the most famous school of naturopathy in the United States. A commenter objected to my lumping naturopathy in with quackery like homeopathy and &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/the_integration_of_pseudoscience_into_me.php#comment-3169397"&gt;Quoth Kelly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bastyr has a good reputation. Do they embrace woo there? Sure, but they also don't force it on anyone, and they embrace the scientific method in their research and teaching.

&lt;p&gt;Lumping in naturopathy along with homeopathy, reiki, and so forth, just makes you look ignorant in the end. And that's a shame, especially since so much of medicine is moving forward to acknowledge that reductionism in medicine (and pharma, thanksomuch) is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside that this quote is self-contradictory (the part about admitting that Bastyr embraces woo but embraces the scientific method in research and teaching), it's also plain wrong. It demonstrates a fundamental ignorance of what naturopathy is. In fact, there is no woo that I've yet been able to find that naturopathy doesn't embrace. As an example, I thought I'd take a look at homeopathy and how naturopathy not only embraces it, but requires it. Let's start by looking at Bastyr University itself. Here is &lt;a href="http://bastyrcenter.org/content/category/4/147/161/"&gt;what the Bastyr University website says about homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;. First, it describes homeopathy as "natural" and "nontoxic" (the latter of which is hard to argue with, given that it's nothing more than water). Moreover, Bastyr even offers homeopathy services in its clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2007/11/coming_out.php"&gt;Came Out&lt;/a&gt;” in 2007, was “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/03/25/singled-out/"&gt;Singled Out&lt;/a&gt;” in 2009, and went “&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/07/19/under-the-microscope-feminism-scientists-and-sexiness/"&gt;Under The Microscope&lt;/a&gt;” in 2010, with lots of related posts in between. Each piece initially garnered an enormous response, high blog traffic, and echoed across the blogosphere–until a few days later when everyone seemed to forget and move on. The Internet has no memory after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can’t say I expected things would be any different when I proposed a panel entitled “&lt;em&gt;Perils of blogging as a woman under a real name&lt;/em&gt;” for Science Online 2011.  But two weeks later I’m wondering if maybe we’re reaching critical mass as attitudes are beginning to shift. As more of us stand up and speak out, &lt;a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=10073"&gt;transgressions become harder to ignore&lt;/a&gt;. If we raise awareness collectively, we shift cultural mores. And I’m encouraged that we’re moving in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the panel, a chorus emerged that has been rising in pitch. Posts have been composed about &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/fzTB1d"&gt;the challenges we face&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://professorkateclancy.blogspot.com/2011/01/science-online-2011-even-when-we-want.html"&gt;highlighting womens’ accomplishments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/observations/2011/01/ive_never_been_very_good_at_hi.php"&gt;acknowledging sexism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2011/01/hidden-women-hidden-writers.html"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;. Despite smaller ripples of the past, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/hey-you-men-who-yell-nice-tits-stfu/"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thehappyscientistblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/just-ask.html"&gt;feels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/drbecca/2011/01/25/self-promotion-tour-2011/"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href="http://bluelabcoats.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/linky-linky-blogging-and-doing-science-while-female/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/2011/01/let%E2%80%99s-talk-about-sex-in-science/"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/16/women-science-blogging"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://sarahaskew.net/2011/01/27/some-thoughts-a-poll-and-an-invitation/"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2011/01/sciencebloggrrrrl_power.php"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://gunsandelmo.tumblr.com/post/2941556951/for-her-skills-sure-i-would-love-to-be-rebecca"&gt;are &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2011/01/around_the_web_on_women_scienc.php"&gt;joining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/2011/01/why-scientists-should-blog/"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://biologyfiles.fieldofscience.com/2011/01/women-who-write-about-science.html"&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=woman-science-bloggers-discuss-pros-2011-01-18"&gt;fostering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://schoolingandeducation.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/afraid-of-men/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.denimandtweed.com/2011/01/we-need-to-hear-what-wed-rather-not.html"&gt;thoughtful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://seriousmonkeybusiness.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/raison-detre-of-the-female-undergraduate-primatology-blogger/"&gt;dialog&lt;/a&gt;.

In other words, he’s not promoting them &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are women, but rather because they are talented writers and scientists.

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I feel as if I’m not shouting against the wind alone anymore. Sure, this week’s enthusiasm will ebb at some point, but times are assuredly changing.  Along with the blogosphere. We still have a long way to go, but I’m optimistic at how far we’ve already come…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296228052418"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=50773">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e7bf1724168bebef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="dieting"/><category term="incentives"/><category term="obesity"/><category term="weight loss"/><title type="html">The Unintended Consequences of Government-Sponsored Weight-Loss Surgery</title><published>2011-01-28T14:32:49Z</published><updated>2011-01-28T14:32:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/vQBIvl5A__s/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/the-unintended-consequences-of-government-sponsored-weight-loss-surgery/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Here's how Darin McCloud, a 45-year-old man in Portsmouth, England, has been eating lately: "He has been scoffing three-quarters of a loaf of bread, several packets of crisps and bacon rolls every day, and tucking into chips, takeaways and junk food for his tea."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/vQBIvl5A__s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEPHEN J.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;I used to hate staying in my room. I used to hate sitting on my chair for hours, being unproductive and just dwindling my thumbs away.  I had to constantly walk about the house, which I still do…But I also hated the fact that I had such a small room and nothing was in my room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosey comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;I thought maybe "dwindling my thumbs away" was intentional misuse of "twiddling my thumbs", to conjure up images of this woman idly wearing her thumbs down to stumps. As I read on, I realised it wasn't intentional, so I checked for ghits. Variations of "dwindling my thumbs" (varying the verb and/or pronoun) show up to around 800 ghits. Other examples of "dwindling my thumbs away" (or variations thereof) don't really occur, but apparently a certain Russian lady is passing up the chance to dwindle her thumbs down:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;"You will forget about boredom with me! The palette of my interests looks like a rainbow sparkling with ideas, pursuits and aspirations. I am a self-made lady who enjoys daring challenges. That is why I like travelling and active sports: skiing, yachting, horse riding. I keep my mind opened to the world and am always ready to surf the wave of novelty and changes. Once I’ve completed the model career, I could just rest on the laurels and dwindle my thumbs down, but my everlasting longing for self-development and creation would never let me do so, thus I’ve taken up photography which is now one of the greatest passions of my life. Though I am extremely extravagant when it comes to friendship, warmth and care, I still keep a lot of love and tenderness in my heart for the man who will stand the closest of all to me. I am generous and sincere in my feelings and you’ll never feel forsaken even when I am going to be buzy."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other examples of thumb-dwindling seem to have been written by native speakers of English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;In a sluggish economy, travel can be expensive for one individual – not to mention the costs associated with families of three, four or more. The solution however, is not to spend all summer at home dwindling your thumbs - instead, get creative and search for cheap cruise deals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;These moderates (traitors in some vocabularies) believe in dwindling their thumbs and holding onto ideals of non-violence while Iraq is being invaded and torn apart again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Dwindling my thumbs until then.I'm heading to NYC tomorrow until Tuesday for one last trip before its time to go back to school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Forget tanking …. lets push for the playoff spot …. I think we could potentially end up at 5 or 6 if we stop tanking. That would give us some legit chance at getting a big free agent signing or use the TPE effectively. The team is always overlooked by others … so unless we get a good playoff standing we could be left dwindling our thumbs with all the extra cash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Why are some online casinos making a killing while others are left dwindling their thumbs not knowing how to attract players. These casinos with declining customer-base year after year don’t seem to realize that gambling enthusiasts are a smart lot and the only way to retain them is to offer quality with a big “Q!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;It leads one to wonder what humans actually accomplished between ancient Greece and the latter half of the 18th century- were we just dwindling our thumbs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility, of course, is that some people, confused by sound similarity and sound symbolism, have just analyzed &lt;em&gt;dwindle&lt;/em&gt; as meaning "twiddle" (in the relevant sense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given the examples of "dwindle away" or "dwindle down", there certainly do seem to be some people who have re-interpreted the (somewhat opaque) idiom "twiddle one's thumbs", meaning something like "to twirl or play with one's thumbs as a way of wasting time", as the (at least equally opaque) idiom "dwindle one's thumbs (down/away)", meaning something like "to wear out one's thumbs in idle play".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; contains &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/392.full"&gt;a short but comprehensive piece by Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; (free, I believe) on the latest findings in human evolution, including the second discovery of hybridization between archaic humans and “modern” &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;.  (This is &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/o-noes-another-species-of-human-in-eurasia/"&gt;the Denisova fossil&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote about recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do read Gibbons’s piece, as it’s a good way to get up to speed in 20 minutes or so.  She discusses the controversy about whether modern &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt; evolved “multiregionally,” transforming itself in many different places, or via replacement from a band that left Africa less than 100,000 years ago.  The hybridization data—Gibbons notes that up to 10%  of some modern human genomes came from mating with “archaic” ancestors—makes it impossible to clearly demarcate the two theories.  Gibbons ends her article by describing a wary &lt;em&gt;rapprochement&lt;/em&gt; between the two main advocates of those competing theories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Stringer and Wolpoff, both now in their 60s, their battle has  mellowed. Their views, while still distinct, have converged                         somewhat, and they shared a beer at a Neandertal  meeting last year. “The reason we get on well now,” says Stringer, “is  we                         both think we’ve been proved right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to discuss briefly a shorter second piece by Gibbons in the same issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/394.full"&gt;The species problem.&lt;/a&gt;“  Here she brings up the controversy about whether modern humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans were members of different species or the same species.   This question is far more important in dealing with humans than, say, with fruit flies, simply because there were far fewer types of hominins, and anthropologists’ careers depend on whether or not they name a new species.  That’s why there are so many species names in the hominin family tree—names that turn on characters as tiny as a few millimeters in the measurement of a tooth.  It’s likely that, several million years ago, three or four species of hominin &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; exist at the same time—and maybe at the same place—giving rise to fanciful scenarios about war and (especially) inter-group mating.  There’s nothing more salacious, in an evolutionary sense, than imagining a burly, hairy, and robust hominin male copulating with a female from a more modern-looking species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was more than a million years ago.  What about the more &lt;em&gt;modern&lt;/em&gt; groups of &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, like Neandertals?  According to Ernst Mayr’s biological species concept, which Gibbons describes, individuals are members of the same species if they can mate with each other when they encounter each other in nature, and, critically, &lt;em&gt;produce fertile, viable hybrids&lt;/em&gt;.  If they can’t, then there must exist genetic barriers to mixing of genes, the so-called “reproductive isolating barriers” that maintain the integrity of species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is some slack in how biologists use the definition, for hybridization of this type can range from being very rare (e.g., the medium and small Darwin’s ground finches, which hybridize at a rate of about 2%) to more pervasive (e.g., the black duck and mallard form hybrid swarms when they meet).   If there’s only a small amount of hybridization, and the species’ gene pools stay pretty separate, most biologists consider the case to involve different species (this is the situation in the Darwin’s finches I just mentioned).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of other points:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating&lt;/em&gt; between different groups is not enough to deem them conspecific: those matings have to produce viable and fertile hybrids.  And “viable and fertile” means not only that the hybrids can have offspring, but that they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have offspring in the wild.  Some interspecific hybrids in birds, for example, are viable and fertile, but are not recognized as proper mates by members of either parental species because those hybrids look weird or have strange mating behaviors.  That is a form of reproductive isolation, too: it’s analogous to sterility, but sterility on the grounds of not being attractive as a mate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, if one just sees hybrids in the wild, that’s not enough to claim that the parental groups must be members of the same species. Those hybrids have to constitute a genetic bridge between the parental groups; that is, they have to be fertile and mate with the parental species.  Often we simply don’t know this.  I believe Peter Grant once had a paper in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; noting that about 10% of bird species are known to form hybrids with closely-related species.  That’s been used to claim that hybridization is pervasive in birds, and that bird species might not be so “real” after all.  But that’s a wrong conclusion.  We simply don’t know anything about the fertility and viability (and sexual attractiveness!) of most of those hybrids.  And the hybrids have to occur in &lt;em&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt;, not in zoos or other artificial enclosures that might break down reproductive barriers that exist in nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons reports an opinion by Jean-Jacques Hublin, who works on human evolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the real world, [Hublin] says, Mayr’s concept                      doesn’t hold up: “There are about 330 closely  related species of mammals that interbreed, and at least a third of them  can                      produce fertile hybrids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast!  That 330 number means &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, since most of these produce sterile or inviable hybrids.  Too, how much of that “interbreeding” was observed in the wild versus zoos? (I don’t know the answer).  And only the cases seen&lt;em&gt; in nature&lt;/em&gt; count. Lions and tigers hybridize in zoos, producing fertile “ligers” and “tiglons”, but they didn’t hybridize when they once co-occurred in India. Zoos break down reproductive barriers: animals hybridize because they’re bored, horny, and there’s simply nothing else to mate with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we assume that 110 mammal species produce fertile and viable hybrids that interbreed with the parents in nature (that’s a generous estimate), this constitutes only 2.4% of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; mammal species (there are about 4500).  It’s misleading to claim that the biological species concept “doesn’t hold up” because it’s ambiguous at best 2.4% of the time. Think of all the other 97.6% of species where it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; ambiguous.  That’s the problem with using rare exceptions to invalidate a concept that works nearly all the time.  Beware of these “anecdotal horror stories,” as one biologist called them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don’t agree with Svante Pääbo, who is quoted by Gibbons as saying “I think discussion of what is a species and what is a subspecies is a sterile academic endeavor.”  This may be true when arguing about human fossils in the past, or in a single lineage, but is not &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; true in sexually-reproducing plants and animals.  As I’ve noted before, species are real, objectively delineated entities in nature, and discussing why they are distinct, and how to diagnose them, is hardly a sterile exercise.  Species are not arbitrary divisions of an organic continuum.  In sexually reproducing taxa they form distinct groups, well separated in “morphospace” and “genospace.”  We need to understand why that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, it’s dubious to define species based on the degree of morphological difference between them.  As Gibbons notes, “There’s also no agreed-upon yardstick for how much morphologic or genetic difference separates species.”  She’s absolutely right—to settle on such a yardstick is to make an arbitrary decision.  The black duck and mallard, for example, look pretty different, but are probably members of the same species.  If two species of geographically isolated birds were as different in appearance from each other as, say, Asians and Sudanese humans, they’d be called different species. Yet we don’t think of human “races” as different species because, despite their different appearances, they crossbreed easily and form mixed populations when they encounter each other.  Morphological (and genetic) differences are often a poor key to species status, particularly when we’re so attuned to small differences, as is the case in human fossils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about “modern” &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, Neandertals, and Denisovans?  Clearly they hybridized, and some of the hybrids were fertile, for traces of Denisovan and Neandertal genes remain in our genomes.  On this basis, anthropologist John Hawks deems Neandertals, modern humans, and Denisovans members of the same species; Gibbons quotes him as saying “They mated with each other.  We’ll call them the same species.”  (I hope by “mating” he means “mated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; produced fertile offspring”.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little bit of gene flow isn’t enough to convince most of us that these groups were conspecific. On that basis, the Darwin’s finches would be deemed conspecific, but nobody does that.  The question is whether that gene flow reflected lack of opportunity for mating (in which case they might be the same species), or pervasive hybridization (between, say, modern humans and Neandertals) but only weak viability or fertility of the “hybrids” (in which case they’d be different species).   We will probably never know the answer to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this make the species status of these three groups purely arbitrary?  I don’t think so. What we can do is get a “yardstick” by seeing whether other species of primates that were separated for as long as Neandertals, Denisovans, and modern humans—roughly half a million years—have evolved into reproductively isolated groups.  I’m not sure what the answer is (it’s probably sitting there somewhere in the literature), but I’d guess that they &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be separate species, especially because humans have much longer generation times than other primates and so would speciate even more slowly.  If it were my call, I’d agree with Hawks (but for somewhat different reasons), calling Neandertals, Denisovans, and modern humans all members of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for the hobbits, &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;, I’d stick with calling them a different species.  They diverged from modern &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens &lt;/em&gt;much further in the past, although they may have been contemporaneous with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paleoclimate:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6016/450.short"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; by Spielhagen and co-authors in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; reconstructs temperatures of North Atlantic source waters to the Arctic for the past two millennia, adding another very long-handled &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2011/01/27/science-temperatures-atlantic-water-arctic-unprecedented-2000-years-linked-to-arctic-amplification-of-global-warming/"&gt;Hockey Stick&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/09/progress-in-millennial-reconstructions/"&gt;ever-growing&lt;/a&gt; league.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. From last week, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/01/12/science.1197175.abstract"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Express&lt;/em&gt; by Buntgen &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; reconstructing European summer temperature for the past 2500 years, finding that recent warming is unprecedented over that time frame, and providing some historical insights into the societal challenges posed by climate instability (listen &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/22/133143758/could-climate-change-have-led-to-the-fall-of-rome"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an interview with mike about the study on NPR’s &lt;em&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The team of ice core researchers at WAIS Divide &lt;a href="http://waisdivide.unh.edu/news/index.shtml#201"&gt;reaches its goal&lt;/a&gt; of 3300 meters of ice.  [WAIS Divide, central West Antarctica, is a site of significant warming in Antarctica, over at least the last 50 years, a result recently confirmed by the study of &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/12/a-brief-history-of-knowledge-about-antarctic-temperatures/"&gt;O'Donnell et al. (2010)&lt;/a&gt;; Stay tuned for more on the that soon].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Miscellaneous Items:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. More in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7330/full/469293a.html"&gt;data sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. A great primer in &lt;em&gt;Physics Today&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="http://ptonline.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;amp;id=PHTOAD000064000001000033000001&amp;amp;idtype=cvips&amp;amp;gifs=Yes&amp;amp;ref=no"&gt;planetary energy balance&lt;/a&gt; from our very own Ray Pierrehumbert (link to pdf available &lt;a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~rtp1/papers/PhysTodayRT2011.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

The main picture is divided into a gazillion little squares, and each one of those squares is another picture. It’s pretty cool; from a distance the picture looks fine, then up close you can see all the little pictures making it up&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what I mean? Then check out &lt;a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/national-parks/infinite-photo/"&gt;this awesome interactive National Park picture&lt;/a&gt; put up by National Geographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to that site you see this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yellow square defines a &amp;quot;region of interest&amp;quot; which you can move around. When clicked, you get a zoom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2011/01/natgeo_infinity2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="502"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coooool. Technically, you can keep on doing that forever, but in this case it drops a few levels and then you get a description of one of the component pictures. &lt;/p&gt;

The call started this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The field of phonetics has experienced two revolutions in the last century: the advent of the sound spectrograph in the 1950s and the application of computers beginning in the 1970s. Today, advances in computation, networking and mass storage are promising a third revolution: a movement from the study of small, mostly artificial datasets to the analysis of published corpora of natural speech that are thousands of times larger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response has been excellent, as you can see from the &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonetics/workshop/program.html"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;. I'll report here, as time permits, on some of the presentations that seem likely to be of interest to a general audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last day of the workshop will focus on a topic that is potentially of great importance, in my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The last day of the workshop (January 31) is for those interested in discussing development of tools suitable for teaching acoustic-phonetic analysis to beginners while allowing smooth progression to efficient advanced research protocols. The aim is to capitalize on the strengths of existing freeware systems, losing none of their capabilities, while providing as unified a platform as possible for future development. Questions to be addressed include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;* &lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;What free or low-cost software is currently available?&lt;br&gt;
* Of competing systems or platforms, which is best for what purpose, and why?&lt;br&gt;
* How can currently available platforms be adapted to preserve the best of each and minimize disruption for currently expert users who want to exploit the new integrated platform? (i.e. what is needed to develop an interface between the new and existing platforms?)&lt;br&gt;
* What capabilities might be most conducive to flexibility and efficiency for users?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already many excellent tools for specialists and would-be specialists — &lt;a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/"&gt;Praat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lat-mpi.eu/tools/elan/"&gt;Elan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wavesurfer/"&gt;Wavesurfer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.exmaralda.org/"&gt;EXMARARaLDA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/"&gt;Festival&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://trans.sourceforge.net/en/presentation.php"&gt;Transcriber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://emu.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Emu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;HTK&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phonetics/p2fa/index.html"&gt;Penn Forced Aligner&lt;/a&gt;, etc. — as well as tools aimed at a broader audience, like &lt;a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Sox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;.  Even for experts, there are some things missing, and of course many things that could and should (and will) be improved); but the biggest gap between reality and opportunity is in the area of tools for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason today why interested middle-school students shouldn&amp;#39;t know how to do basic audio analysis and editing — I can testify from personal experience that some of them do, especially when they&amp;#39;re motivated by creating music. In middle school and high school, there are wonderful opportunities to use such techniques not only for teaching some basic concepts in applied linguistic phonetics, but also aspects of other fields, from  physics (e.g. period, wavelength, frequency), to music (pitch, intervals, timbre, timing), anthropology (accent differences and the response to them), and psychology (just noticeable differences, psychometric response functions, …). There are also clear creative opportunities in rhetoric, drama, oral literature, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At higher levels, would-be teachers should learn such things at least at a basic level, and of course people in areas like speech therapy and speech pathology have a special need for these concepts and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call focuses on tools, but obviously curricula that use the tools are at least as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that Monday's discussions will sharpen ideas about the opportunities, and reinforce efforts to take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note that this is not a call for participation, as the workshop will already be near the rated capacity of the available rooms, unless the recent snow storm takes a more serious toll than we now anticipate. If you happen to be in the area and want to attend, we can probably shoe-horn you in; but for others, we'll make the slides, posters, and other materials from the workshop available as soon as possible.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296220627433"><id gr:original-id="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2768">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7868266f2094acc0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Polypharmacy</title><published>2011-01-28T12:58:31Z</published><updated>2011-01-28T12:58:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2768" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;To quote a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;very popular science blogger&lt;/a&gt;, “I get e-mail.” I wish I could respond to every one, but there is just not enough time in the day. I do read every e-mail – it is a great source of feedback and ideas. I especially enjoy responding to e-mails that are criticizing my position on something or that defend a position I do not agree with. Responding to specific arguments is a good way to organize an essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also look for patterns in the e-mails (and in other venues) – arguments that tend to occur over and over again. Clearly there is something compelling about such arguments, or their “meme” is in the popular culture or at least within a certain subculture. I give high priority to responding to those questions that I see frequently, that are representative of a common belief. Here is one such e-mail about doctors prescribing drugs (unedited):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;could you please comment on why MD,s now proscribe reams of “take another  pill” and never say “let us fix this” when you visit your MD you always leave with another drug, as a former MD  of mine said it is better to drive under a 18 wheeler, than to stop taking these pills.  an 18 wheeler will only hurt you ,stop taking these pills and will DIE.  UNLESS  i am the only dead person with an email address i am NOT dead. we need more MD,s who will accept the fact that natural is many times as  good as, if not better than a bunch of money grubing DOCTORS who see $ signs not  patient welfare&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;david&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few themes in this e-mail that are very typical anti-science-based medicine propaganda, and a kernel of a legitimate concern. The concern is over polypharmacy (combing different drugs) and overprescribing (giving patients too many, inappropriate, or bad combinations of drugs). The e-mail states this issue in a rather propagandistic style, combined with a false dichotomy – prescribing medication vs fixing the problem. Medications have many different purposes in medicine. Sometimes they are curative, like antibiotics for a bacterial infection – and so are a way to fix the problem. Sometimes they are preventive, like aspirin for preventing strokes and heart attacks. In such cases medications can prevent or at least reduce the risk of serious disease. Ironically I often hear people advocate preventive medicine instead of medicine, not realizing that in many cases medications are effective preventives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medication can also be symptomatic – meant to reduce symptoms, but not necessarily alter the course of the disease or prevent complications. Again, it is a common theme among medicine critics to criticize “just treating the symptoms.” This is also a false dichotomy – you can simultaneously give curative, preventive, and symptomatic treatments. And symptomatic treatments should not be dismissed. Ask anyone with an incurable chronic pain syndrome how symptomatic therapy has affected their quality of life. The notion that symptomatic treatment should not be given instead of disease-altering treatment, and using powerful symptomatic drugs to mask the symptoms of a serious illness, and therefore complicate the ability to follow the course of that illness, is a basic concept taught to every medical student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is further true that pharmacological treatment is just one medical modality, and others should not be neglected. Physicians should (and often do) encourage lifestyle changes – such as a healthful diet and regular exercise – to prevent disease and promote health. But this is often not adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-pharmacological (and non-surgical) interventions are well integrated into standard medical care. I routinely prescribe specific vitamins for specific conditions, refer patients for physical therapy for chronic pain and other ailments, review lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, sleep, and substance use, and counsel patients to use moist heat,  wrist braces or other conservative modalities to treat common problems. And no, I am not the exception – these are all accepted standard practices. The cartoon picture of the average physician as a greedy pill pusher is just propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, there is a bell curve of competence among physicians. Some physicians do overprescribe or neglect non-pharmacological interventions. But that’s not the standard of care, nor is it typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overprescribing is also an issue that the medical community wrestles with themselves. There are many studies and articles discussing this issue – which is often complex and requires an evidence-based and balanced approach. There are specific areas in which a lot of introspection, research, and quality control has been done – like overprescribing antibiotics for viral infections, or hypnotics in the elderly. This is mainly a quality-control issue – getting the word out to practicing physicians so that they follow the best evidence-based guidelines. I do think we need to do a better job here, but it’s important to recognize what the problem is. It is not with philosophy, or in many cases even evidence – but rather with physician education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “greedy” doctors argument is a non-sequitur. Doctors do not get paid for prescribing drugs. Kickbacks for doing so is actually illegal and unethical. Doctors generally bill for their time, or for specific procedures – not prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final very common argument that the e-mailer puts forward is that “natural” interventions are better than medicine. This is simply the naturalistic fallacy. There is no useful definition of “natural”, nor is there any reason to think that a natural remedy is safer or more effective than a manufactured one. Many herbal products sold as natural alternatives, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6"&gt;are just drugs themselves&lt;/a&gt; – unpurified and poorly controlled drugs – but make no mistake, they are drugs, with all the pharmacological activity of regulated drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the issue of polypharmacy is a real one, it is a complex issue that is being addressed within the medical community, including the relationship of doctors with the pharmaceutical industry and their promotional activities. But we do need to move beyond the simplistic propaganda-style arguments used by the e-mailer. Unfortunately, that is the general level of the conversation in the public, which is a shame. There are many legitimate issues that can and should be addressed in the public forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of motive, Zach was glad to take them up on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was invited by Heath Hill to speak with him during the Sunday School class he teaches at Lakepointe Church in Rockwall, Texas.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s really surprising to me is that Hill owns the advertising company whose ‘I Still Love You — God” truck &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/12/16/fort-worth-transit-authority-now-bans-religious-and-non-religious-ads/"&gt;followed Fort Worth buses&lt;/a&gt; carrying the “Good Without God” ads a couple months ago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve said this before and a lot of you disagree, but I like these sorts of gestures from churches, where the aim is to &lt;em&gt;converse&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;convert&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the Christians learn anything from Zach?  Who knows.  But if you have a chance to address your message to the very people who need to hear it the most, why wouldn’t you take that opportunity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t had a chance to watch this whole exchange, but if there are any parts you feel we should see, please let us know the timestamps in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

I am a clinician, taking care of patients with infectious diseases at several hospitals in the Portland area. I am not part of an academic center (although we are affiliated with OHSU and have a medicine residency program). I have not done any research since I was a fellow, 20 years ago. I was an excellent example of the Peter Principal; there was no bench experiment that I could not screw up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My principal weapon in patient care is the medical literature, accessed throughout the day thanks to Google and &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;. The medical literature is enormous. There are more than 21,000,000 articles referenced on Pubmed, over a million if the search term ‘infection’ is used, with 45,000 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably read as much of the ID literature as any specialist. Preparing for my &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/persiflagers-infectious-disease/id79930757"&gt;Puscast podcast&lt;/a&gt;, I skim several hundred titles every two weeks, usually select around 80 references of interest and read most of them with varying degrees of depth. Yet I am still sipping at a fire hose of information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old definition of a specialist is someone who knows more and more about less and less until they everything about nothing. I often feel I know less and less about more and more until someday I will know nothing about everything. Yet I am considered knowledgeable by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), who wasted huge amounts of my time, a serious chunk of my cash, and who have declared, after years of testing, that I am recertified in my specialty. I am still Board Certified, but the nearly pointless exercise has left me certified bored. But I can rant for hours on Bored Certification and how out of touch with the practice of medicine the ABIM is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concept of an expert is a combination of experience and understanding of the literature. I used to say mastery of the literature, but no one can master a beast that large; I am just riding on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld_(world)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great A’Tuin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of medical writings. Experience comes with time, and I have read that it takes 10 years to become competent in a field. Whether true or not, it matches my experience. I remember as a resident reading notes on patients I had cared for as an intern, and being appalled with what an ignorant dufus I was. In my first year of practice I had a patient who died of miliary tuberculosis, and the diagnosis was, unfortunately, made at autopsy. It was an atypical manifestation of a rare (in the US) disease. About a decade later the case was presented as an unknown to a visiting professor; I had completely forgotten the case, but I piped up from the audience to pontificate on how this had to be miliary Tb. Afterwards I was shown the chart and nice documentation as to how clueless I had been a decade earlier. When it comes to being a diagnostician, there is not substitute for experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to treatment? That is where I tell the residents that the three most dangerous words in medicine are ‘In. My. Experience.’ You cannot trust experience when deciding on therapy, especially for relatively unusual diseases. Sometimes I will ask a doc why they use a given antibiotic, usually in a situation where it is being used in a way that is, shall we say, old fashioned. Often the response is “I like it”‘ as if the choice of a drug is like choosing a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rely on the literature — such as it is, and limited by my lack of an Ethernet jack in my brain — in deciding the best course of therapy for a patient. The literature is always unsatisfactory. That has always been known. Even with the best studies, there is always the issue of wondering if the literature applies to your patient and their particular co-morbidities, and, perhaps, genetics. As an example, it is becoming evident that the literature on the presentation and treatment of &lt;em&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on the experience with &lt;em&gt;C. neoformans&lt;/em&gt;, is not applicable to &lt;em&gt;C. gattii&lt;/em&gt;, a new strain of the fungus in the NW. So how to use a literature that may not be totally relevant to my local conditions? I wing it. It is an educated and experienced winging, but winging it I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the breadth and depth of the literature, it is nice to have systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and guidelines. As a practicing physician, I find them helpful as they provide an overarching understanding, a conceptual framework, for understanding a disease or a treatment. They are the Reader’s Digest abridged version of a topic, and the references are invaluable.  Usually most of the relevant literature is collected in these reviews and make it easier, especially in the era of the Googles and on-line references, to find the original literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three have their flaws, and if you are well versed in a field, you recognize the issues and try and compensate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was noted in the &lt;a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/171/1/18"&gt;recent Archives&lt;/a&gt;, the literature to support the recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society America are not necessarily based on the best of evidence. Really? I’m shocked. Next up, water is wet, fire is hot, and the Archives confirms the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results In the 41 analyzed guidelines, 4218 individual recommendations were found and tabulated. Fourteen percent of the recommendations were classified as level I, 31% as level II, and 55% as level III evidence. Among class A recommendations (good evidence for support), 23% were level I (1 randomized controlled trial) and 37% were based on expert opinion only (level III). Updated guidelines expanded the absolute number of individual recommendations substantially. However, few were due to a sizable increase in level I evidence; most additional recommendations had level II and III evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: More than half of the current recommendations of the IDSA are based on level III evidence only. Until more data from well-designed controlled clinical trials become available, physicians should remain cautious when using current guidelines as the sole source guiding patient care decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big duh. Anyone who is a specialist understands the weaknesses in all guidelines, but we also understand their importance. When I was a fellow, one of my attending was, and still is, one of the foremost experts in the US on &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;, and anothers areas of expertise is &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; infections and endocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both have spent a career thinking deeply on their respective areas of expertise. You learn that while no one is perfect, the breadth and depth of their knowledge and experience gives their recommendations extra weight. Who would you want at the controls of your plane in a unexpected and unusual weather conditions? An experienced pilot, or someone who spent a few days on the X-Plane simulator? The same with all the guidelines. When someone with a lifetimes of work in a field helps write a guideline, you pay attention to their expertise. You know the recommendations are not necessarily right, but odds are their opinions are better than mine, just as my opinion is usually better than a hospitalist, as least as far as infections are concerned. With residents, I try make a point of differentiating when my recommendation is no better than the next doc, and when my recommendation is the Truth, big T, and based on the best understanding of the literature at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attitude, trusting authority, held by many in medicine, goes against the University of Google approach where a day of searching and a quick misreading of the abstracts renders everyone an expert. I wonder if other fields are plagued with these quick pseudo-experts. Law is, when the accused attempt to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly would be in favor of more money being spent on infectious disease research, and, one hopes, infectious disease doctors. In a perfect world, every disease would be subjected to careful, extensive clinical trials and I would know, for example, the best therapy for invasive &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia in a neutropenic leukemia patient. Until that time, I am, in part, going to rely on the guidelines written by those who have spent a career thinking about the diseases I have to treat. To &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/735511"&gt;quote Dr Powers&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guidelines may provide a starting point for searching for information, but they are not the finish line…Evaluating evidence is about assessing probability,” Dr. Powers commented in a news release. “Perhaps the main point we should take from the studies on quality of evidence is to be wary of falling into the trap of ‘cookbook medicine,’” Dr. Powers continues. “Although the evidence and recommendations in guidelines may change across time, providers will always have a need to know how to think about clinical problems, not just what to think.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was struck by a recent &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/736131?sssdmh=dm1.661611&amp;amp;src=nldne"&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt; headline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cochrane Review Stirs Controversy Over Statins in Primary Prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been irritated of late by Cochrane reviews in my area of expertise, I clicked the link.  The first three paragraphs are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new Cochrane review has provoked controversy by concluding that there is not enough evidence to recommend the widespread use of statins in the primary prevention of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the new Cochrane meta-analysis, led by Dr Fiona Taylor (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK), issued a press release questioning the benefit of statins in primary prevention and suggesting that the previous data showing benefit may have been biased by industry-funded studies. This has led to headlines in many UK newspapers saying that the drugs are being overused and that millions of people are needlessly exposing themselves to potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has angered researchers who have conducted other large statin meta-analyses, who say the drugs are beneficial, even in the lowest-risk individuals, and their risk of side effects is negligible. They maintain that the Cochrane reviewers have misrepresented the data, which they say could have serious negative consequences for many patients currently taking these agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; both refer to the Cochrane review as a “study.” A review is not what I would consider a study, usually synonymous with a clinical trial. The use of the term makes it sound like the Cochrane folks were doing a clinical trial, patients being randomized to one treatment or another. My sloppy non scientific poll of people (all people in the medical field, but that is who I have contact with) suggests the no one considers a review of clinical trials to be a study. A review of a novel is not the same as writing a novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sloppy and potentially misleading language from major news outlets. What a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always liked meta-analysis for the same reason I like guidelines: they provide an overarching conceptual framework for understanding a topic. But only a fool would make clinical decisions based upon a meta-analysis. Yet, meta-analysis seem to be creeping to the top of the list of the clinical information rankings to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are issues with meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies included in a meta-analysis are often of suboptimal quality. Many spend time bemoaning the lack of quality studies they are about to stuff into their study grinder. Then, despite knowing that the input is poor quality, the go ahead and make a sausage. The theory, as I said last week, is that if you collect many individual cow pies into one big pile, the manure transmogrifies into gold. I still think it as a case of GIGO: Garbage In, Garbage Out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has always been my understanding that a meta-analysis was used in lieu of a quality clinical trial. Once you had a few high quality studies, you could ignore the conclusions of a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluations of the validity of the conclusions of meta-analysis have demonstrated that the results of a meta-analysis usually fail to predict the results of future good clinical trials. The &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html"&gt;JREF million&lt;/a&gt; is safe from the Cochrane, I suppose. Their conclusions are &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199708213370806"&gt;no more reliable&lt;/a&gt; than the studies they collect and are no more valid than the rest of the medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 12 large randomized, controlled trials and 19 meta-analyses addressing the same questions. For a total of 40 primary and secondary outcomes, agreement between the meta-analyses and the large clinical trials was only fair (kappa= 0.35; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.06 to 0.64). The positive predictive value of the meta-analyses was 68 percent, and the negative predictive value 67 percent. However, the difference in point estimates between the randomized trials and the meta-analyses was statistically significant for only 5 of the 40 comparisons (12 percent). Furthermore, in each case of disagreement a statistically significant effect of treatment was found by one method, whereas no statistically significant effect was found by the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there was a quality definitive trial or three, the meta-analysis becomes, I thought, moot. A quality clinical trial trumps the meta. I guess. I am not so certain that is the attitude anymore given the freak-out in the media about Cochrane and statins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the producers of meta-analysis have characteristics like the March of Dimes. Polio was conquered, but rather than folding up their tents and stealing away, they continue to march. That may be a good thing too, as there could be a polio resurgence if some anti-vaccine wackaloons have their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a definitive trial, rather than declaring the question settled, the new, perhaps higher-quality, study is folded in with the prior studies and a new meta-analysis is generated. But newer studies are diluted by the older, less robust trials, so the more reliable results are lost in the wash. The best drowned in a sea of mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I see no need for a meta-analysis on the efficacy of Echinacea. The last several trials, combined with basic science/prior probability, provides sufficient evidence to conclude Echinacea does not work. Good trials win. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a practicing specialist, no matter how much I read, I rely in part on guidelines, meta-analyses and systematic reviews as nice overviews to be used as flawed stopgaps awaiting large high quality clinical trials, that, like Godot, may never come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sick patients who need treatment. I need to know what to do. I have to fight the battles with the weapons I have. I have the medical literature and I am not afraid to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

Marquesan tattooing (rear), by Von de Steinen.

I’ve often given anthropological colleagues advice that could have been taken verbatim from my stints in sales school — they would probably be mortified if I knew about the dual purposing.  At times, I worry about my colleagues because I think that a whole series of situations in academia actually resemble sales situations: job interviewing, ‘open day’ for prospective students, grant writing, and even the first few lectures in an introductory class, when you’d be well served if you could persuade the assembled students that you’ve got something to say worth hearing.   

Anthropologists sometimes don’t seem terribly good at selling what they do. If you couldn’t convince a starving man to eat a sandwich, how can we persuade diverse audiences to pay attention to anthropology?

After my previous post on the ‘Vital topics forum,’ reader Jason Antrosio asked my opinion about Ulf Hannerz’s article from the same American Anthropologist: ‘Diversity is Our Business.’  Since I had been banging on about anthropology promoting itself as the study of human diversity, Jason probably assumed, quite reasonably, that I had already read Hannerz’s piece.  Alas, I hadn’t.  One of the many downsides of being laid up at home is that I only read the forum online and hadn’t really browsed the contents of the latest AA because my hard copy is likely still sitting in my office mailbox.

Hannerz’s piece, ‘Diversity is Our Business,’ is well worth the read not just because he explores how the field is misrepresented in the public eye; Hannerz asks what we might do as a field to counter-act anthro-bashing.  He wades into water that I prefer to plunge into neck deep here: what kind of brand is ‘Anthropology,’ how do we tell people about what we do, and do we need to perform a bit of brand management? 

Perhaps provocatively, in drawing on a characteristic current vocabulary, I would argue that anthropology needs to cultivate a strong brand. Those who feel ill at ease with that term, thinking that in its crassness it sullies their noble scholarly pursuits, can perhaps just as well continue to call it “public image” or even just “identity,” but in times of not just neoliberal thought but also of media saturation and short attention spans, it may be that “brand” is a useful root metaphor, a word to think with in the world we live in. (These days, too, not only corporations or consumer goods are linked to brands but also for example cities and countries.) Brands should attract outsiders: customers, visitors, members of the public. At the same time, they should preferably offer a fully acceptable identity for whoever may count as insiders to reflect on and be inspired by. (Hannerz 2010: 543)

Hell, yeah, we should think about Anthropology as a brand! With no trace of irony, I’d argue that we get serious about our collective self-promotion as a discipline.  Hannerz gets off to a good start, but I think we could even step up the campaign a bit, making use of the traditional strengths of our discipline to promote our intellectual and research potential.  And I’m going to take this opportunity, as well, to reply to some of the issues Daniel outlined in his piece, Anthropology and Publicity, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while.

Anthropology bashing

Hannerz begins his discussion with a reflection on Pres. Barack Obama’s use of ‘anthropological’ to describe when, during his campaign, Obama apologized for sounding out of touch.  Obama said he was sorry that he sounded as if he was ‘talking to a bunch of wine-sipping San Francisco liberals with an anthropological view toward white working-class voters.’ As Hannerz explains, Obama’s assumptions embedded in this apology grate for anthropologists because he takes for granted a public stereotype so at odds with our self-conception (and so ironic given that Obama’s late mother was an anthropologist):

Here it seems to me, then, that the candidate Obama assigns a stereotypically distant view, lacking in empathy, to anthropology—and then proceeds to sketch, as its opposite, precisely the sort of close, contextualizing understanding that we as anthropologists are much more likely to claim for ourselves. And from this particular source, we may find the stereotype so much more surprising because we might have thought this candidate should have got his anthropology right—but more about that later. In any case, here is an instance of a recurrent phenomenon that we might call “anthropology bashing.”  (Hannerz 2010: 541)

According to Hannerz, ‘anthropology bashing’ comes in four basic flavours:

Anthropologists are portrayed as cold and distant observers, ‘at worst, as someone who uses his skills to manipulate situations in ways which are detrimental to the human beings about which he has built up an expertise’ (Hannerz 2010: 541).  This image is of the ‘handmaiden’ of colonialism, a superior-feeling expert at manipulating natives, depriving them of their patrimony, and speaking in place of the cultures that we study.

Anthropologists, in contradiction, are depicted as ‘bumbling, incompetent observer who does not get even obvious realities right,’ as Hannerz puts it, less capable of ‘getting it’ than locals or even amateur observers.  This image is the anthropologist as dowdy professor-type who is ill-suited for life beyond the Ivory Tower but utterly oblivious to this fact.

As part of academia, Hannerz also worries that we are ‘easy target for a kind of populism that proclaims that research in and about far-away places is useless and that money devoted to it is therefore not well-spent.’  Here, Hannerz suggests that anthropologists are particularly prone to populist abuse, such as the ‘Golden Fleece Awards’ given by US Senator William Proxmire, often to projects that receive federal funding but have the bad luck to possess titles that Sen. Proxmire finds easy to mock.

Finally, Hannerz argues that anthropologists are bashed as being anachronistic and slightly out of date, pictured in pith helmets and safari suits with a mirthful chuckle that our field even still exists.  Ironically, I believe that one of the senior administrators at my own university had a giggle at our expense for this very reason, as if it was comical to think that anthropologists still were out there, wandering around, doing this funny old anthropology thing we do.

I could fiddle with this classification, but I think the list is quite good on the whole and demonstrates the key problem: not a single critique, but a lack of control over how we are perceived. Anthropologists need to invest more in getting our version of what we do before the public eye rather than let ourselves be defined by others.

If we look closer, what we find in a lot of the critiques are caricatures of us put forward by other people: indigenous ‘advocates’ who attack anthropologists, cultural studies scholars who try to make game of us, and the out-of-touch who assume that, if they don’t know what’s happening, there must not be anything happening in our field.  We often don’t take strong stands against these caricatures, or we take nuanced opposition to them that doesn’t do much to abate the more powerful rhetorical thrust of the criticism.

For example, when criticized for being complicit in colonialism, most cultural anthropologists will tend to roll over and go along with the criticism, conceding that, in fact, anthropologists have given indirect assistance and even philosophical justification for colonialism.  I think that this is a losing strategy in the public sphere.

Cui Yin Mok at the Open Anthropology Cooperative similarly argues that anthropologists have sort of lost their mojo as they’re going too self-critical ‘baggage’ that stops them from better describing their field to the public.

Somehow we got on the topic of admissions, where we all admitted, jokingly, to feeling like impostors. Then the white female student stated that she didn't believe in affirmative action, and expressed her view with quite a bit of anger. "Besides," she finished, "I just don't see race."I was completely paralyzed, and felt like I had no way to articulate what was wrong with what she just said. She happened to leave the room shortly after her statement. I turned to my Asian-American friend."Doesn't see race?" She almost shouted. Tears sprang to her eyes. "When she says that, she doesn't see ME." I looked at her, mute, wanting to cry myself for the shame of not knowing how to be a better friend.* * *I haven't always been the best ally. At times, I probably haven't been an ally at all. The story I related above was the only one I dared share where I could sufficiently pseudonymize the characters. It was not the first, nor was it the last, time I was struck dumb by racism.I did learn to speak up and interrupt racism, and slowly have figured out ways to make the elimination of racism and sexism priorities in my life. But I have a long way to go.The MLK, Jr Memorial panel at Science Online 2011, like the women scienceblogging panel, was up against some stiff competition: Defending Science Online, Standing out: Marketing yourself in science, Blogging networks and the emerging science communications ecosystem and Not All Marketing is Evil: Getting Life Science Companies to Support Science Online. I'll admit to sitting near the back with the thought I might divide my time between this session and one other. Yet within the first few minutes I sat there, I knew I was in the right place. David Kroll, who you know all over the internet because of his great blogs Terra Sigillata and Take as Directed, opened by playing the guitar and singing Bob Marley. Within a few bars, about a third of the audience was singing along with him. I was too busy trying not to cry to join in.I was emotional for a number of reasons... because of the wonderful contradiction of David sitting up there and singing, because of the warmth of the room, where it felt like we had a shared mission. David contradicted the paralysis a lot of allies face, because we are so afraid of doing it wrong, of making the mistake that exposes the racism and privilege we are working so hard to cover up.In addition to discussing Martin Luther King, Jr's history in Durham and the surrounding area, David shared with us the following quote from Irving Epstein (which it turns out David wrote about a year ago here):In 2005, more than two-thirds of the American scientific workforce was composed of white males. But by 2050, white males will make up less than one-fourth of the population. If the pipeline fails to produce qualified nonwhite scientists, we will, in effect, be competing against the rest of the world with one hand tied behind our backs.Danielle Lee of Urban Science Adventures, and Alberto Roca of Minority Postdoc, were also panelists. Danielle was engaging and smart: she talked about issues of underrepresentation in science, as well as access and trust of science in minority communities. Alberto, who I had also heard speak as an audience member at a few other panels, also talked about underrepresentation issues in science, the invisibility and isolation of being a person of color in science, and how to operate against that isolation. Here are a few of their broader points (any butchered or incomplete thoughts are my fault only):People of color and from underrepresented groups often have to pass in order to survive in science.People have to be mentored all the way up the chain: several stories were mentioned where women and people of color were not adequately prepared or professionalized for their jobs and suffered for it.Impostor syndrome is universal.You act like a role model when you have a voice, so if you aren't speaking up you aren't a role model. Also, if you are invisible or are ignored/underappreciated, you will have a harder time being an effective role model. So the knife cuts both ways.As Danielle says, science needs a new PR campaign. The African American community has serious trust issues with science and with good reason: this community has been exploited, undervalued, ignored.Related to the above, there was some discussion of issues of religion and science; namely, that it is a mistake to completely discount or scoff at those with religion. Religion, faith, and religious practices have an important cultural component for many minority communities in the United States and beyond, and to write off their beliefs is to write them off as people. Even if that's not what is intended, that is certainly what is heard.The entire session was moving -- all three panelists were so thoughtful and kind to one another, they answered audience questions so well, and the audience was committed to the issue of underrepresentation in science.  I have a few last thoughts of my own that I'd like to share, as a way to extend the conversation about women scienceblogging to be more inclusive.First, I don't think white people or people with privilege should shy away from conversations about underrepresentation, race, or ethnicity. It is time to just be comfortable with the fact that we are going to make mistakes. If we are well-meaning and want to eliminate racism and other oppressions, then the mistakes we are going to make will not be as bad as the worst ones faced by those to whom we're trying to be allies. Those of us in this community who are academics tend to encourage our students to make mistakes, because we know they will learn from them. But the stakes feel so high in this situation that we are paralyzed. Guess what? Being paralyzed is actually worse than making a mistake. You can apologize for a mistake. There isn't much you can do to fix things if you stay out of an important fight.Second, you know the isolation we talk about as women scientists and science writers? Multiply that times a million and you probably have the isolation of being a person of color in the sciences. There are some different ways in which sexism and racism play out in the public sphere, at least in the US: people might be a bit more willing to make sexist comments than racist ones. However, the impact of racism is at least as harmful, probably more harmful in most ways, because it leads to social disparities in education, health, salaries, living conditions.   There are people out there who study the effects of social disparities and internalized racism on health, and folks, it's not good. For instance, the mortality rates of blacks are significantly higher than for whites in heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, flu and pneumonia, HIV, cirrhosis and homicide (Williams 1999). Measures of internalized racism are correlated with a higher waist circumference, abdominal obesity and insulin resistance (Tull et al 1999, Chambers et al 2004). Issues of acculturation plague immigrant women, especially second-generation women, who experience more explicit instances of racism in their lives through acculturation (Viruell-Fuentes 2007).Finally, science will be a richer, more interesting topic when there is more diversity. And I don't just mean it in the Small World sense: I mean that while I love the scientific method, I know the process of science to be strongly biased by who performs it, and so it is absolutely necessary that we have many different people doing and thinking about science in order to have the best possible perspective on it.Back when I was a union organizer in grad school, my organizer and mentor told me that graduate school doesn't weed out the weak, it weeds out the strong: it weeds out those with strong senses of self who don't want to be exploited, who realize there are other things to do in the world and other ways to live a meaningful life. I think that is true for a lot of people who leave academia and science, and unfortunately most of the ones I know who left were women and people of color.Here's the problem. I want them back, I miss them: they were my dear friends. Those are the kinds of people we need to lead science, do science, communicate science, encourage and excite young people to be scientists.Reach out for people. Be an ally. Interrupt racism and sexism. Implement changes where you work to better recruit and retain people of color. Put people of color in positions of power: they probably know how to fix this mess much better than you do. Risk making mistakes; say you're sorry once you realize it.But whatever you do, don't just sit there.References...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Marquesan tattooing (rear), by Von de Steinen.

I’ve often given anthropological colleagues advice that could have been taken verbatim from my stints in sales school — they would probably be mortified if I knew about the dual purposing.  At times, I worry about my colleagues because I think that a whole series of situations in academia actually resemble sales situations: job interviewing, ‘open day’ for prospective students, grant writing, and even the first few lectures in an introductory class, when you’d be well served if you could persuade the assembled students that you’ve got something to say worth hearing.   

Anthropologists sometimes don’t seem terribly good at selling what they do. If you couldn’t convince a starving man to eat a sandwich, how can we persuade diverse audiences to pay attention to anthropology?

After my previous post on the ‘Vital topics forum,’ reader Jason Antrosio asked my opinion about Ulf Hannerz’s article from the same American Anthropologist: ‘Diversity is Our Business.’  Since I had been banging on about anthropology promoting itself as the study of human diversity, Jason probably assumed, quite reasonably, that I had already read Hannerz’s piece.  Alas, I hadn’t.  One of the many downsides of being laid up at home is that I only read the forum online and hadn’t really browsed the contents of the latest AA because my hard copy is likely still sitting in my office mailbox.

Hannerz’s piece, ‘Diversity is Our Business,’ is well worth the read not just because he explores how the field is misrepresented in the public eye; Hannerz asks what we might do as a field to counter-act anthro-bashing.  He wades into water that I prefer to plunge into neck deep here: what kind of brand is ‘Anthropology,’ how do we tell people about what we do, and do we need to perform a bit of brand management? 

Perhaps provocatively, in drawing on a characteristic current vocabulary, I would argue that anthropology needs to cultivate a strong brand. Those who feel ill at ease with that term, thinking that in its crassness it sullies their noble scholarly pursuits, can perhaps just as well continue to call it “public image” or even just “identity,” but in times of not just neoliberal thought but also of media saturation and short attention spans, it may be that “brand” is a useful root metaphor, a word to think with in the world we live in. (These days, too, not only corporations or consumer goods are linked to brands but also for example cities and countries.) Brands should attract outsiders: customers, visitors, members of the public. At the same time, they should preferably offer a fully acceptable identity for whoever may count as insiders to reflect on and be inspired by. (Hannerz 2010: 543)

Hell, yeah, we should think about Anthropology as a brand! With no trace of irony, I’d argue that we get serious about our collective self-promotion as a discipline.  Hannerz gets off to a good start, but I think we could even step up the campaign a bit, making use of the traditional strengths of our discipline to promote our intellectual and research potential.  And I’m going to take this opportunity, as well, to reply to some of the issues Daniel outlined in his piece, Anthropology and Publicity, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while.

Anthropology bashing

Hannerz begins his discussion with a reflection on Pres. Barack Obama’s use of ‘anthropological’ to describe when, during his campaign, Obama apologized for sounding out of touch.  Obama said he was sorry that he sounded as if he was ‘talking to a bunch of wine-sipping San Francisco liberals with an anthropological view toward white working-class voters.’ As Hannerz explains, Obama’s assumptions embedded in this apology grate for anthropologists because he takes for granted a public stereotype so at odds with our self-conception (and so ironic given that Obama’s late mother was an anthropologist):

Here it seems to me, then, that the candidate Obama assigns a stereotypically distant view, lacking in empathy, to anthropology—and then proceeds to sketch, as its opposite, precisely the sort of close, contextualizing understanding that we as anthropologists are much more likely to claim for ourselves. And from this particular source, we may find the stereotype so much more surprising because we might have thought this candidate should have got his anthropology right—but more about that later. In any case, here is an instance of a recurrent phenomenon that we might call “anthropology bashing.”  (Hannerz 2010: 541)

According to Hannerz, ‘anthropology bashing’ comes in four basic flavours:

Anthropologists are portrayed as cold and distant observers, ‘at worst, as someone who uses his skills to manipulate situations in ways which are detrimental to the human beings about which he has built up an expertise’ (Hannerz 2010: 541).  This image is of the ‘handmaiden’ of colonialism, a superior-feeling expert at manipulating natives, depriving them of their patrimony, and speaking in place of the cultures that we study.

Anthropologists, in contradiction, are depicted as ‘bumbling, incompetent observer who does not get even obvious realities right,’ as Hannerz puts it, less capable of ‘getting it’ than locals or even amateur observers.  This image is the anthropologist as dowdy professor-type who is ill-suited for life beyond the Ivory Tower but utterly oblivious to this fact.

As part of academia, Hannerz also worries that we are ‘easy target for a kind of populism that proclaims that research in and about far-away places is useless and that money devoted to it is therefore not well-spent.’  Here, Hannerz suggests that anthropologists are particularly prone to populist abuse, such as the ‘Golden Fleece Awards’ given by US Senator William Proxmire, often to projects that receive federal funding but have the bad luck to possess titles that Sen. Proxmire finds easy to mock.

Finally, Hannerz argues that anthropologists are bashed as being anachronistic and slightly out of date, pictured in pith helmets and safari suits with a mirthful chuckle that our field even still exists.  Ironically, I believe that one of the senior administrators at my own university had a giggle at our expense for this very reason, as if it was comical to think that anthropologists still were out there, wandering around, doing this funny old anthropology thing we do.

I could fiddle with this classification, but I think the list is quite good on the whole and demonstrates the key problem: not a single critique, but a lack of control over how we are perceived. Anthropologists need to invest more in getting our version of what we do before the public eye rather than let ourselves be defined by others.

If we look closer, what we find in a lot of the critiques are caricatures of us put forward by other people: indigenous ‘advocates’ who attack anthropologists, cultural studies scholars who try to make game of us, and the out-of-touch who assume that, if they don’t know what’s happening, there must not be anything happening in our field.  We often don’t take strong stands against these caricatures, or we take nuanced opposition to them that doesn’t do much to abate the more powerful rhetorical thrust of the criticism.

For example, when criticized for being complicit in colonialism, most cultural anthropologists will tend to roll over and go along with the criticism, conceding that, in fact, anthropologists have given indirect assistance and even philosophical justification for colonialism.  I think that this is a losing strategy in the public sphere.

Cui Yin Mok at the Open Anthropology Cooperative similarly argues that anthropologists have sort of lost their mojo as they’re going too self-critical ‘baggage’ that stops them from better describing their field to the public.

Anthropology’s troubled past and its roots in colonialism might...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Those who feel ill at ease with that term, thinking that in its crassness it sullies their noble scholarly pursuits, can perhaps just as well continue to call it “public image” or even just “identity,” but in times of not just neoliberal thought but also of media saturation and short attention spans, it may be that “brand” is a useful root metaphor, a word to think with in the world we live in. (These days, too, not only corporations or consumer goods are linked to brands but also for example cities and countries.) Brands should attract outsiders: customers, visitors, members of the public. At the same time, they should preferably offer a fully acceptable identity for whoever may count as insiders to reflect on and be inspired by. (Hannerz 2010: 543)

Hell, yeah, we should think about Anthropology as a brand! With no trace of irony, I’d argue that we get serious about our collective self-promotion as a discipline.  Hannerz gets off to a good start, but I think we could even step up the campaign a bit, making use of the traditional strengths of our discipline to promote our intellectual and research potential.  And I’m going to take this opportunity, as well, to reply to some of the issues Daniel outlined in his piece, Anthropology and Publicity, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while.

Anthropology bashing

Hannerz begins his discussion with a reflection on Pres. Barack Obama’s use of ‘anthropological’ to describe when, during his campaign, Obama apologized for sounding out of touch.  Obama said he was sorry that he sounded as if he was ‘talking to a bunch of wine-sipping San Francisco liberals with an anthropological view toward white working-class voters.’ As Hannerz explains, Obama’s assumptions embedded in this apology grate for anthropologists because he takes for granted a public stereotype so at odds with our self-conception (and so ironic given that Obama’s late mother was an anthropologist):

Here it seems to me, then, that the candidate Obama assigns a stereotypically distant view, lacking in empathy, to anthropology—and then proceeds to sketch, as its opposite, precisely the sort of close, contextualizing understanding that we as anthropologists are much more likely to claim for ourselves. And from this particular source, we may find the stereotype so much more surprising because we might have thought this candidate should have got his anthropology right—but more about that later. In any case, here is an instance of a recurrent phenomenon that we might call “anthropology bashing.”  (Hannerz 2010: 541)

According to Hannerz, ‘anthropology bashing’ comes in four basic flavours:

Anthropologists are portrayed as cold and distant observers, ‘at worst, as someone who uses his skills to manipulate situations in ways which are detrimental to the human beings about which he has built up an expertise’ (Hannerz 2010: 541).  This image is of the ‘handmaiden’ of colonialism, a superior-feeling expert at manipulating natives, depriving them of their patrimony, and speaking in place of the cultures that we study.

Anthropologists, in contradiction, are depicted as ‘bumbling, incompetent observer who does not get even obvious realities right,’ as Hannerz puts it, less capable of ‘getting it’ than locals or even amateur observers.  This image is the anthropologist as dowdy professor-type who is ill-suited for life beyond the Ivory Tower but utterly oblivious to this fact.

As part of academia, Hannerz also worries that we are ‘easy target for a kind of populism that proclaims that research in and about far-away places is useless and that money devoted to it is therefore not well-spent.’  Here, Hannerz suggests that anthropologists are particularly prone to populist abuse, such as the ‘Golden Fleece Awards’ given by US Senator William Proxmire, often to projects that receive federal funding but have the bad luck to possess titles that Sen. Proxmire finds easy to mock.

Finally, Hannerz argues that anthropologists are bashed as being anachronistic and slightly out of date, pictured in pith helmets and safari suits with a mirthful chuckle that our field even still exists.  Ironically, I believe that one of the senior administrators at my own university had a giggle at our expense for this very reason, as if it was comical to think that anthropologists still were out there, wandering around, doing this funny old anthropology thing we do.

I could fiddle with this classification, but I think the list is quite good on the whole and demonstrates the key problem: not a single critique, but a lack of control over how we are perceived. Anthropologists need to invest more in getting our version of what we do before the public eye rather than let ourselves be defined by others.

If we look closer, what we find in a lot of the critiques are caricatures of us put forward by other people: indigenous ‘advocates’ who attack anthropologists, cultural studies scholars who try to make game of us, and the out-of-touch who assume that, if they don’t know what’s happening, there must not be anything happening in our field.  We often don’t take strong stands against these caricatures, or we take nuanced opposition to them that doesn’t do much to abate the more powerful rhetorical thrust of the criticism.

For example, when criticized for being complicit in colonialism, most cultural anthropologists will tend to roll over and go along with the criticism, conceding that, in fact, anthropologists have given indirect assistance and even philosophical justification for colonialism.  I think that this is a losing strategy in the public sphere.

Cui Yin Mok at the Open Anthropology Cooperative similarly argues that anthropologists have sort of lost their mojo as they’re going too self-critical ‘baggage’ that stops them from better describing their field to the public.

Anthropology’s troubled past and its roots in colonialism might...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The sequencing of the orangutan (Pongo species) genome made the cover of Nature. It's grant-writing-dissertation-formulating-prelim-studying time for me so I haven't had a chance to read this one yet. Science has a couple paleoanthropology-related stories, including two by Ann Gibbons. The first is about recent research on ancient DNA, and how this informs the debate about 'modern human' origins. But there's also a short blurb on what the eff "species" means.

This is a great effing question! The textbook species definition is that proffered by Ernst Mayr: populations of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals, capable of producing viable (and fertile) offspring. Cool, so a dog and a cat are different species because if they mated (ew) no ungodly animal would come from this monstrous union. Expensive high-tech multivariate Scientific reconstruction simulations show the abomination would probably look like this:

But there are many "good" plant and animal species that do mate and reproduce successfully ('hybridize'). Very often these hybrids are sterile, but then very often they're not. This has led researchers to come up with scores of other ways to define species (Holliday (2003) has a great discussion on the matter).

Worse, there's no way to measure, genetically or morphologically, just how different things should be before they can be called different species. The late Morris Goodman and others (Wildman et al. 2003) argued that humans and chimpanzees are so genetically similar that chimps, now in the genus Pan, should be moved to our genus Homo to denote how similar we are. But any other, non-genetic comparison would put our chimp cousins in a very different group from us. Moreover, the effects of hybridization seem, to me at least, to be fairly unpredictable, at least superficially. That is, the outcome of hybridization is highly contingent on what animals are hybridizing, and on these lineages' own evolutionary histories (this is the intractable problem that made me abandon doing hybrid work for my dissertation. Some day though...).

A major issue relates to what I blogged about yesterday: both 'species' and 'hybrid' are terms we've found ourselves with, but they have no inherent meaning in themselves, other than whatever we give them. So it's funny to read this from Gibbons' story:In the real world, [Jean-Jacques Hublin] says, Mayr's concept doesn't hold up: "There are about 330 closely related species of mammals that interbreed, and at least a third of them can produce fertile hybrids."But is it Mayr's species concept that's flawed, or was it misguided to have put these hybridizers into different species in the first place? Should we delineate species based on our a priori conception about whether two things are different, or should a definition of 'species' determine what we call them? Or does it even matter?

To this end, Gibbons's other story describes the morphologically-unremarkable Denisova fossils as belonging to "a new type of human." Well, now what the eff does that mean? We're back to "The Species Problem" (the title of Gibbons's article), but with a new term. And pretend for a moment that the Denisovan fossils didn't yield DNA: the pinky and tooth probably would not have made headlines. Pretend they did have diagnostic cranial remains - would we have recognized them as being so distinct as their genes indicate?

For that matter, I wonder how many arguably 'modern' human fossils would still retain the modern moniker if we could analyze their genes...

At least, this is the conclusion from a fresh publication by Marianne Ryghaug and Tomas Moe Skjølsvold (“&lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a931921327~db=all~jumptype=rss"&gt;The global warming of climate science: Climategate and the construction of scientific facts&lt;/a&gt;” in &lt;em&gt;International studies in the philosophy of science&lt;/em&gt;). This finding is not news to the research community, but this analysis still hints that everything is not as it should be – because why would anyone report from a crime scene if the alleged crime has not even been committed? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background of this story (the “crime scene”) is a ‘Science and technology Study’ (STS) by Ryghaug and Skjølsvold, who  attempted to make some sense out of the leaked e-mails from CRU for clues on how climate scientists work. I must admit that I sometimes see some irony when reading texts from social sciences about the ‘tribalism’ of natural sciences. For instance, many of them use a very formalised language that can be hard to follow, while they describe different parts of the science community as ‘tribes’ with its own norms, codes, and dialects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One real difference between the ‘tribes’ of natural scientists and STS scholars may be the perception of ‘facts’: Ryghaug and Skjølsvold conclude that “scientific facts are made and not just discovered”. In contrast, I think most natural scientists feel that facts are facts, whether we know about them or not. Nuclear reactions and atoms were real, even before people knew about them. But Ryghaug and Skjølsvold’s assertion that “Fact-construction relies on persuasive skills” may give some people the wrong idea about how things work, perhaps ironically a bit like the word “trick” in the CRU e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images//gravitybird-300x225.gif" alt="" title="gravitybird" width="300" height="225" align="left"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denial or ignorance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Our scientific knowledge embodies the most convincing description we have of our universe, so I think they really mean that science is a ‘knowledge construction’, which involved publishing in the scientific literature, testing, review, etc. It seems to me that ‘facts’ for them refers to ‘established facts’ in the scientific knowledge. And construction is in a sense a bit like traditional mathematics which to a greater degree is based on a logical construction rather than sudden discoveries (the final answer sometimes can be seen as a discovery nevertheless). 
&lt;p&gt;But facts are based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_scientific_discoveries"&gt;discoveries&lt;/a&gt; too – for sure! Like the discovery of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicilin"&gt;penicilin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; by natural selection, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect"&gt;photoelectric effect&lt;/a&gt;. After the discovery, findings are interpreted, and the new knowledge must find a place in the framework based on all other knowledge since we like to think that our universe is self-consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryghaug and Skjølsvold argue that science is about communication, discussions, and persuasion. That may come as a surprise to some people, but it is fairly obvious to me. The author of &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/09/communicating-science-not-just-talking-the-talk/"&gt;Don’t be &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a scientist&lt;/a&gt;, Randy Olson, argues that communication is an integral and essential part of sciences that cannot be separated from the objective and analytical aspects. It does a scientist no good at all if their discoveries are not effectively transmitted to the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication, discussions, and persuasion play a role known as “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimenter%27s_regress"&gt;experimenter’s regress&lt;/a&gt;“, and this is an obvious way for science to proceed. Ideas are re-examined and tested over again for different situations, times, and settings, and findings which are consistently replicated can be regarded as a manifestation of some universal natural order. As opposed to an ‘audit’ which is limited to just one particular case, science is about approaching universal truth. Mainstream science is the consensus simply because it is most convincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having studied the discussions in the CRU-emails, Ryghaug and Skjølsvold find that they suggest that climate sciences appear to be doing scientific business-as-usual. As did earlier &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/04/second-cru-inquiry-reports/"&gt;inquiries&lt;/a&gt;. But this is not really the interesting part. The interesting story concerns the reactions in the aftermath of the CRU-hack and the notion of manipulation and the absence of transparency. In this story, it is a paradox that we only have seen the tip of the iceberg – what lies below the surface is hidden – while questions of manipulation and transparency has been at its heart (and hence Ryghaug and Skjølsvold’s STS study).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there wasn’t any improper manipulation of scientific data, the ‘manipulation’ in this story involved taking the contents in the e-mails out of context and the generation of wild accusations devoid of any real evidence. The manipulation really was about the perception of the climate research community and how that was presented in blogosphere and the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to transparency, I cannot think of any more murky environment than that of think tanks in which many accusers thrive. In order to be taken seriously, they need to be open too, sharing their code and raw data as they have demanded of Phil Jones and the CRU. I wanted to reproduce some results of a solar-climate study, but the authors &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18307-sceptical-climate-researcher-wont-divulge-key-program.html"&gt;refused to divulge their code&lt;/a&gt;. I have also asked to see the methods of some Norwegians who claim that climate models fail to reproduce the recent trends and have made a big fuss out of climategate  – all without a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that representatives from the contrarian community are the ones who really play the shady part in the story of “Climategate”. Has anybody ever seen the original data and methods from people like &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/12/please-show-us-your-code/"&gt;Scafetta &amp;amp; West&lt;/a&gt;, Svensmark, Lindzen, Michaels, Piers Corbyn, Lomborg, Easterbrook and Douglass? I haven’t. Similarly, I have seen no clamor in the contrarian blogosphere demanding it, even while their conclusions are eagerly accepted. I agree with Ryghaug and Skjølsvold that scientific knowledge is about persuasion, which implies that evidence must be presented in a clear and transparent fashion (divulging both method and data), published in the scientific literature, and tested over time. The evidence must sway the majority and create a consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a mystery to me why the mainstream media has not seen the real situation concerning who played the different roles and what was actually hidden – hence it could be appropriate to rename “climategate” to “climategåte”, where “gåte” means &lt;em&gt;riddle&lt;/em&gt; in Norwegian. We still don’t know who the hacker(s) was (were) (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/11/one-year-later/"&gt;and hack it was&lt;/a&gt;).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images//struts-300x267.png" alt="" title="struts" width="300" height="267"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the media actually see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media’s inability to perceive the real situation is a concern because it often holds a powerful position. Furthermore, journalism is supposed to unveil questionable practices, but apparently the media itself does not practice openness and transparency. There are questions that are relevant to the information we receive, such as: What happens in the editorial rooms and how are decisions made? What are the criteria for selecting the ‘experts’ for debates, and hence frame them from the start? What part of the story is left out in news reports (which can be considered as manipulation if citations are taken out of context or &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/swindled-carl-wunsch-responds/"&gt;video clips are cut and re-assembled in a way that gives the wrong idea&lt;/a&gt;) ? I would like to confront journalists and editors with these questions, because the real difference when it comes to power is not the scientific knowledge, but how it is communicated to the policy makers and the general public. Hence, I find it quite ironic that journalists I have talked to after the CRU-hack on the one hand were so preoccupied by manipulation and transparency and on the other didn’t seem bothered about these aspects when it came to how the story was told through the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some of these questions will be discussed at a seminar organised by &lt;a href="http://www.cicero.uio.no"&gt;CICERO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/norway.htm"&gt;British council&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.oxfordglobalmedia.com/"&gt;Oxford Global Media&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.ceres21.org/activities/20/Conference-Carbonundrums-From-Science-to-Headlines.aspx"&gt;‘Science to Headlines’&lt;/a&gt;) in Oslo on February 8. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that remains is whether the “climategate”-incident will end up boomeranging so that the people behind the CRU-hack will live to regret it. When the sun shines on the trolls in the old fairy tales, they burst. Shedding light on this story may do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>rasmus</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296201951375"><id gr:original-id="http://www.ionpsych.com/2011/01/28/hijacked-does-cocaine-take-control-the-brain/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f98c623ab2f34ded</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Hijacked.

Once again, I got into a debate with a close friend on Facebook. Actually, this time I jumped in rather late. But one of my good friends is a vegan who I happen to think has swallowed a little too much of the PETA Kool-Aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he posted the following status on his Facebook account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Today  while driving I saw one of the thousands of Nazi death trucks that they  transport cows in. This time it was empty; though, I have seen one  full. And I can’t fully express how sad and angry it makes me. To be  feet away from them while they are driven to be tortured and killed. I  just don’t understand why this is worth it so people can eat meat.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s the thing. I can sympathize with his anger. He has a particular view of the world and it bothers him to see such things that offend his sensibilities. I get it. It pisses me off every time I see the Pope not rotting in jail after covering up so many child rapes, and being very confident that he will almost certainly never be punished for his crimes because he’s too influential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while he actually was a literal Nazi…in a manner of speaking anyway. And while his organization has a somewhat dubious history of anti-Semitism and being on at least friendly terms with Hitler’s government, I recognize moral nuance. Sure, I make jokes from time to time, but when having a genuine intellectual discussions, I don’t throw the Nazi card out very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here my friend is calling vehicles transporting livestock “Nazi death trucks,” and from the comments of others, he seems quite sincere and confident that this is an appropriate analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree. Before I got to respond, Staks from Dangerous Talk had a fairly lengthy back and forth, criticizing him for “Glenn Becking” everyone who disagrees him, a term I rather like and think is appropriate in this instance. Staks’ focused on the hyperbolic and aggressive rhetoric as his chief criticism, so I didn’t devote much time to it myself since I think he more than sufficiently argued that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the following paragraphs are my lengthy response, which focused more on my opposition to the moral argument for vegetarian/veganism. I thought it was pretty substantive, so I figured it’d make a good editorial article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to concur with Staks. Now your rebuttal to criticisms of your &lt;a title="Reductio ad Hitlerum" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum"&gt;playing the Nazi card&lt;/a&gt; seems to be simply that in your case it’s apt, but as Jon Stewart so eloquently argued tonight in his criticisms of Fox’s use of the Nazi card, everyone always thinks their Nazi comparson is appropriate. And sure, on rare occasions like when you happen to be slaughtering Jews, it is apt. But in this case, it is a false analogy drawing on superficial similarities that rejects all nuance and attempts at reasonable discourse in favor of hyperbolic rhetoric designed to get attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazis didn’t rely on torturing and killing Jews for their very survival. If they did, they probably wouldn’t be so popular in analogies designed to dehumanize people’s political or ideological opponents because most people understand the survival drive. Indeed, as JFK once said, “A man does what he must – in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures – and that is the basis of all human morality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t confuse this for the naturalistic fallacy. For the first 500,000 years of human civilization, using meat and animal products was absolutely essential to our survival as a species. Had your ancestors chosen to live by your moral standards, none of us would be here now. And in most of the world, these resources are still absolutely essential to human survival. And up until maybe a 100 years ago, the decision to live a vegan lifestyle in a first-world country would be almost indistinguishable from the decision to commit suicide. The only reason we see a thriving vegan movement in first-world nations today is because science has finally devised methods for making it possible for people living in wealthy, privileged nations to live full, healthy lives with a diminished reliance on animal products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I have no problem with someone choosing to live this lifestyle, I for one am not very impressed by the moral argument when the lifestyle depends on one being privileged enough to live in a specific time and place in history when and where it  happens to be convenient. I can’t respect such a bourgeois moral system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you can choose to ignore the complex economics involved in making sure all the forces involved in getting sufficient vegan alternatives to an American retailer near you after being manufactured thousands of miles away, these are important, practical matters for most people. For instance, some family living in dilapidated conditions in some random third-world country doesn’t have a Whole Foods to shop at, or even an efficient trucking industry shipping huge quantities of tofurkies or whatever to a nearby grocer where it can then be sold at an affordable price. All I’m saying is the life you know, all this infrastructure you take from granted is absolutely essential to living according to your moral standard. Additionally, if everyone in America decided to suddenly become vegan tomorrow, that very infrastructure you rely on to get your vegan products would crumble because right now, our economy depends on the meat industry and they are too big to fail…right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the problem of anthropomorphizing the animals. Not all animals have the same capacity to suffer as human beings. And as far as we can measure, few of them are particularly self-aware. This too is problematic for the Nazi comparison..unless the argument is that Jews are not sapient, which is problematic for different reasons.&lt;br&gt;
Now as it so happens, &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/01/vegetarianism-moral-stance-or-mere.html"&gt;my vegetarian friend Michael De Dora just wrote an interesting article&lt;/a&gt; addressing this point in more depth. To quote one excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many vegetarians (and vegan, but let’s stick with one position) argue that we should not use animals as a means to some end, but as inherently important, worthy of certain rights and protections. This is a morsel from Immanuel Kant’s moral philosophy. Kant argued that every human being is deserving of respect (i.e., moral concern) because of its cognitive faculties – its autonomy, ability to reason, make free choices, and plan for the future. Vegetarians would have us expand this to non-human animals. But there is no reason to suppose that animals have such capacities, and I see little reason – judging from scientific evidence and philosophical thinking – to give them the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here, then, is where we reach an interesting juncture: if there are no compelling ethical reasons to not kill animals for food, then vegetarianism risks degenerating from a moral stance to the level of preference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then it comes back to, can we at least work towards treating farm animals less cruelly while we gradually move our society towards the seemingly inevitable, where we can more or less perfectly simulate meat and animal products and where it is both more efficient and cheaper to do so than to continue to raise livestock. Then you won’t be able to talk the meat industry out of switching to fake meat (Hell, &lt;a href="http://www.bsudailynews.com/mobile/news/taco-bell-only-uses-35-percent-real-beef-lawsuit-claims-1.2449104"&gt;Taco Bell has been using fake meat for years to save money&lt;/a&gt;). At which point, these domesticated animals will probably die off quickly as the damage is already done and these animals are not suited to the wild…but hey, at least they won’t become happy meals. Now I’m all for fighting for less cruel methods until we can successfully switch to completely to alternatives as it seems to be reasonable and an actual achievable goal, whereas “the meat-eaters are Nazis” gambit is entirely unpersuasive to anyone and will accomplish nothing to benefit the animals. It’s just a losing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

However, in the context of such back and forth fights about the desirability of pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement, we must step back and ask some basic scientific questions:- Do these drugs enhance brain function in people without ADHD or narcolepsy?- Do they work equally well in everyone?- Are there any cognitive trade-offs for using these drugs?This is why this review by Husain and Mehta is both timely and important. Some of the great points made include:1. We do not understand cognitive systems well enough to understand the potential trade-offs that may exist from taking a cognitive enhancing drug. There are counter-intuitive findings everywhere. For example, young adults who carry the APOE-4 allele (which has been associated with a higher risk of dementia later in life) actually have better performance on decision making tasks than those carrying the APOE-3 version. Therefore, it is plausible that drugs targeting memory systems might have detrimental effects on decision making tasks.2. It&amp;#39;s difficult to know how well cognitive enhancing drugs work in healthy people in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;. Although several studies have shown increased performance for certain laboratory tests of cognitive ability, there is no clear consensus about how these tasks translate into real-world academic or job performance. Furthermore, as most studies show small effect sizes and results in some, but not all tasks, there is a very real possibility that these drugs have no measurable effect outside of the laboratory.3. A small overall cognitive enhancing effect of a drug can come either from a small effect observed in all participants, or large effects in some participants and no effects in others. Previously, these authors have shown large individual difference in cognitive enhancers (I wrote about this here). In particular, participants with lower working memory capacity seem to have more enhancement from these drugs than those with larger working memories.4. A common complaint, but relevant nonetheless: the long-term effects of these drugs, taken for enhancement purposes, is unknown.What I particularly like about this paper is that it both outlines a needed future research plan while staying above the ideological ethical fray.   Husain M, &amp;amp; Mehta MA (2011).

Also, you've got to trust him when he asks you to do stuff...presumably like shoot up a school or physically assault a homosexual.&lt;blockquote&gt;God doesn't expect you to be perfect, but he does insist on complete honesty&lt;/blockquote&gt;I love that Warren knows exactly what God wants.  There was no irony in his voice at all.  &lt;i&gt;"Here's what the Creator of the Universe enjoys.  I know these things and you can tell I'm serious because I'm slightly pudgy and have a slick goatee."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Side note here: The tone of Warren's voice is getting really irritating.  It has been the same for the entire book so far and I'm assuming it will continue.  It's as though he's talking to a slightly slow eleven year-old who's just not understanding how to tell time.  &lt;i&gt;"Ok, so one-quarter of sixty is fifteen, so that means that fifteen minutes after any hour is called 'quarter past' the hour.  See?  It's easy!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Condescension from a place of ignorance.  Lovely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good news alert!  You can bargain with god!  Abraham did it with the destruction of Sodom and Job bitched a bit and then God defended him (nevermind that God fucked with Job over a stupid bet with the Devil).  Also, I guess Moses bitched a bit about the whole "wandering in the desert" thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warren intimates that God is &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;bored with predictable pious clichés&amp;quot;.&lt;/i&gt; Warren says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Until we mature enough to understand that God uses everything for good in our lives, we harbor resentment toward God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  So giving your six year old a terminal cancer is just God trying to teach you something good that you wouldn't get through your thick fucking skull any other way.  Got it?  Making your crazy husband murder you with an ax in the woods so he can &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/18/3115943.htm"&gt;make a magical lottery charm from the fetus&lt;/a&gt; in your belly, that's just God trying to make a point about something &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; to your family and friends.  That drunk driver who killed your brother?  God just wanted to make sure you understood some aspect of goodness.&lt;blockquote&gt;God always acts in your best interest, even when it's painful and you don't understand it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Right.  Forgive me if I don't believe you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus supposedly said, &lt;i&gt;"You are my friends, if you do what I command."&lt;/i&gt;  Quick note: I don't "command" my friends to do things.  Seems like a bit of an odd definition of friendship.  Maybe I'm weird.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warren actually said this gem&lt;blockquote&gt;We are friends with God, but we are not His equal.  He is our Loving Leader...&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Doesn't this sound creepily like something any random North Korean would say, through a thousand-yard stare, about Kim Jong Il?&lt;blockquote&gt;"Because we've been forgiven and set free, we obey out of love"&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Let me see if I understand this - you've been set free but you obey a "loving leader" blindly because you love him, even when you don't understand his commands and you've never even &lt;b&gt;seen&lt;/b&gt; this supposed being.  Gotcha.&lt;blockquote&gt;It is better to obey than to sacrifice&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Sure, but what if you're being commanded to sacrifice?  Dammit....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around this part of the chapter, my mind started to drift away.  So much mindless blathering.  Talking without really saying anything.  I can't believe this piece of crap is a worldwide bestseller.  It's actually depressing....&lt;blockquote&gt;...you must care about all the people around you whom God cares about.  Friends of God tell their friends about God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Please stay the fuck away from me with your proselytizing nonsense.  I'd prefer to sleep in on Sunday.&lt;blockquote&gt;God loves it when we're passionate with Him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Um, thanks, no.&lt;blockquote&gt;You are as close to God as you choose to be.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Awesome.  The 10-metre rule is in effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don't put effort into your "friendship" with God:&lt;blockquote&gt;...don't be surprised when God allows pain into your life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What a fucker.  He'll kill your kid, but remember...&lt;blockquote&gt;Pain isn't punishment, it's a wake-up call.&lt;/blockquote&gt;What incredibly fucking callous behavior.  &lt;i&gt;"Pay attention to me or I'll let really horrible shit happen to you and your family."&lt;/i&gt;  Oh sure, &lt;i&gt;"you're as close to God as you choose to be"&lt;/i&gt;, but if you're not as close as He'd like, he'll let some psycho murder your mom, or a tumor kill your baby.  Your fault!  You could have prevented all that shit if you just kissed my Universe-creating ass a little more passionately.  Ta-Daaaa!  Wake up call!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck Rick Warren and fuck his god.  As another aside, Ugandan homosexual activist &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12295718"&gt;David Kato was killed&lt;/a&gt; - beaten to death with a hammer by some asshole.  What does that have to do with Warren?  Well if you check &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-ward-iii/dear-ugandan-rolling-ston_1_b_814956.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; you'll notice this quote:&lt;blockquote&gt;...homophobia has always existed in Uganda, but the catalyst for violence truly came following a presentation by three U.S. evangelists -- Scott Lively, Don Schmierer, and Caleb Lee Brundidge -- in March 2009. As has been widely reported, they preached anti-gay lectures at a conference that laid the foundation for the "Anti-Homosexuality Bill" spit out of the Ugandan Parliament in the fall of 2009 by David Bahati.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Those three names, Lively, Schmierer, and Brundidge, are all associates of one Rick Warren - check &lt;a href="http://www.queerty.com/what-rick-warren-scott-lively-don-schmierer-did-in-uganda-is-nothing-new-heres-why-thats-horrifying-20100104/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for the relevant details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preaching homophobic nonsense has consequences.  It doesn't matter that Warren now condemns the "kill the gays" bill - which is exactly what it was, by the way.  The Ugandan magazine/paper &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; printed the names, photos, and addresses of the &lt;i&gt;100 Top Homos&lt;/i&gt; but editor Giles Muhame was not happy with the murder of Kato.  He said:&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been a lot of crime, it may not be because he is gay...We want the government to hang people who promote homosexuality, not for the public to attack them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;*sigh*/*facepalm*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Point to Ponder: I'm as close to God as I choose to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verse: Draw close to God and God will draw close to you.

Paul Mason is a PhD student at Macquarie University and frequent contributor to Neuroanthropology.  He is well on his way to finishing his thesis, but occasionally shares his insightful columns on a wide range of topics here.  Please note that the former ‘Fattest Man in the World’ is a different Paul Mason.

Have you ever woken up and not been able to move your body? For those people who have experienced this sensation, it is unnerving, surreal, and often quite stressful. Rest assured though, that this condition is benign, harmless, and your body will wake up after a minute or two. People also report that their body wakes up when someone touches them, or even at the sound of a surprising noise. Despite the temporary sensation of uncanny paralysis upon wakening, you can ride the episode out with the knowledge that it has not been associated with any medical disorders.

This condition, known as sleep paralysis, is rare but not uncommon. Funnily enough, in the last year, three of my friends have asked me about this condition—two of them medical doctors. Sleep paralysis is a parasomnia usually associated with REM sleep. Episodes typically last one to three minutes and disappear spontaneously by themselves or by someone else’s touch. Dreams can potentially superimpose onto reality during this period. However, the condition is usually experienced as a dream state without the dreams. In other words, your body has still turned off control of its muscles as though you are dreaming, but your brain is strangely awake. In medical terms, the condition is considered a dissociated REM state where the motor atonia of REM is present in isolation. That basically means that control of your muscles has been turned off but consciousness has been switched on.

When my friends asked me what I thought about the symptoms they described, I was reminded of my undergraduate study in neuropsychology where I learnt about lesion studies in cats that disrupted areas in the brain to do with sleep, dreaming, and muscle control. In this study, researchers performed lesions to areas of the brain in cats that normally inhibit motor control during sleep. The lesion was performed to the ventral locus coeruleus of the Pons (it’s weird what you remember sometimes). This lesion caused the cats to exhibit strange sleepwalking behaviour that allowed researchers an uncanny little window into Kitty dreams.

I’m not sure, but if you google ‘dream enactment’, then you should find plenty of information on the web. Anyway, my first thought about sleep paralysis was that there must be some kind of delay in switching off the area inhibiting motor control during a hypnopomic or postdormital sleep paralysis episode. I’m not suggesting that sleep paralysis is associated with anatomical problems, merely an occasional physiological hiccup—something as simple as say pins and needles in an otherwise healthy organ. Possibly the hiccup can occur in the Pons… Possibly, as recent research indicates, it could be somewhere else…

 Of my friends who shared their symptoms with me and asked me for my thoughts, one was doing shift-work, the other was suffering from severe jet-lag, and the third slept odd hours due to an erratic rotation schedule at her job. I’m not a medical doctor, but the suggestion of sucking a melatonin tablet under the tongue before bed for only a couple of nights worked wonders for my friend with jet-lag. But, you also have to consider that episodes of sleep paralysis are rare, so they probably disappeared by themselves. For my other friends I suggested potassium rich foods such as bananas, which are always yummy to eat anyway, (those friends haven’t told me of any episodes since, but then again that is anecdotal as well).

From scant research reports on the subject, it appears that sleep paralysis occasionally occurs in a familial form, affects females more often than males, and has an X-linked dominant transmission. Talking with my Indonesian friends suggests to me that the condition is not as rare as Western medical practitioners think. But then again, I have lived with Indonesians who have some extremely erratic sleeping schedules.

I am fascinated in the phenomenology and neurophenomenology of sleep paralysis episodes. One of my friends reported a hypnagogic auditory hallucination accompanying an episode of sleep paralysis. Not surprisingly, she is not the only person in her family to occasionally suffer from the condition.

In my own experience, I have had a hypnogogic visual hallucination as a child of five or six years of age. Before my teenage years, I also had an episode of what I now understand to be sleep paralysis. I woke up in the morning and could not for the life of me open my eyes. My eyelids were as heavy as lead (Pb), and then it felt like bees were performing the waggle dance all over my closed eyes. It was an overwhelming experience at the time but I can’t recall if I woke up or went back to sleep afterwards. If I’m not making stories up, I was eventually able to open my eyes, but then I shut them again and went back to sleep.

As a sidenote, the word ‘hypnagogic’ says so much to me about medical practice. A ‘hypnagogic hallucination’ is literally just a hallucination that one experiences just before or just after falling asleep. We don’t actually have an explanation for ‘hypnagogic hallucinations’, but we do have a fancy label with two lovely multi-syllabic words. On numerous occasions, friends have shared private stories about hallucinations with me. If they have been stressed by the episode then calming them simply involved asking if they were in bed at the time, which they have thus far always confirmed, and then I merely say,

“Don’t worry, you just experienced a hypnogogic hallucination. It’s not unusual in the slightest.”

On every occasion, labeling the episode makes a friend happy. I have even seen colleagues in medicine calm other acquaintances using the very same words. It’s fantastic, but it really makes me wonder how much people seek a label and how much people seek an explanation.

In research published in PNAS only in February last year (Magnin et al. 2010), researchers have made headway in describing the physiology underlying hypnagogic hallucinations. Using electrodes implanted into the brains of epileptic patients (a common pre-surgical practice to localise the origins of epileptic seizures), researchers opportunistically—but ethically—used the data to reveal what happens in the deepest parts of the brain during sleep onset. The activity of deep structures in the brain is difficult to image because MRI is too slow and EEG is too superficial. This electrophysiology research revealed a surprising finding:

The thalamus (a small but dense deep brain structure highly interconnected to body and cortical regions and involved in receiving sensory information) goes to sleep some ten minutes before the cortex.

When falling asleep, the thalamus shuts us off from the outside world, but the cortex continues to function which could explain, as the researchers hypothesise, how hallucinations can arise when we fall asleep.

A hypothesis about Sleep paralysis:

The finding that extensive cortical regions remain activated for several minutes after thalamic deactivation at sleep onset might explain forms of insomnia associated with lesions to the thalamus, and it also might be the reason that hypnagogic experiences commonly occur during the wake–sleep transition.

In the thirteen people studied, they did not find desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex during awakening. But that was only thirteen people. If someone who experienced an episode of sleep paralysis was under observation, would we find that awareness with paralysis upon waking was associated with a desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex? If the cortex reactivated before the thalamus could sleep paralysis be the result?

An episode of sleep paralysis typically only lasts a few minutes. Knowing that desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex during sleep onset lasts only several minutes, then it is not implausible to hypothesise that there could be a lapse between the reactivation of the cortex and the reactivation of the thalamus in sleep paralysis that lasts only a few minutes. If the cortex wakes up before the thalamus, people might be lucid but unable to move.

The cessation of sleep paralysis by physical touch might be explained by the idea that touch might be igniting sensory systems that activate the thalamus. As an ostensibly benign condition, and one that occurs rarely and unpredictably, sleep paralysis might not be the most accessible or indeed imperative area of medical research, but as a case of dissociative consciousness it is a deeply fascinating research venture into the awareness of who we are.

Have you ever woken up and not been able to move your body? For those people who have experienced this sensation, it is unnerving, surreal, and often quite stressful. Rest assured though, that this condition is benign, harmless, and your body will wake up after a minute or two. People also report that their body wakes up when someone touches them, or even at the sound of a surprising noise. Despite the temporary sensation of uncanny paralysis upon wakening, you can ride the episode out with the knowledge that it has not been associated with any medical disorders.

This condition, known as sleep paralysis, is rare but not uncommon. Funnily enough, in the last year, three of my friends have asked me about this condition—two of them medical doctors. Sleep paralysis is a parasomnia usually associated with REM sleep. Episodes typically last one to three minutes and disappear spontaneously by themselves or by someone else’s touch. Dreams can potentially superimpose onto reality during this period. However, the condition is usually experienced as a dream state without the dreams. In other words, your body has still turned off control of its muscles as though you are dreaming, but your brain is strangely awake. In medical terms, the condition is considered a dissociated REM state where the motor atonia of REM is present in isolation. That basically means that control of your muscles has been turned off but consciousness has been switched on.

When my friends asked me what I thought about the symptoms they described, I was reminded of my undergraduate study in neuropsychology where I learnt about lesion studies in cats that disrupted areas in the brain to do with sleep, dreaming, and muscle control. In this study, researchers performed lesions to areas of the brain in cats that normally inhibit motor control during sleep. The lesion was performed to the ventral locus coeruleus of the Pons (it’s weird what you remember sometimes). This lesion caused the cats to exhibit strange sleepwalking behaviour that allowed researchers an uncanny little window into Kitty dreams.

I’m not sure, but if you google ‘dream enactment’, then you should find plenty of information on the web. Anyway, my first thought about sleep paralysis was that there must be some kind of delay in switching off the area inhibiting motor control during a hypnopomic or postdormital sleep paralysis episode.

&lt;p&gt;Homeopathy is a popular but widely misunderstood form of alternative "medicine" based on pseudo-scientific principles.  Homeopathic "remedies" are allegedly made by diluting questionable remedies with &lt;em&gt;extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; amounts of water - often until there is only a slight chance of one molecule of active ingredient in the final treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extraordinary claims are causing consumers to forego traditional medical treatment, with estimates of Americans spending &amp;gt;$3B per year on this pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if such an initiative were to closely parallel Wycliffe, all it might take are some basic teachings of math, physics, biology, and geology combined with some casual text explaining scientific evolution and scientific marvels to get a book or body of work as big as the New Testament or even the Bible, which could then be translated into hundreds (if not thousands) of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like most (if not all) developed countries have (or should have) a basic science/math/logic curriculum, so I don’t know if I’m overreacting because Hawking’s book exists in only 20 or so languages while &lt;em&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/em&gt; exists in 190 (and the Qur’an in 112). Maybe spreading these words isn’t immediately necessary. But then there’s the spreading of science texts to less developed or “indigenous” peoples, in the same manner that the Bible has been spread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people everywhere ready for &lt;em&gt;The Pale Blue Dot&lt;/em&gt;? And if science is too much, then what about the spreading of non-Bible religious or philosophical texts? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wycliffe says they only translated the Bible for a community or people when the “spiritual” need is recognized by the Translators and/or the native individuals. Why answer such a need with only the Bible? Why not also the &lt;em&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Meditations on First Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting idea and I don’t know if it’s been actively pursued before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a group of people don’t have access to books in their native language, giving them something educational seems much more worthwhile to me than giving them false hope steeped in mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on whether something like this should happen at all and, if so, how to go about making it happen?&lt;br&gt;

Here is the major objection:

This idea is at odds with a proposal advanced by Richard Klein, a paleoanthropologist at Stanford University, that the emergence of some social or behavioral advantage — like the perfection of the faculty for language — was required for modern humans to overcome the surrounding human groups. Some kind of barrier had to be surmounted, it seems, or modern humans could have walked out of Africa 200,000 years ago.

Dr. Klein said that the Uerpmann team’s case for an earlier out-of-Africa expansion was “provocative, but in the absence of human remains, it’s not compelling.”

The stone tools of this era are all much alike, and it is hard to tell whether early modern humans or Neanderthals made them. At the sites of Skhul and Qafzeh in what is now Israel, early modern humans were present around 100,000 years ago and Neanderthals at 60,000 years, ......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Rest assured though, that this condition is benign, harmless, and your body will wake up after a minute or two. People also report that their body wakes up when someone touches them, or even at the sound of a surprising noise. Despite the temporary sensation of uncanny paralysis upon wakening, you can ride the episode out with the knowledge that it has not been associated with any medical disorders.

This condition, known as sleep paralysis, is rare but not uncommon. Funnily enough, in the last year, three of my friends have asked me about this condition—two of them medical doctors. Sleep paralysis is a parasomnia usually associated with REM sleep. Episodes typically last one to three minutes and disappear spontaneously by themselves or by someone else’s touch. Dreams can potentially superimpose onto reality during this period. However, the condition is usually experienced as a dream state without the dreams. In other words, your body has still turned off control of its muscles as though you are dreaming, but your brain is strangely awake. In medical terms, the condition is considered a dissociated REM state where the motor atonia of REM is present in isolation. That basically means that control of your muscles has been turned off but consciousness has been switched on.

When my friends asked me what I thought about the symptoms they described, I was reminded of my undergraduate study in neuropsychology where I learnt about lesion studies in cats that disrupted areas in the brain to do with sleep, dreaming, and muscle control. In this study, researchers performed lesions to areas of the brain in cats that normally inhibit motor control during sleep. The lesion was performed to the ventral locus coeruleus of the Pons (it’s weird what you remember sometimes). This lesion caused the cats to exhibit strange sleepwalking behaviour that allowed researchers an uncanny little window into Kitty dreams.

I’m not sure, but if you google ‘dream enactment’, then you should find plenty of information on the web. Anyway, my first thought about sleep paralysis was that there must be some kind of delay in switching off the area inhibiting motor control during a hypnopomic or postdormital sleep paralysis episode. I’m not suggesting that sleep paralysis is associated with anatomical problems, merely an occasional physiological hiccup—something as simple as say pins and needles in an otherwise healthy organ. Possibly the hiccup can occur in the Pons… Possibly, as recent research indicates, it could be somewhere else…

 Of my friends who shared their symptoms with me and asked me for my thoughts, one was doing shift-work, the other was suffering from severe jet-lag, and the third slept odd hours due to an erratic rotation schedule at her job. I’m not a medical doctor, but the suggestion of sucking a melatonin tablet under the tongue before bed for only a couple of nights worked wonders for my friend with jet-lag. But, you also have to consider that episodes of sleep paralysis are rare, so they probably disappeared by themselves. For my other friends I suggested potassium rich foods such as bananas, which are always yummy to eat anyway, (those friends haven’t told me of any episodes since, but then again that is anecdotal as well).

From scant research reports on the subject, it appears that sleep paralysis occasionally occurs in a familial form, affects females more often than males, and has an X-linked dominant transmission. Talking with my Indonesian friends suggests to me that the condition is not as rare as Western medical practitioners think. But then again, I have lived with Indonesians who have some extremely erratic sleeping schedules.

I am fascinated in the phenomenology and neurophenomenology of sleep paralysis episodes. One of my friends reported a hypnagogic auditory hallucination accompanying an episode of sleep paralysis. Not surprisingly, she is not the only person in her family to occasionally suffer from the condition.

In my own experience, I have had a hypnogogic visual hallucination as a child of five or six years of age. Before my teenage years, I also had an episode of what I now understand to be sleep paralysis. I woke up in the morning and could not for the life of me open my eyes. My eyelids were as heavy as lead (Pb), and then it felt like bees were performing the waggle dance all over my closed eyes. It was an overwhelming experience at the time but I can’t recall if I woke up or went back to sleep afterwards. If I’m not making stories up, I was eventually able to open my eyes, but then I shut them again and went back to sleep.

As a sidenote, the word ‘hypnagogic’ says so much to me about medical practice. A ‘hypnagogic hallucination’ is literally just a hallucination that one experiences just before or just after falling asleep. We don’t actually have an explanation for ‘hypnagogic hallucinations’, but we do have a fancy label with two lovely multi-syllabic words. On numerous occasions, friends have shared private stories about hallucinations with me. If they have been stressed by the episode then calming them simply involved asking if they were in bed at the time, which they have thus far always confirmed, and then I merely say,

“Don’t worry, you just experienced a hypnogogic hallucination. It’s not unusual in the slightest.”

On every occasion, labeling the episode makes a friend happy. I have even seen colleagues in medicine calm other acquaintances using the very same words. It’s fantastic, but it really makes me wonder how much people seek a label and how much people seek an explanation.

In research published in PNAS only in February last year (Magnin et al. 2010), researchers have made headway in describing the physiology underlying hypnagogic hallucinations. Using electrodes implanted into the brains of epileptic patients (a common pre-surgical practice to localise the origins of epileptic seizures), researchers opportunistically—but ethically—used the data to reveal what happens in the deepest parts of the brain during sleep onset. The activity of deep structures in the brain is difficult to image because MRI is too slow and EEG is too superficial. This electrophysiology research revealed a surprising finding:

The thalamus (a small but dense deep brain structure highly interconnected to body and cortical regions and involved in receiving sensory information) goes to sleep some ten minutes before the cortex.

When falling asleep, the thalamus shuts us off from the outside world, but the cortex continues to function which could explain, as the researchers hypothesise, how hallucinations can arise when we fall asleep.

A hypothesis about Sleep paralysis:

The finding that extensive cortical regions remain activated for several minutes after thalamic deactivation at sleep onset might explain forms of insomnia associated with lesions to the thalamus, and it also might be the reason that hypnagogic experiences commonly occur during the wake–sleep transition.

In the thirteen people studied, they did not find desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex during awakening. But that was only thirteen people. If someone who experienced an episode of sleep paralysis was under observation, would we find that awareness with paralysis upon waking was associated with a desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex? If the cortex reactivated before the thalamus could sleep paralysis be the result?

An episode of sleep paralysis typically only lasts a few minutes. Knowing that desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex during sleep onset lasts only several minutes, then it is not implausible to hypothesise that there could be a lapse between the reactivation of the cortex and the reactivation of the thalamus in sleep paralysis that lasts only a few minutes. If the cortex wakes up before the thalamus, people might be lucid but unable to move.

The cessation of sleep paralysis by physical touch might be explained by the idea that touch might be igniting sensory systems that activate the thalamus. As an ostensibly benign condition, and one that occurs rarely and unpredictably, sleep paralysis might not be the most accessible or indeed imperative area of medical research, but as a case of dissociative consciousness it is a deeply fascinating research venture into the awareness of who we are.

If you bind just one substrate it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything, even though its two active sites are separated by more than 30 Å. Only if the second substrate also binds does catalysis actually go at anything like a respectable rate. In a recent paper in Structure researchers from Yale report evidence that this change of pace results from a change in dynamics.

Apo- IGPS from Thermatoga maritima

PDB code: 1GPW

IGPS consists of two different protein subunits, HisH and HisF (right). HisH performs a relatively standard hydrolysis of glutamine, producing ammonia and glutamic acid. The ammonia molecule is then used by HisF as part of a cyclization reaction involving a weird nucleotide called PRFAR (with an IUPAC name that&amp;#39;s just too long to bother with). The products of this reaction feed into the biosynthesis of histidine (as you might guess from the name) and the purines. In an example of poor planning, however, the active sites for these two reactions are separated by a great distance. Glutamine hydrolysis takes place near the interface between the proteins (which bind to each other with nM affinity), while PRFAR cyclization takes place at the far end of HisF (near the bottom of the image). This is too far for the ammonia to be efficiently transferred by any direct action of the enzyme itself. Therefore, the reaction proceeds when the NH3 travels down the β-barrel of HisF to its distant active site (see image below left). The upside of this system is that ammonia gets where it needs to go. The downside of it is that unless the hydrolysis reaction only occurs when PRFAR is in position, this enzyme will be a little ammonia factory, costing the cell a fortune in nitrogen. Therefore, the cleavage reaction must be tightly regulated.

Enzymes can deal with this kind of demand in two ways. The first is to make the binding of one substrate depend on another. This is called K-type allostery because what is changed is the affinity (KD) of the enzyme for its substrates. Alternatively, the rate of catalysis can be altered, which is called V-type allostery because the velocity (Vmax) of the reaction is changed. IGPS uses the latter approach. When glutamine binds, NH3 gets eliminated at a stately pace of about 10-3 /s. If PRFAR also binds, however, HisH starts firing NH3 down the barrel at about 5 /s, which may not win many races but is a substantial enhancement. The question, then, is how the HisF active site lets the HisH active site know that PRFAR has arrived, when they are separated by more than 30 Å. Examining the enzyme complex in the presence of various ligands, James Lipchock and Pat Loria find evidence that changes to the dynamics of HisF are responsible for this communication.

A rotated view, looking through the barrel

towards the HisH active site.

The authors start by examining the energetics of PRFAR binding to IGPS. This event is endothermic, with an unfavorable enthalpy of binding. However, the entropic contribution is sufficiently large to overwhelm this effect. This could indicate a major increase in conformational entropy upon binding, or it could just be related to the behavior of water. Lipchock and Loria found that PRFAR binding to form the ternary complex had similar energetics. Of course, you can&amp;#39;t form a ternary complex with actual substrates for very long, because catalysis would occur and change the affinities. They dealt with this using acivicin, a glutamine analogue that binds covalently to the active C84 of HisH.

Unfortunately, these thermodynamic data aren&amp;#39;t particularly illuminating, so the authors proceeded with a high-resolution examination of the system. Because IGPS is a bit over 50 kDa in size, they chose to use methyl groups as their primary probes. Most of the remaining work in the paper uses ILV (Isoleucine, Leucine, Valine) labeling, which takes advantage of the favorable relaxation properties of the methyl groups of those side chains.

Lipchock and Loria started by examining the enzyme in its apo- state using relaxation-dispersion experiments. As I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, these experiments detect exchange between different conformations on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. If this represents motion between two well-defined states, then the apparent relaxation rate at a given refocusing field strength will be a function of total process rate (kex = kab + kba), the populations of the two states (pa and pb), and the chemical shift difference between them (Δω). If the exchange rate is fast on the NMR timescale (meaning that kex &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Δω), the last three parameters can be combined into a factor called φex.

This is how the authors fit their data, a choice they justified by stating that fitting the data to the full Carver-Richards formula (SI equations 8-18) gives similar answers for kex but yields large errors in the populations and chemical shift differences. However, most of the dispersion curves look like data from slower exchange regimes. Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m having trouble reconstructing their fitted curves from the parameters in any convincing way, in part because the equations in SI contain a few errors, so it&amp;#39;s difficult to discuss where the vulnerabilities in this fitting procedure lie.

Using their approach, Lipchock and Loria find that only a few residues are experiencing conformational exchange, and they believe that the motions are primarily local. I&amp;#39;m not so certain on that point: a quick examination of SI Table 1 indicates that all but two methyls have kex within error of 150 /s or so, which may indicate that most residues belong to a single process. However, most of the residues with similar fluctuation rates don&amp;#39;t physically group in any obvious way (although V100 and V79 are adjacent).

Regardless of the particulars, it&amp;#39;s clear that in the apo- state, few of the methyl groups in HisF are experiencing any kind of µs - ms fluctuation. Binding of acivicin to HisH doesn&amp;#39;t change this too much. Within the bounds of the fitted error, the extracted dynamics parameters are the same for many residues. The exceptions are the adjacent residues V79 and V100, and L153δ1, which has an odd halving of both rate and the combined parameter.

Also, as you can see in SI Table 2, the R2° values in this state are significantly lower than apo- IGPS. This is difficult to interpret without knowing exactly how the experiment was performed; they could represent additional ns fluctuations, the removal of some very fast global process, or simply different deuteration efficiency. However, some methyls do not appear to have large changes in their R2° values (e.g. V56γ2, I73δ1, L94δ1). Most of the spurious factors that would give rise to the observed changes in R2° should affect all residues more or less equally; the lack of uniformity suggests this may be worth following up on.

When Lipchock and Loria added PRFAR to the system, all hell broke loose. Many of the amide groups in the protein had their signals broadened beyond the detection limit, indicating conformational exchange on the intermediate timescale. In addition, a large number of methyl groups showed evidence of conformational exchange.

Here the fluctuation is obviously a genuinely incoherent one. Not only do the fitted kex values vary wildly across the protein, they also have poor fitting characteristics (including fitted errors greater than 100%), and enormous differences between adjacent methyls on a side-chain (e.g. L153δ1,2). This suggests that the two-state mode...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It's a grand dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://christianityinthepublicsquare.com/index.html"&gt;Tom Ritter&lt;/a&gt; dreams of a day when people recognize that he's more than just a cranky high school teacher, and they realize that all the scientists in the world have been completely wrong, while Truth lives in the sweaty cranium of a harumphing gomer in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He dreams of a day when everyone sees that &lt;a href="http://christianityinthepublicsquare.com/tom-ritter.html"&gt;he fills an important niche&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He dreams of a day when people realize that evolution is an unscientific theory, while Jesus is our Principal Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ritter dreams of a day when the kids get off of his lawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He dreams of a day when modern medicine finally figures out how to remove that stick from his butt. You know, the one with the pointy end pressing against his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's had these dreams for a &lt;a href="http://www.unscrewingtheinscrutable.com//node/546?q=log/node/546&amp;amp;q=node/546"&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.computernewbie.info/wheatdogg/2006/05/15/tom-ritter-evolution-debate-may-happen/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; now, but at last he's got a shot at glory, one chance to maybe have one of his dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.earnedmedia.org/prose0127.htm"&gt;Tom Ritter is suing Pennsylvania public schools for teaching evolution&lt;/a&gt;. Surely this won't make him look like a deranged looney from the sticks, unprofessionally bellowing his rage at a world he never made and never understood? This is his opportunity! Fate can't be so cruel as to continue to foster his reputation as the crazy, creepy chemistry teacher, the Milton Wadams of the Blue Mountain School District who sees evolution as his red Swingline stapler, his object of desire? No, of course not. Because his logic is sound, as strong as anything any creationist has ever come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is his professional, scientific argument. I've taken the liberty of footnoting it so that you can see how deep it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution is Unscientific&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The theory of evolution by cumulative natural selection is the only theory we know of that is in principle capable of explaining the existence of organized complexity." -- Richard Dawkins, famous Atheist&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biology studies organisms. It can also explain how organisms got that way, but studying organisms does not require explaining how they got that way&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the theory of evolution is bad science.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionists cannot demonstrate that three critical points are even possible, let alone that they actually happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) No one has demonstrated that life can be created from non-life.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  (Reports of artificial DNA do not alter this fact. Life is still required.)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) No one has demonstrated that a new "sexual species" can be created.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Since the definition of species is contested, for these purposes it is defined as an organism that can breed with its own kind and produce fertile offspring, but cannot breed with its ancestors.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Evolutionists theorize the human brain evolved from lower forms.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Over 50 years into the age of computers, machines can crunch numbers far better and faster than humans, recognize and use language and tools, and beat us in chess. Yet science has yet to build even a rudimentary computer that can contemplate its own existence, the hallmark of the human brain.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (Contemplating your existence is best understood as imagining what will remain after your death.) And no animal, no matter how "intelligent," can do this either.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone who espouses evolution if these three points are not true.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If evolution is unscientific, why teach it?&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Because no Creator means no God.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In other words, evolution taught without a possible alternative is Atheism.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Atheism rests on an article of faith (A strong belief that cannot be proven but is nonetheless believed).&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore Atheism is a religion.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is illegal to teach religion in the public schools.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I am not defending creationism or intelligent design. But evolution has not proven its case, and until it does, saying it is the only explanation for present life is Atheism.)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Because Tom Ritter says so, and only about a million scientists know he's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;And famous evolutionary biologist, but for purposes of Tom's argument, that's hardly relevant, where "relevant" is defined as "conflicts with my claim".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;True Science™requires closing your eyes to questions that might produce answers contradicting True Faith™.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;See title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Except that we are pretty sure the world lacked life before it had life, therefore life had to come from non-life at some point. Or perhaps Mr Ritter is also arguing with the Old Testament?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Similarly, any technology that allows life to be created doesn't count. Therefore this statement is irrefutable! Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;See previous unbreakable escape clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Because that would be really icky. If they aren't dead, they're really old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;For instance, I theorize that a small garden slug crawled into Tom Ritter's ear one day, worked its way into his cranium, and is now rasping away at his motor nerves to evoke strange twitchy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;50 years of computing certainly ought to be able to outperform 4 billion years of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Well, obsessing over the imagined fate of a magic wisp of personhood that survives blunt force trauma (or cranial slug invasion) might be the hallmark of the &lt;i&gt;Christian&lt;/i&gt; brain, but the rest of us…not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;OK. They aren't true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Aside from its explanatory power, the volumes of evidence in its support, its ability to guide further research, its practice by the overwhelming majority of biologists on the planet, and the necessity to understand the principles of evolutionary biology to understand taxonomy, physiology, development, cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, etc., etc., etc.? Well, no, aside from those, there really is no reason to teach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Unless you&amp;#39;re one of those wacky theistic evolutionists who think evolution is the mechanism god used to create life…but they&amp;#39;re all like Mormons or Scientologists, non-Christians, and therefore atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;This is a sweeping principle that will be expanded to cover other disciplines as well. Teaching auto repair without mentioning a magic car factory in the sky is atheism; teaching agriculture without discussing the angels who tug the shoots out of the ground is atheism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Which is also true for every single science, which makes them, by this definition, religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Just like chemistry, physics, agriculture, and auto repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;More simply, it is therefore illegal to teach, period, in the public schools. QED. Brains explode. Society melts down. Zombies stalk the streets while rains of frogs and blood predict the End Times. Mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Wait a minute there…Christianity hasn&amp;#39;t proven its case, either. Therefore Christianity is atheism? &lt;/p&gt;

This post composed as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=118266&amp;amp;org=NSF"&gt;NSF Science: Becoming the Messenger workshop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawrence KS January 27, 2011&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the present: global environmental change is a reality. This includes climate change, fragmentation and destruction of habitats, and human-caused movement of species all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means in the present is that over 1000 species have gone extinct in the past 150 years – species like the dodo bird, the passenger pigeon, and the Thylacine, the world’s only marsupial wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/dodo.jpeg" alt="" width="243" height="207"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More species are increasingly endangered or threatened. And we’re not just talking about the sexy species – the miniature elephants and giant non-flying birds. This massive wave of extinction – what is increasingly being called a “biodiversity crisis” and “6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Mass Extinction” –  will over time include more and more species important for synthesizing new medicines and vaccines, growing better and more parasite-resistant crops, improving water quality and standards of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does this mean for the future?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Who knows?! Modern biological studies of the effects of changing environment on the Earth’s species at most span 10-30 years. Yet the average species lives 3-10 million years! It’s no wonder that using these data to create accurate predictive future models have proven challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/polarbear_iceberg-300x278.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="278"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOBODY wants a picture book to be the only place their kids see a polar bear, a tiger, a white shark, or a blue whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we come up with reasonable, economically and socially feasible solutions for a problem we can’t fully understand in the present? We need more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s an easy place to go for just that – predictive information for how species fair in the face of change – and that place is the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fossil record contains over 550 million years of history illustrating how species responded to changing climate, habitat loss/degradation, and invasion from other species. This is a natural laboratory for figuring out why and which species are likely to succumb to extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make use of this wealth of historical data to better understand our present and help us mitigate the impacts of these changes on our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleontology may be the study of extinct species – but let’s not allow paleontology to become the biology of the future; and prevent humans from going the way of the dodo bird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSF Experimental Program for Competitive Research funds Kansas scientists and empowers cutting edge research in climate and energy. Kansas researchers have joined forces to create a center that interweaves research in climate and energy in order to leverage the collective knowledge about these important global issues.  Four Kansas Universities are involved including the University of Kansas, Kansas State University, Wichita State University, and Haskell Indian Nations University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collective brainpower of over 60 researchers from all disciplines ranging from the social sciences, natural sciences through engineering are involved in the massive initiative. Participants are working on projects that run the gamut from consulting with Kansas farmers about how the climate is affecting their decisions as to which crops to sow, to building better photovoltaic cells using nanotechnology. Data gathered from the project will help Kansas farmers and other stakeholders such as policy makers in future decision making.  The projects also will impact the economic growth potential in Kansas as they forge links with local industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to doing cutting edge research, an integral part of the project is training the future scientists and engineers in Kansas.  Because of the unique nature of the project, which blends climate and energy research efforts, students from K-12 and up are benefiting from the collective knowledge being garnered in two of the most critical global challenges.              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the equator, clay-rich, red-orange soils, several meters deep and nutrient-poor form due to  large amounts of year-round precipitation. Beneath the prairies, in semi-arid to humid regions, black soils, just a meter deep, support the breadbaskets of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is clear that climate exerts great influence on soil properties and soil-forming pathways, we do not understand this relationship well.  And, this means, in the shadow of global warming, that we can’t predict how climate change will affect soils around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you care?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Most of us don’t even think about the soil beneath our feet. Soils, however, are essential to feeding the world.  Soils take thousands of years to form and properties such as soil structure, that are crucial to water movement in soil and availability of water to plants, cannot be created by man – only by nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists must cross disciplines and study the soil climate relationship in order to determine the potential future of this essential and non-renewable natural resource. Our understanding of how climate change will affect the soil is crucial to our ability to feed ourselves, and our children’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists need to communicate with the public, and the workshop I’m at right now is focused on helping them do that.  One of the main concerns that keeps coming up is whether scientists have to “sell their souls” in order to engage the public’s attention.  Scientists are worried about sacrificing content and details for entertainment.  We’ve heard about how we ought to keep our talking points simple and focused, and how we ought to “frame” our content to speak to people’s interests.  Examples have included framing science content in terms of economic or national security interests.  There’s been much interest, but some skepticism.  Why are scientists skeptical about using effective communication techniques?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group at Kansas State University (myself included) have been wondering about that question.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The results from surveys and interviews from the &lt;a href="http://www.k-state.edu/philos/ethics-science-communication/index.html"&gt;Research Communications Ethics Project &lt;/a&gt; suggest that scientists know that these techniques are effective, especially at garnering interest, but resist because of ethical concerns.  In particular, we think one of the reasons scientists resist is that they want not to tell people what to believe, but think it is more ethically appropriate to give people data and decide what to think on their own.  But we know from psychological research that people (scientists included!) use data only in a context—it is only when put into a context that provides background information, interpretive metaphors, and values that information is actually used by people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If scientists want to help people use science, they need to give them information in ways it can be used.  So let’s get out and try to engage, motivate, and convince honestly.  We should resist the worst tools that truly manipulate, but not be afraid of giving our opinions, and of providing our results in ways that let people use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition, environment, genetic foundations of individual tree fitness- All these factors and more can influence response to disturbance events in forest communities.  Disturbance events such as drought and pest infestations can trigger tree mortality and impair important forest function such as carbon sequestration, water purification, wildlife habitats, recreation and timber industry uses.  With disturbance events predicted to increase in frequency in the future,  understanding the impacts of disturbance on tree mortality can further our understanding of forest ecosystem functioning in the future.  The multiple aspects that influence forest mortality and decline event can complicate studies of disturbance impacts.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A major oak decline event occurring in recent decades in Northwest Arkansas provides insight into the impacts of disturbance on forest ecosystems, which is important for understanding the future of global carbon and climate cycles as disturbance is predicted to increase in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/smaller-coring-tree.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/smaller-coring-tree-288x300.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through analysis of stable carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes and analysis of differential responses among co-occurring individuals, we can infer that differences in the physiological response of &lt;em&gt;Quercus rubra &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;macrocarpa&lt;/em&gt; to disturbance events influenced individual resilience to mortality following disturbance events.  Understanding the impacts of disturbance events will enable us to predict the future of ecosystem services – ranging from timber and recreation to carbon sequestration and local hydrology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic argument is that it is important to understand as much of the world around us as possible (a common statistic passed around is that &lt;a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/websites/retiredsites/supp_oceanpanel.html"&gt;95% of the world’s oceans remain unexplored&lt;/a&gt;). We are losing biodiversity as fast as we can catalogue it.  Imagine every species as a book.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Each of these books is unique—some contain information on how to cure disease, some may provide solutions to the world’s food crises, some may even provide ideas for alternative fuels.  As we learn about each new species, we write these books.  Meanwhile, these books are being destroyed, ground to a pulp or slimed with oil often before they can be finished or shared.  If we stop writing these books and allow destruction to overtake creation of knowledge, how long will it be before our species libraries are empty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the real reason this research should be funded is education.  Sure, it’s exciting to go into the field and do research, but what happens when we come back from the beach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when the work begins.  Legions of undergraduate students are trained to process samples and data, performing all manner of analyses in the lab.  These students, more often then not, go on to careers with more immediate utility in fields like medicine and technology.  What starts as two weeks on a reef ends with training future doctors and chemists in the tools they need to remain competitive in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you thinking about a high priced camera, bright lights and some makeup? Well that’s not what’s going to enable us to make the critical decisions that will be necessary to decide our energy future. More specifically the biofuels picture is complex and can be quite overwhelming at first look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are any number of possible liquid biofuels that we may be putting in the gas tank of our next vehicle. You may have heard of Ethanol, Biodiesel. There are many other options that exist and many more that will become the next best thing in the near future. Each of these are produced from different feedstocks and will require different processes in order to be feasible and scalable.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/85607972.thb_.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/85607972.thb_-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the limited amount of resources available to bring these fuels to scale, decisions will have to be made. This is where modeling enters the picture. There are a number of efforts underway that are attempting to understand these trade offs. One notable effort is the &lt;a href="http://www.jbei.org/deconstruction/technoeconomic_model.shtml"&gt;Joint BioEnergy Institute’s effort&lt;/a&gt;. The questions that it tries to address help guide the development of future candidate fuels. At the University of Kansas, the &lt;a href="http://www.kutri.ku.edu/research/project/williams.html"&gt;Feedstock to Tailpipe&lt;/a&gt; effort, of which I am a part, has brought a team of scientist together from a myriad of disciplines that will help to answer many questions that will enable this modeling as well. More interestingly there are a number of global models, like the International Institute of Advanced System Analysis’s &lt;a href="http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/ENE/model/"&gt;Integrated Modeling Framework&lt;/a&gt;, that could eventually enable a predictive evaluation of what competing processes will be viable in a changing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make informed decisions in the future we will have to model. This modeling is not quite as glamorous, but it has to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was checking out at the local grocery store, I noticed that I could buy a laser pointer at register along with packs of gum and candy.  Lasers can be found nearly everywhere, ubiquitous in our culture (thanks George Lucas); however most people do not understand the fundamental difference between light from a laser and that from the sun or a light emitting diode (LED).  In fact, most people do not realize that laser light is NOT produced from natural sources (except for some distance astronomical sources) and is a completely human invention on the earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes laser light different than that from the sun?  The light from a laser is coherent, which means that the light produced by the laser is in phase and monochromatic, the peaks of all waves are aligned like an individual musicians marching together in a drum corps playing the same tune.  The sun produces incoherent light, where the waves are all out phase with each other and at different frequencies, like each musician marching to a different drummer and each playing a different tune.  Ever see a laser spot ‘speckle’ on a wall?  Wow, you are directly seeing the coherence with your eye.  You will never see sunlight speckle like that.  If sunlight is natural light, a laser is very unnatural light.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt: Hyenas have significant PR issues…Disney is, at least in recent times, guilty of making these animals appear nothing except foolish and useless…. simply put there’s never really been much effort dedicated towards “saving the hyenas”…&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/sm1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/sm1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with all stories, there is, however, a different side to this. Hyenas are actually incredibly adaptable to overcome changes in their environment, and importantly they’re amazingly capable of resisting infections. Although hyenas are highly skilled hunters, they are also renowned as scavengers that feed of off carcasses filled with huge loads of pathogens that would kill most other types of living beings – humans included…&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why should any of us even care about the health of hyenas? In fact, how hyenas defend themselves against infections hold important answers to how “super-bugs” might be overcome. In short, the hyena – despite its poor reputation within the general public – may turn out as an important resource for improving human health….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many type of infections are becoming increasingly resistant to commercially available antibiotics, which is creating a need for new and improved drugs.  Our team is working on translating small molecules from hyena saliva into clinically useful new drugs to treat multi-drug resistant bugs to help improve human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, one of the most “unappreciated species on Earth” might end with a record-number of “FaceBook” friends…&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever woken up and not been able to move your body? For those people who have experienced this sensation, it is unnerving, surreal, and often quite stressful. Rest assured though, that this condition is benign, harmless, and your body will wake up after a minute or two. People also report that their body wakes up when someone touches them, or even at the sound of a surprising noise. Despite the temporary sensation of uncanny paralysis upon wakening, you can ride the episode out with the knowledge that it has not been associated with any medical disorders.

This condition, known as sleep paralysis, is rare but not uncommon. Funnily enough, in the last year, three of my friends have asked me about this condition—two of them medical doctors. Sleep paralysis is a parasomnia usually associated with REM sleep. Episodes typically last one to three minutes and disappear spontaneously by themselves or by someone else’s touch. Dreams can potentially superimpose onto reality during this period. However, the condition is usually experienced as a dream state without the dreams. In other words, your body has still turned off control of its muscles as though you are dreaming, but your brain is strangely awake. In medical terms, the condition is considered a dissociated REM state where the motor atonia of REM is present in isolation. That basically means that control of your muscles has been turned off but consciousness has been switched on.

When my friends asked me what I thought about the symptoms they described, I was reminded of my undergraduate study in neuropsychology where I learnt about lesion studies in cats that disrupted areas in the brain to do with sleep, dreaming, and muscle control. In this study, researchers performed lesions to areas of the brain in cats that normally inhibit motor control during sleep. The lesion was performed to the ventral locus coeruleus of the Pons (it’s weird what you remember sometimes). This lesion caused the cats to exhibit strange sleepwalking behaviour that allowed researchers an uncanny little window into Kitty dreams.

I’m not sure, but if you google ‘dream enactment’, then you should find plenty of information on the web. Anyway, my first thought about sleep paralysis was that there must be some kind of delay in switching off the area inhibiting motor control during a hypnopomic or postdormital sleep paralysis episode. I’m not suggesting that sleep paralysis is associated with anatomical problems, merely an occasional physiological hiccup—something as simple as say pins and needles in an otherwise healthy organ. Possibly the hiccup can occur in the Pons… Possibly, as recent research indicates, it could be somewhere else…

 Of my friends who shared their symptoms with me and asked me for my thoughts, one was doing shift-work, the other was suffering from severe jet-lag, and the third slept odd hours due to an erratic rotation schedule at her job. I’m not a medical doctor, but the suggestion of sucking a melatonin tablet under the tongue before bed for only a couple of nights worked wonders for my friend with jet-lag. But, you also have to consider that episodes of sleep paralysis are rare, so they probably disappeared by themselves. For my other friends I suggested potassium rich foods such as bananas, which are always yummy to eat anyway, (those friends haven’t told me of any episodes since, but then again that is anecdotal as well).

From scant research reports on the subject, it appears that sleep paralysis occasionally occurs in a familial form, affects females more often than males, and has an X-linked dominant transmission. Talking with my Indonesian friends suggests to me that the condition is not as rare as Western medical practitioners think. But then again, I have lived with Indonesians who have some extremely erratic sleeping schedules.

I am fascinated in the phenomenology and neurophenomenology of sleep paralysis episodes. One of my friends reported a hypnagogic auditory hallucination accompanying an episode of sleep paralysis. Not surprisingly, she is not the only person in her family to occasionally suffer from the condition.

In my own experience, I have had a hypnogogic visual hallucination as a child of five or six years of age. Before my teenage years, I also had an episode of what I now understand to be sleep paralysis. I woke up in the morning and could not for the life of me open my eyes. My eyelids were as heavy as lead (Pb), and then it felt like bees were performing the waggle dance all over my closed eyes. It was an overwhelming experience at the time but I can’t recall if I woke up or went back to sleep afterwards. If I’m not making stories up, I was eventually able to open my eyes, but then I shut them again and went back to sleep.

As a sidenote, the word ‘hypnagogic’ says so much to me about medical practice. A ‘hypnagogic hallucination’ is literally just a hallucination that one experiences just before or just after falling asleep. We don’t actually have an explanation for ‘hypnagogic hallucinations’, but we do have a fancy label with two lovely multi-syllabic words. On numerous occasions, friends have shared private stories about hallucinations with me. If they have been stressed by the episode then calming them simply involved asking if they were in bed at the time, which they have thus far always confirmed, and then I merely say,

“Don’t worry, you just experienced a hypnogogic hallucination. It’s not unusual in the slightest.”

On every occasion, labeling the episode makes a friend happy. I have even seen colleagues in medicine calm other acquaintances using the very same words. It’s fantastic, but it really makes me wonder how much people seek a label and how much people seek an explanation.

In research published in PNAS only in February last year (Magnin et al. 2010), researchers have made headway in describing the physiology underlying hypnagogic hallucinations. Using electrodes implanted into the brains of epileptic patients (a common pre-surgical practice to localise the origins of epileptic seizures), researchers opportunistically—but ethically—used the data to reveal what happens in the deepest parts of the brain during sleep onset. The activity of deep structures in the brain is difficult to image because MRI is too slow and EEG is too superficial. This electrophysiology research revealed a surprising finding:

The thalamus (a small but dense deep brain structure highly interconnected to body and cortical regions and involved in receiving sensory information) goes to sleep some ten minutes before the cortex.

When falling asleep, the thalamus shuts us off from the outside world, but the cortex continues to function which could explain, as the researchers hypothesise, how hallucinations can arise when we fall asleep.

A hypothesis about Sleep paralysis:

The finding that extensive cortical regions remain activated for several minutes after thalamic deactivation at sleep onset might explain forms of insomnia associated with lesions to the thalamus, and it also might be the reason that hypnagogic experiences commonly occur during the wake–sleep transition.

In the thirteen people studied, they did not find desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex during awakening. But that was only thirteen people. If someone who experienced an episode of sleep paralysis was under observation, would we find that awareness with paralysis upon waking was associated with a desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex? If the cortex reactivated before the thalamus could sleep paralysis be the result?

An episode of sleep paralysis typically only lasts a few minutes. Knowing that desynchronisation of the thalamus and cortex during sleep onset lasts only several minutes, then it is not implausible to hypothesise that there could be a lapse between the reactivation of the cortex and the reactivation of the thalamus in sleep paralysis that lasts only a few minutes. If the cortex wakes up before the thalamus, people might be lucid but unable to move.

The cessation of sleep paralysis by physical touch might be explained by the idea that touch might be igniting sensory systems that activate the thalamus. As an ostensibly benign condition, and one that occurs rarely and unpredictably, sleep paralysis might not be the most accessible or indeed imperative area of medical research, but as a case of dissociative consciousness it is a deeply fascinating research venture into the awareness of who we are.

My articles deal with the science of science fiction, and in that vein my latest is &lt;a href="http://blastr.com/2011/01/5-biggest-astronomical-mi.php"&gt;the Top Five astronomy screwups in movies that should’ve known better&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, that might seem like an impossible choice, which is why I added that last bit. Picking the five worst mistakes would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Armageddon &lt;br&gt;
4) Armageddon  &lt;br&gt;
3) Armageddon  &lt;br&gt;
2) Armageddon, and  &lt;br&gt;
1) Armageddon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and I’m not sure there exist enough integers to cover all of &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/armpitageddon.html"&gt;that movie’s mistakes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I modified it by picking movies that really shouldn’t have made the gaffes in the first place. My number one pick was a mistake that really, in the scheme of things, wasn’t so bad, but given the movie itself… well, you’ll just have to go over there and read it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know my audience: there’s probably not a single person on the planet who agrees with me on the list, whether it’s the choices or the order.

&lt;p&gt;Whether they’re putting their star power or their money (or both) into projects to protect and save the earth, or just help make it a better place for all of us to live, Hollywood celebrities have a long history of supporting environmental programs and projects. (And the good PR doesn’t hurt their careers, either.) And while it’s all too easy for spoiled celebs to end up in rehab or make the news for less-than-noble antics (Mel and Charlie, this means you), the ten who made our gallery are doing the opposite — setting a good example for others by living environmentally-conscious lives, and encouraging the rest of us to do the same. Here’s who and how:&lt;/p&gt;

The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my heart sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come with them..." -&lt;i&gt;Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Just last week, I wrote to you about one of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra.php"&gt;deepest images of the distant Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/hudf_300dpi-thumb-500x500-60716.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field"&gt;Hubble Ultra Deep Field&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in particular, how we're able to find and identify some incredibly ultra-distant galaxies -- despite their incredibly large redshifts -- thanks to the magnification from the gravity of intervening matter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/hs-2011-04-b-print.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/hs-2011-04-b-print-thumb-500x371-60718.jpeg" width="500" height="371" alt="hs-2011-04-b-print.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are visual candidates in the green circles, where some of the light still appears red, and purely infrared candidates in the red circles, which is right at the limit of what Hubble can detect!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/26/another-record-breaker-ultra-deep-image-reveals-ultra-distant-galaxy/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BadAstronomyBlog+(Bad+Astronomy)&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/82855/long-ago-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away/"&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://firstgalaxies.org/the-first-galaxies"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110126/full/news.2011.47.html"&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; when, from examining these images in detail, a record-breaking galaxy was discovered!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/hudf_z10.3galaxy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/hudf_z10.3galaxy-thumb-500x500-60722.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="hudf_z10.3galaxy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: NASA, ESA, and the &lt;a href="http://firstgalaxies.org/hudf09"&gt;HUDF09 team&lt;/a&gt;, Illingsworth et al.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completely invisible in ultraviolet and visible light, the light that was &lt;i&gt;emitted in the ultraviolet (UV)&lt;/i&gt; from this galaxy is so severely redshifted that it appears at the far edge of what Hubble can see &lt;i&gt;in the infrared (IR)&lt;/i&gt;!  In fact, this galaxy -- at a redshift of &lt;b&gt;10.3&lt;/b&gt; -- is a record breaker, and the only one known of its kind (although there are other &lt;i&gt;candidates&lt;/i&gt; out that far).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being so far away and so &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/redshift_and_distance_in_the_e.php"&gt;redshifted&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/q_a_how_is_the_universe_so_big.php"&gt;expansion of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, these ultra-distant galaxies -- the ones beyond a redshift of 6.5 (or back when the Universe was less than 800 million years old, as opposed to the 13.7 billion years old it is today) -- have to contend with something else.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;i&gt;neutral gas&lt;/i&gt; out there, blocking the starlight coming from these distant galaxies!  And just like you'd expect, the more neutral gas you have to pass through, the brighter you need to be in order to make it through!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/eso0102c.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/eso0102c-thumb-500x258-60729.jpeg" width="500" height="258" alt="eso0102c.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, going to higher and higher redshifts is, to put it mildly, &lt;i&gt;harsh&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To see something at a redshift of 7, you've got to go through about 50 million light-years of space where around 1% of the gas living there is neutral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To see something at a redshift of 8, you've got to go through an &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt; 100 million light-years of space where around 3% of the gas living there is neutral, in addition to the stuff you need to get here from a redshift of 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And to see something at a redshift of 10, in addition to what happens at a redshift of 8, you've got to go through an additional 150 million light-years of space where something like 6% of the gas is neutral!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, unsurprisingly, people are already talking about &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110126/full/news.2011.47.html"&gt;how there should be more galaxies&lt;/a&gt; at this redshift than we're seeing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt;.  First off, astronomically, you're always going to see the &lt;i&gt;brightest&lt;/i&gt; distant objects &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt;.  That's a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmquist_bias"&gt;well-known effect&lt;/a&gt;.  Second, the Universe is already &lt;i&gt;500 million years old&lt;/i&gt; by a redshift of 10, which means, &lt;i&gt;conservatively&lt;/i&gt;, that we've had plenty of galaxies around for at least two-to-three hundred million years by then.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/cosmic_timeline.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/cosmic_timeline-thumb-500x394-60735.jpeg" width="500" height="394" alt="cosmic_timeline.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;b&gt;Hubble isn't built for this&lt;/b&gt;!  It's completely remarkable that we're able to find these things at all using it, and that speaks volumes to the ingenuity of the astronomers working with these tools and data.  But this is &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they're building and excited about the &lt;a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; designed to look back that far.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/_42547337_graphic_bbc_416.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ/_42547337_graphic_bbc_416-thumb-500x322-60737.jpeg" width="500" height="322" alt="_42547337_graphic_bbc_416.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; to be seeing and identifying galaxies this young, and we're doing it &lt;i&gt;for the first time ever&lt;/i&gt;.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg; things are only going to get better from here! &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/big_news_from_the_distant_univ.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296164585888"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=27355">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e97d65a84e05454</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LOLz"/><title type="html">Evolutionary psychology</title><published>2011-01-27T21:41:57Z</published><updated>2011-01-27T21:41:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/evolutionary-psychology/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a display of male aggression, &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2011/01/27/state/n050426S19.DTL"&gt;a California math professor was arrested for scent-marking the office door of a colleague&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Their delicate balance of sweetness and tartness is a biochemical masterpiece. It's no wonder that they, of all nature's tasty options, are the highest value fruit crop in terms of international trade, with over 105 million tons produced annually. But these tempting produce face a persistant villain that seeks to destroy their roots; a menace known, cleverly, as the citrus root weevil. 

The weevil's grubby larvae feed like maggots on the vital roots of citrus plants. Native to the Caribbean, this crop-destroying pest wreaks havoc on citrus farms in Florida and California, causing approximately $70 million in damage annually in the US. Farmers have tried a variety of control methods, including ants, parasitic wasps, and even a virus, but they simply don't keep up with the birth rate of the pesky weevils. A female weevil can lay up to 5,000 eggs at a time, each of which burrows into the roots of its host plant, depriving it of water and nutrients and making it vulnerable to infection by deadly fungi. 

But the citrus plants don't just sit idly and allow the weevil larvae to eat their tender roots: they call for backup, emitting chemical signals that attract weevil larvae-killing nematodes.

And this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint statement of the European Parliament's Intergroup of LGBT Rights: Death of David Kato...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are deeply saddened by the murder of David Kato Kisule, yesterday 26 January in Kampala, Uganda. David was a lifelong human rights defender; he will be remembered for his outstandingly brave defense of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people's human rights in Uganda. Our condolences go to David's family and friends.

&lt;p&gt;As Sexual Minorities Uganda's Advocacy Officer, David had come to the European Parliament on several occasions to expose the plight of LGBT people in Uganda, notably in the wake of David Bahati's 'Anti-Homosexuality Bill' (sic). Following the publication of lists of presumed homosexual Ugandans by tabloid Rolling Stone, and subsequent attacks on LGBT activists, David bravely faced the Rolling Stone editors in a lawsuit, obtaining the condemnation of the paper and a strong High Court judgement on the universal right to life and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

Online? Reading a magazine or newspaper? From a comedian? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If that last suggestion sounded a bit off, trust us, it’s not. David Letterman, Jay Leno, Conan O’Brien, Jimmy Fallon, Craig Ferguson, Jimmy Kimmel, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert – these are the comedians who keep you laughing late into the night. And every so often, they are the comedians entertaining you with science. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right, scientists and science-related segments have become part of the late night fare. Last week alone, Craig Ferguson (&lt;i&gt;The Late Late Show&lt;/i&gt;) chatted with Dan Riskin, a bat researcher at the City College of New York and host of the Animal Planet Show &lt;i&gt;Monsters Inside Me&lt;/i&gt;;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Stephen Colbert (&lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt;) invited Sherry Turkle, a sociologist of science and technology, to speak about her latest book &lt;i&gt;Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other&lt;/i&gt;; and Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and host of PBS’s &lt;i&gt;NOVA Science Now&lt;/i&gt;, stopped by &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&lt;/i&gt;. Not too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you want to catch scientists on late night television, there’s a &lt;a href="http://pascophronesis.wordpress.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; tracking appearances each week. Or you could change the channel to Comedy Central – the channel boasts the two best bets to see a scientist: &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt;. Both shows regularly host scientists – especially &lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt;. This week, you can catch two scientists sitting across from Colbert, physicist and noted string theory explainer Brian Greene, as well as professor of psychology (emeritus) at Cornell University, Daryl Bem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists on &lt;i&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/i&gt; are &lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/270038/april-08-2010/neil-degrasse-tyson"&gt;fairly common&lt;/a&gt; – probably due to the shows’ emphasis on current affairs and politics. But what about the more entertainment-based late night talk shows? Science guests and science-related segments aren’t as frequent on other late night talk shows, but they do pop up from time to time. &lt;i&gt;The Late Show with David Letterman &lt;/i&gt;features a recurring segment, Kid Scientists, with students from Naperville, Indiana. The kids demonstrate the latest scientific principles they’ve learned in some very amusing ways (glowing foam!). &lt;i&gt;The Late Show&lt;/i&gt; is also the only talk show to have hosted presidential science adviser John Holdren – not once, but twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O7aMQktHRC0" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Late Late Show&lt;/i&gt; is also in on the science game. Host Craig Ferguson’s fondness for &lt;i&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/i&gt; is well-known – the show’s stars are frequent guests. &lt;i&gt;Mythbuster&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span style="color:black"&gt;Grant Imahara even built Ferguson’s robot skeleton sidekick &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/04/he_has_no_armaments_does_craig.html"&gt;Geoff Peterson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Late Late Show&lt;/i&gt;’s guests in recent months include Mike Massimino, the first astronaut to tweet from space, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer of the &lt;span&gt;Franklin Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in Philadelphia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt; As if that weren’t enough to prove Ferguson’s interest in science, he also devoted an opening monologue to Nobel Prize winners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt;Scientists have also appeared on &lt;i&gt;Conan&lt;/i&gt; (Hubble Fellow Evan Kirby joined O’Brien to promote the show;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:8.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&amp;quot;Verdana&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;color:#2a2a2a"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;physicist and science writer Dr. Michio Kaku appeared as a guest)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:black"&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science Bob&lt;/span&gt;” Pflugfelder &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q4cEbPZHf0"&gt;performed&lt;/a&gt; a science demonstration), and &lt;i&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/i&gt; (Leno hosted kid inventors).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mnjfsm9esrg" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond science guests and science segments, let’s not forget there’s another way &lt;/span&gt;science is promoted on late night television: actors discussing their latest movies. In the past 18 months, the stars of science-based movies such as &lt;i&gt;Creation&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Extraordinary Measures&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Temple&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Grandin&lt;/i&gt; have done the talk show circuit. Audiences may get just a little taste of science from watching actors talk about their movies. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what does it all mean? What do science guests and science segments mean in the larger scheme of things? Is science gaining mainstream popularity? Maybe. But it also says something to the audience – something some people know and some people are just finding out – science is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-3357486696114852697?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ponder, for only a moment, how different your life would be without the geek.  No phones, no roads or cars, no soap, no x-rays, no air-conditioning or heating, no Internet, and no stealth bomber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers are problem-solvers and life-givers.  They spend years studying math and science with the goal of applying that knowledge in the creation of transformative change.  They build new tools and devices that enhance our day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the United States is facing a shortage of engineers.  And that’s a shame, because engineers are needed to fuel economic growth.  Corporations hire engineers to create and bring innovative products to the marketplace.  Engineers also advance national and regional interests like homeland security, healthcare innovation, national defense and space exploration.  These activities all help build the economy and bring more folks to the work place holding meaningful jobs.  In short engineers help build the economy and generate needed tax revenue for governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To agree that the United States needs more engineers is a good first step. But the U.S is ready for the next step.  State legislators and Congressional representatives need to put more funding into supporting engineering education.  That means helping with scholarships for talented students. That means supporting talented faculty.  That means constructing more laboratories and classroom space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once that’s happened America can begin building the next generation of smart phones and telecommunication, the next generation of cars and long-lasting roads, the next generation of energy efficient climate control, innovative medical devices and more.  And if we’re really lucky, the geeks will help us figure out how keep America on the road of economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

There's a BBC News story about it at: &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12240549"&gt;'Life chemicals' may have formed around far-flung star&lt;/a&gt;. The story is reproduced without comment on &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/584794-life-chemicals-may-have-formed-around-far-flung-star"&gt;RichardDawkins.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The press reports refer to an article published in &lt;i&gt;The Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/727/2/L27"&gt;NON-RACEMIC AMINO ACID PRODUCTION BY ULTRAVIOLET IRRADIATION OF ACHIRAL INTERSTELLAR ICE ANALOGS WITH CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT&lt;/a&gt;]. Here's the abstract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The delivery of organic matter to the primitive Earth via comets and meteorites has long been hypothesized to be an important source for prebiotic compounds such as amino acids or their chemical precursors that contributed to the development of prebiotic chemistry leading, on Earth, to the emergence of life. Photochemistry of inter/circumstellar ices around protostellar objects is a potential process leading to complex organic species, although difficult to establish from limited infrared observations only. Here we report the first abiotic cosmic ice simulation experiments that produce species with enantiomeric excesses (e.e.'s). Circularly polarized ultraviolet light (UV-CPL) from a synchrotron source induces asymmetric photochemistry on initially achiral inter/circumstellar ice analogs. Enantioselective multidimensional gas chromatography measurements show significant e.e.'s of up to 1.34% for (13C)-alanine, for which the signs and absolute values are related to the helicity and number of CPL photons per deposited molecule. This result, directly comparable with some L excesses measured in meteorites, supports a scenario in which exogenous delivery of organics displaying a slight L excess, produced in an extraterrestrial environment by an asymmetric astrophysical process, is at the origin of biomolecular asymmetry on Earth. As a consequence, a fraction of the meteoritic organic material consisting of non-racemic compounds may well have been formed outside the solar system. Finally, following this hypothesis, we support the idea that the protosolar nebula has indeed been formed in a region of massive star formation, regions where UV-CPL of the same helicity is actually observed over large spatial areas.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The authors assume that the primodial soup speculation about the origin of life is the most reasonable explanation. According to this widely believed scenario, life originated in a soup of organic molecules that supplied most of the molecules of metabolism such as glucose and amino acids (and nucleotides?). Presumably once life got underway these molecules were used up and only then did metabolic pathways evolve to synthesize these molecules. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The competing hypothesis is Metabolism First [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/metabolism-first-and-origin-of-life.html"&gt;Metabolism First and the Origin of Life&lt;/a&gt;]. In this scenario, the first steps involved the establishment of simple oxidation-reduction reactions across a "membrane" using inorganic molecules. Once this supply of energy was in place the first pathways led to synthesis of simple organic molecules like acetate and glycine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's wrong with the Primordial Soup model? Well, for one thing, it's awfully hard to imagine how incoming asteroids could supply enough material to make a difference. The maximum concentration of all amino acids in the ocean, for example, could never have been more than 10-100 pM and that's optimistic [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/04/can-watery-asteroids-explain-why-life.html"&gt;Can watery asteroids explain why life is 'left-handed'?&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of trying to prove that asteroids could carry a slight excess of L-amino acids, I wish these workers would apply a bit of healthy skepticism to the subsequent steps of the scenario. It's not reasonable to assume that minute quantities of amino acids could ever fuel the origin of life. Incidentally, the Primordial Soup Hypothesis also imagines that early cells used exogenous glucose as a fuel. This implies that the glycolysis pathway is more primitive that the gluconeogenesis pathway for synthesis of glucose. Unfortunately the data disproves this prediction. Gluconeogenesis is more ancient and glycolysis evolved later [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/10/aldolase-in-gluconeogenesis-glycolysis.html"&gt;Aldolase in Gluconeogenesis &amp;amp; Glycolysis&lt;/a&gt;]. A nasty little fact.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real problem is not that metabolism firstists such as Bill Martin are right and soupists are wrong—although that&amp;#39;s a very real possibility. &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TUHV4BMNhDI/AAAAAAAAK8Q/UcR452RughA/s1600/lol.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="width:15px;height:15px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TUHV4BMNhDI/AAAAAAAAK8Q/UcR452RughA/s400/lol.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The problem is that most scientists are not thinking critically about the origin of life. There are several possibilities and none of them are particularly convincing. However, the Primordial Soup Hypothesis has a number of glaring weaknesses that need to be addressed honestly and it doesn't do anyone any good if scientists sweep these weaknesses under the rug.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. We're talking about a primordial soup where the concentration of L-alanine might be 0.50 pM and the concentration of D-alanine might be 0.49 pM. That's supposed to be enough for life based on amino acids to evolve and to lead to the subsequent preference for synthesizing exclusively L-amino acids. How, exactly, does that work?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-5144790889374933826?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296160664195"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=18731">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d71ce24fc38af90a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Science"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Inner, Outer, or All?</title><published>2011-01-27T20:00:16Z</published><updated>2011-01-27T20:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2011/01/ai-inner-outer-or-all/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2044517,00.html?hpt=T2"&gt;recently discovered an ancient galaxy&lt;/a&gt;whose deep red light took 13.2 billion years to reach it. The galaxy — functionally named UDFj-39546284 — is the oldest ever discovered. It was formed just 480 million years after the 13.7 billion year-old universe itself was born, and though it has long since flashed out of existence, the images can teach astronomers a lot about the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m always fascinated by discoveries related to space (planets, stars, galaxies, etc.). I don’t know if it’s because of the enormous size of celestial bodies, the vast distances, or the fact that we can currently only look, but it inspires awe, and gets my imagination going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your preference, if any? Do you get a rush from the grand scale discoveries in space? Are you more in awe of the tiniest particles? Do you gravitate toward Earth science? Are you impressed most by the mysteries of the ocean? Or are you an “across the board” inspiree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate wrote a long letter, the first part of which I am summarizing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was born into a basically non-observant Catholic family. When she began dating her husband-to-be in high school, she was completely uninterested in religion, and he was nominally a Christian. They got along very well, but his parents are very heavily religious. (She did not specify the denomination.) She attended church with them so that they would accept her, and she was accepting and respecting of her husband’s level of involvement as a Christian. Four years ago they married when she was 18 and he 19. Since then, her husband began to lose interest in religion as well.  We pick up the story in her own words at that point: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…He didn’t want to go to church or be around religious people. He didn’t even want to be around his own family because all they talk about is religion or what happened at church the other day. Eventually we stopped going to church all together. We tried and tried to appease his parents by doing what they wished but finally we couldn’t take it anymore. So when we stopped attending completely he was of course confronted by his father. After a big argument his parents finally stopped talking about it, and now it’s like an elephant in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem we are facing though isn’t really with his parents. They just don’t talk about it and pretend that it never really happened. Other members of the church we once attended are becoming “concerned” about us and whether or not we will go to hell. Most of the people at church now think we are Satanists and are very bad people. We aren’t bad people nor are we Satanists. This is just a rumor about us and it is quite hurtful. I am just as moral as I ever was, and I still treat people as I always did. Religion is not a prerequisite for morality as they say. I have done many things for people at church and outside of church in order to help them regardless of my religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that one of the deacons from the church is coming to our house soon to talk to us about our beliefs. He is a very nice man and truly concerned but I don’t know how to handle his questions. How do I handle all of these people and their questions without causing upset or a huge family argument? How can I prove to my husband’s family that I didn’t change him and that he made his own decisions? What should I do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Kate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Kate, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to turn this around. I’m sure that as you say the Deacon is a very nice man, so you’re going to be like iron wrapped in velvet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important that you keep your manner courteous, civil, and businesslike. You will actually have more power and command during the discussion. Frequently take deep, slow breaths to keep your composure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know who arranged the Deacon’s visit, but you should conduct this meeting as if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; called on &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt;  You should take complete charge of the meeting right at the start.  Make sure that your in-laws are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; at this meeting. It should be only you and your husband, with the Deacon by himself. If he shows up with others, you have every right to politely send the others away. You don’t have to give any reason other than that’s what you want. In other words, &lt;em&gt;never allow anyone to gang up on you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be intimidated. He has no authority over you. You’re free of all that. Take written notes of what he says.  That shows him you’re really listening, and you’re going to hold him to his word. Remember that you don’t have to justify yourself to him or anyone else. You have the right to frankly ask him why he’s asking these questions before you even begin responding. If his questions are truly only out of concern for you and your husband, and are only from genuinely wanting to accurately understand you, then politely answer any of them with which you feel comfortable. Label any of his questions that you don’t like as not acceptable, and disregard them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT in any of your answers, do not sound apologetic or contrite for the decisions you and your husband have made.  You don’t have to sound hostile, but don’t sound ashamed either.   Make it clear to him in very assertive terms that neither you nor your husband are bad people or Satanists.  Don’t be embarrassed to say that you are moral, and to describe the good things you have done for your community. Say it matter-of-factly, not sounding like a boast or a defense.  You’ve done nothing wrong, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have. Don’t be on the defensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be well-mannered while doing it, but you should put &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; on the defensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peaceful, relaxed voice, demand that he take decisive and thorough action to put a complete stop to the vicious and ridiculous rumors that have spread through his staff and congregation about you and your husband. Participating in a rumor without checking it out is nothing less than lying, so you’re glad he’s come so he can put an end to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoothly make it clear to him that such ignorant and cruel gossip is disgusting, and that you consider it his responsibility to clean up that filth in his flock. Tell him that tolerating such slanderous “false witness” is very hypocritical of his church and his religion, and it poisons both the spirit of his church and the rest of the community. It’s the kind of lunacy that not very long ago brought people to burn the old woman of the village as a witch. Ask him point-blank if he is willing to tolerate that kind of Dark Age superstition in his church, and if not, then &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what is he going to do about it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insist that he tell the clergy and congregation that you and anyone else should have the complete right and freedom to join or to leave the church, and neither the clerics nor the churchgoers should ever, &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; penalize anyone socially or any other way for deciding what is best for their own lives. That is one of the major reasons why people get fed up with churches, and reacting with more of it only drives them further away.  He should give the assembly some stern sermons about not believing or spreading rumors and about not judging others, and in addition to that, he should give the staff training in challenging and stopping rumors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell him that the most revealing test of how well a Christian has actually adopted the best teachings of Jesus is in how lovingly they treat people who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of their church, and who do not necessarily agree with their views. So far his flock is failing that test very badly. The fact that “nobody’s perfect” is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an excuse for them doing this, or an excuse for him to allow them to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not allow yourself to be sucked into any debate about the existence of God. If he tries to start that, just say “I’m sorry, discussing that is a waste of our time.  I’m concerned about this abuse from your followers in the here and now.” If he asks why don’t you believe, remember you don’t have to justify your lack of belief. In your mind, consider him a salesman who has failed to convince you to buy his product, because he doesn’t have his product to show you, and his sales pitch is full of holes.  If you want to respond at all, just shrug your shoulders, and say that you’ve listened to many people for a long time, and no one has convinced you. Then move back to your demands for him to clean up his church’s act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assure him that while you’re sure he will do these things to be a better steward of the people he’s supposed to be guiding, you will be watching for the results.  Let him finish his tea if he hasn’t already spilled it on himself, thank him for coming, and in the most courtly manner, send him on his way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as for your in-laws, I suspect that they haven’t been quietly “ignoring the elephant in the room.” I suspect that they are at least part of the impetus behind this calumny. The first thing to do is to forget trying to avoid “causing an upset or a huge family argument.” You already had that, and it hasn’t really gone away.  If they want to start another ruckus, make use of their door. If they start a quarrel at your house, show them how to use &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; door. Tell them that when they can act like adults instead of brats, you’ll talk again, &lt;em&gt;maybe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should not have to “prove to your husband’s family that you didn’t change him and that he made his own decisions.” &lt;em&gt;He&lt;/em&gt; should do that, and just like with the Deacon, he should make it clear in a polite but completely non-apologetic way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate, I hope this helps you to feel more confident and assertive. Remember, you’ve done nothing wrong, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; have. Memorize these  basic rights of assertion that pertain to your situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
You have the right to expect respect.&lt;br&gt;
You have the right to act in your own best interest.&lt;br&gt;
You have the right to defend yourself against abuse or aggression.&lt;br&gt;
You have the right to make a request.&lt;br&gt;
You have the right to turn down a request.&lt;br&gt;
You have the right to think about any question before answering. &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you and your husband well. Let us know how it goes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

Apply!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCA Summer 2011 Internship Program&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secular Coalition for America (SCA) is pleased to offer one paid internship position for summer 2011. SCA is seeking a highly motivated undergraduate junior- or senior-level student with a demonstrated interest in being active in the nontheistic movement. The student must live and attend school more than 50 miles outside of the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCA is a 501(c)4 advocacy organization whose purpose is to amplify the diverse and growing voice of the nontheistic community in the United States. Located in Washington, D.C., our staff lobbies U.S. Congress about issues of special concern to our constituency and advocates for the separation of church and state. To learn more about SCA, visit www.secular.org. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internship will provide activities and opportunities to learn about, assist with, and work with the four main areas of SCA's office: lobbying and advocacy, grassroots and outreach, development and fundraising, and media relations and social media networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SCA will provide housing through the Washington Intern Student Housing (WISH) (www.internsdc.com). The intern will be required to share a townhome or apartment with up to three people of the same gender. The group living situation will allow the intern to meet other interns working in D.C. as well as provide social opportunities. WISH provides all housing necessities except a computer, personal items, cell phone, bedding, towels, and clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internship will be a 12-week program and will run from Monday, May 30, 2011, through Friday, August 13, 2011; work hours will generally be Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Occasional weekend and evening hours may be expected. The internship will pay $500/week = $6,000 for the summer (minus required district and federal taxes). Transportation costs to and from Washington, D.C. will not be provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To apply for the SCA Summer 2011 Internship Program, please fill out the following application and send the following documents to internship@secular.org. &lt;/p&gt;

This way, when we are working on something like sheet-rocking the kitchen, patching the bullet hole in the roof of the cabin, or installing the invisible surround sound system there will be a tape measure, a utility knife, and a pencil.  The tape measure tells you where to cut, the pencil marks where you will cut, and the utility knife cuts it. There are lots of other tools involved in carrying out these tasks, but these three are the tools most likely to be stolen by gremlins.  The table saw and the electric drill seem to lack legs, but the tape measure, knife and pencil are temporary visitors on this earth.  Or so it seems. &lt;/p&gt;

How does this affect your writing process? I ran across a study with interesting results.

The researchers wanted to know how computer writing differed from pen and paper writing. They recruited university faculty and graduate students to write two reports, one on a computer and one on pen and paper. The participants were given background information for the reports (about a new system of bank charges and new company regulations) two days beforehand. When they came in for the experiment, they had  three hours to write each report, and the researchers used keystroke tracking and video cameras to record their progress.

Here are some of their observations:

1. The computer writers took half as much time to write the first draft than pen and paper writers.

2. The computer writers wrote texts that were approximately 20% longer. 

3. The computer writers had a more fragmented writing process than the pen and paper writers. They paused more, and more of their pauses were in the middle of a sentence (as opposed to sentence or paragraph boundaries). However, in the instances when pen and paper writers did pause, it was for a longer period of time than the computer writers.

4. Computer writers made 80% of the revisions in their first draft, as compared to pen and paper writers, who made only 50% of revisions in the first draft. Pen and paper writers tended to wait until a draft was complete and then revised systematically from beginning to end. Computer writers revised in smaller chunks throughout the writing process.

The authors observed that pen and paper writing seemed a more systematic and planned out process. This makes sense because it&amp;#39;s harder to make a change on pencil and paper. With computer writing, you can just start writing and make changes as you go along.

After the researchers looked at average behavior of the entire group, they analyzed the writers as individuals. They classified the writers into different writing profiles, including nonstop writers who hardly revised at all, writers who revised more in their first draft, writers who revised more in their second draft, and initial planners who spent a lot of time planning up front but did little revising afterwards.

The researchers found that there was quite a lot of variability between writing styles, even within the same modality (computer/pen). The researchers also found that almost everybody changed their writing style when switching from pen to computer. The participants didn&amp;#39;t all change their writing styles in the same way, but almost all of them did something different. This makes me think that it’s worth experimenting with yourself in different writing modalities, just to see how it affects you personally.

I kind of wish these researchers had to analyzed the final products to see if the modality affected the complexity of the sentence structure or the ideas presented. If anybody knows more about this, please let me know. And also, I wonder how the experiment would look for people using voice recognition software. :-)

Have you  tried experimenting with different writing modalities? How has that worked for you?  Which modality do you prefer?

Luskin then kindly outlines the three steps in constructing a “just so” story to account for biological phenomena.  Here I’ll walk through Casey’s steps for a parallel case to show just how specious his claim is.  The parallel case is accounting for how a particular boulder, indicated below by the red arrow, got to where it was in a landslide (image used by permission of &lt;a href="http://www.air-and-space.com/home.htm" rel="external "&gt;Air-and-Space Museum&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/01/27/Landslide.jpg" alt="Landslide.jpg" width="756" height="501"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luskin’s main complaint about the Cheng, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; paper is that it invokes various processes (&lt;em&gt;known to occur in nature&lt;/em&gt;) to account for the end product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[It claims that] AFPIII evolved from a duplicate copy of another gene in the fish, SAS-B. They summarize their evolutionary story: “AFPIII 5’FR, intron1 (I1), exon2 (E2; icebinding mature AFPIII), and 3’FR were derived from the 5’FR, I5, E6 (SAS C-terminal domain), and 3’FR, respectively, of the ancestral LdSAS-B,” and then “[a]ccelerated adaptive changes subsequently occurred in the nascent AFPIII gene.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gene Evolution Game&lt;/strong&gt;
Sounds simple and compelling, right? Don’t be too impressed. If you go back and read my article, “&lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/02/how_to_play_the_gene_evolution032141.html" rel="external "&gt;How to Play the Gene Evolution Game&lt;/a&gt;,” you’ll find that by using a combination of three magic wands – Gene Duplication, Natural Selection, and Rearrangement – it’s a simple matter to concoct a just-so story to “explain” the origin just about any gene sequence – no details required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me walk through the steps of Luskin’s Game, translating to show how they would operate in the boulder/landslide scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene Evolution Game Rule 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever you find sequence homology between two genes, just invoke a duplication event of some hypothetical, ancient ancestral gene, and you can explain how two different genes came to share their similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the boulder that translates to something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boulder Game Rule 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever you find shape and mineral composition homology between a rock at the bottom of a slope and a ledge up the slope, just invoke a hypothetical breakage event and a hypothetical landslide event and you can explain how the rock and the ledge come to share their similarities in shape and composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we search the cliff above the landslide and find a ledge that has a similar mineral composition and find a portion of the ledge with a physical shape at its edge that’s roughly complementary to the shape of a side of the boulder, we just invoke  hypothetical breakage and landslide events to account for the boulder’s existence and position, using the magic wand of gravity as a natural law in our explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Luskin tells us &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene Evolution Game Rule 2:&lt;/strong&gt; When you need to explain how a gene acquired some new function, or evolved differences from another gene, just invoke the magic wand of natural selection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our boulder example, that translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boulder Game Rule 2:&lt;/strong&gt; When you need to explain how a boulder acquired some nicks and chips or shape differences from the ledge above just invoke the magic wand of collisions with other boulders during the hypothetical landslide.  To account for the driving force that got it to its position at the bottom of the slope just invoke the magic wand of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Luskin’s third rule is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene Evolution Game Rule 3:&lt;/strong&gt; When a gene seems to be composed of the parts of several genes, just invoke duplications and rearrangements of all the DNA sequences you need, so you can get them all together in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That translates to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boulder Game Rule 3:&lt;/strong&gt; When a boulder has surface marks of a different composition than the original ledge, just invoke collisions with boulders of a different composition during the hypothetical landslide to account for the marks, and maybe even find the other boulders that contributed the marks.  Of course you’ll also have to invoke hypothetical friction and hypothetical collisions, along with the magic wand of gravity again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin goes on to critique the paper for not reaching the IDist’s favorite and most distant goalpost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies had identified some of the supposedly “positively selected” amino acids as important to the antifreeze function, the authors make no attempt to provide a step-by-step explanation of how SAS-B’ changed into AFPIII. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is obvious, in Luskin’s twisted world we can’t satisfactorily account for the boulder’s structure, appearance, and position merely by invoking known physical laws (gravity) and processes (rock breakage and collisions and friction).  We have to give a centimeter-by-centimeter, bounce-by-bounce, collision-by-collision description of the descent of that particular boulder before Luskin will believe that the boulder’s source is the ledge above and that its final position and appearance are due to the vicissitudes of boulders tumbling downhill in landslides powered by gravity.  That’s the goalpost Michael Behe and all IDists move to whenever they’re confronted with an account like that in the Cheng, &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; paper or, for that matter, in our landslide example.  For Luskin, the “magic wands” of gravity and the presence of other components of the landslide together with random bounces during a landslide that are no longer accessible to direct inspection cannot explain the position and appearance of the boulder in the image: It’s perfectly obvious that we have to invoke &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/evangelical-scientists-refute-gravity-with-new-int,1778/" rel="external "&gt;Intelligent Falling.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things fall not because they are acted upon by some gravitational force, but because a higher intelligence, ‘God’ if you will, is pushing them down,” said Gabriel Burdett, who holds degrees in education, applied Scripture, and physics from Oral Roberts University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I mean that, I  really do, because there are just too many kids in the mix and this is  just too important and if you are either intellectually too lazy or too  dishonest to understand the science around vaccines and autism, then,  well, you are my enemy. Sorry, it’s a hard knock life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That captures his “Goodfellas” approach quite nicely. If you disagree with him – you are his enemy, the gloves are off, and anything is justified. To add irony to his thuggery, Handley himself is just too intellectually lazy, or (in my opinion) scientifically illiterate to “understand the science around vaccines and autism.” Yet he presumes to lecture those who have dedicated their lives to studying science, and in fact is willing to make them his enemy because they have the audacity to point out that his understanding of science is hopelessly flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/j-b-handley-is-a-libelous-douchebag/"&gt;Skepacabra does a good job &lt;/a&gt;of dissecting this particular piece of propaganda, so I won’t repeat it here. There is one point that Skepacabra did not mention that I would like to focus on, however. Handley massively contradicts himself in the article, in a very telling way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, as a quick reminder – the anti-vaccine crowd initially claimed (sparked by Andrew Wakefield’s flawed and now fraudulent research) that the MMR vaccine caused autism. A series of studies showed that this was incorrect – there is no correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism. So they moved on to thimerosal in some vaccines. A series of studies showed no correlation there either. Most dramatically, thimerosal was removed from the US routine childhood vaccine schedule (except for insignificant trace amounts) by 2002. The anti-vaccinationists predicted autism rates would plummet and they would be vindicated. Well, autism rates continued to increase without any change, demolishing the thimerosal hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the anti-vaccine crowd complained (and JB repeats this here) that scientists have only disproved one vaccine (MMR) and one ingredient (thimerosal) but have never studies vaccines vs a control group of completely unvaccinated. This is supremely disingenuous – scientists disproved the two hypotheses that were raised – MMR and thimerosal. There is no reason to think that any other vaccine or ingredient causes autism, and there is plenty of data to show a lack of correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relates to Handley’s massive self-contradiction. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without a real control group, the conclusions of a study on the potential harm of a drug are 100% useless&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we all just agree on that? If you have a study, and everyone  either gets a whole pill or a half a pill, do you have a control group  to compare the outcome to? Of course you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then shortly after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question #2: If one vaccine can harm some people, do you think six vaccines given at the same time will do more or less harm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, fine, I stacked the decks a bit on #2, but this is a point lost  on many. It’s exceptionally likely that if one vaccine can cause some  harm, six vaccines will cause more harm to more people, the question is  if that harm is exponentially or geometrically greater, and it’s perhaps  the most important question of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the contradiction? Handley’s claim, a standard refrain of the anti-vaccinationists, is that any study that does not have a control group without any vaccines at all is 100% worthless. This is the typical black-and-white thinking of the pseudoscientist or ideologue. Most studies in medicine have limitations. It is difficult to find a perfect study, because of real life limitations. In this case it is unethical to withhold a proven medical intervention, like vaccines, from a control group. So we will never have an experimental study that withholds all vaccines. Handley knows this, so his challenge is little more than a stunt – a convenient bit of denialist propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to focus in on the contradiction – he says falsely that only a vaccine-free control group is of any value. But since this is nonsense. If vaccines (or any specific vaccine or vaccine ingredient) caused autism or increased the risk of autism then we would see many correlations – the risk of autism would be greater after the vaccine rather than before, delaying vaccines would likely reduce the risk, and most importantly there would be a dose-response. The greater the exposure to the vaccine, or vaccines in general, or to the ingredient (like thimerosal) the greater the risk of developing autism. The fact that none of these correlations have been found is powerful evidence (not worthless, as Handley would have you believe) against a vaccine-autism link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley knows this because he admits it a few sentences later. He acknowledged that if vaccines caused harm then 6 vaccines would cause more harm than one (a dose response). It then stands to reason that if a study compared exposure to 6 vaccines in one group to 1 vaccine in a second group the study would find greater harm in the 6 vaccine group. And yet Handley simultaneously maintains that such a study would be 100% worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very basic concept, and yet Handley does not seem to grasp it. Although he does when it is convenient, even though he didn’t just a moment before, apparently. This likely represents the compartmentalization that is typical of ideologues – ideas are kept separate so that they can be used for propaganda purposes as necessary. Honest science requires consilience, transparency, and internal agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley, however, is not an honest and competent broker of scientific information. He is, in my opinion, an incompetent thug.&lt;/p&gt;

The exercise here was to take a “message triangle” (a communication device) about the National Science Foundation and convert it into a written blog post. The NSF triangle that was used is pasted below&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2011"&gt;State of the Union address Tuesda&lt;/a&gt;y, President Obama declared that this is our generation’s “Sputnik moment,” and urged a bold new investment in scientific careers, education, and research. Throughout the speech, the president then highlighted a variety of innovative companies that are using technology to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president didn’t directly discuss the crucial connection between basic, curiosity-driven scientific research on the one hand, and more applied research (leading to new technologies) on the other. This was, after all, the State of the Union, not a wonk fest! But the National Science Foundation epitomizes the importance of basic research in laying the groundwork for economic growth and innovation—and will certainly play a pivotal role in this new technology focused agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSF funds nearly two thirds of all non-life sciences basic research at universities in the U.S. Indeed, it’s the only federal agency that funds all of the scientific disciplines. The agency’s research portfolio thus has unique breadth and depth, meaning that the knowledge it funds has the potential to inspire entrepreneurs and spark innovation in a variety of economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we know that the funding of basic research—which, after all, is intended to enlarge our store of knowledge, not the national GDP—ultimately leads to jobs and the growth of companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, you never know where a particular study will lead, save with the benefit of hindsight. However, if we let history serve as our guide, it becomes clear that much of tomorrow’s economy is being born today in university research labs, as they conduct research funded under NSF grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, who found that advances in knowledge and technology drove more than half of U.S. economic growth during the first half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Indeed, as the National Academy of Sciences has put it (discussing what happened when scientists and engineers learned how to dramatically increase the capacity of the microchip): “It enabled entrepreneurs to replace tape recorders with iPods, maps with GPS, pay phones with cell phones, two-dimensional X-rays with three-dimensional CT scans, paperbacks with electronic books, slide rules with computers, and much, much more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the energy industry to Pharma, it’s not hard to see the close relationship between pure knowledge generation on the one hand, and valuable products and jobs on the other. That’s why our government long ago made a commitment to funding basic research, laying down a baseline of knowledge that innovators could then pick up and run with. First after World War II, and then again after the Soviet launch of Sputnik, we turned to science not only for the purpose of national defense, but to ensure prosperity at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now after the Great Recession, we’re going to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

Our family practitioner's office called me and said a bunch of claims for my wife and my son were denied -- from &lt;i&gt;2009&lt;/i&gt;.  I don't even have the same insurance anymore.  The explanation on the EOB was "do not provide that service", and apparently the insurance company told the provider that I would have to call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I'm fuming of course... I mean, &lt;i&gt;2009&lt;/i&gt;?!  WTF?  Luckily I didn't really have to wait on hold, although, the phone menu wanted to fuck me over, but mercifully I got to a point where I could just mash 0 and get to an operator.  Talked to the person a bit... apparently there were only two "claims" (although the one on my son was apparently a whole bunch of separate claims that got lumped into one or something) that had failed to go through because there was a computer error while the claim was being submitted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, that's it.  A short-term computer glitch.  All that needed to happen was for the insurance company to resend the claim to their computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I have two questions:  What kind of shit-ass IT setup do they have where if there is an intermittent network error while processing a claim -- and it appears to have been internal to the insurance company, no less -- that it requires the intervention of no less than &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; humans in order to recover?  And second, why couldn't the insurance company just work this out with my health care provider?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a perfect world, the system should have recovered automatically.  Transmission error during claim submission?  Okay, retry!  Failing that, it should have been one phone call between my health care provider and my (former!) insurance company.

That is, at an imprinted locus, the maternally inherited allele will have one pattern of epigenetic modifications, while the paternally inherited allele has a different pattern. These differences are first established in the male and female germ lines, when the alleles that will eventually become maternally and paternally derived are in physically different locations. It is not hard to imagine, then, how these differences could be established. One pattern of gene expression in spermatogenesis results in the paternal-specific epigenetic modifications. A different pattern of gene expression in oogenesis results in maternal-specific epigenetic modifications.

But what are these epigenetic modifications, and how do they change the expression pattern of the gene?

There are a number of modifications involved in imprinting, but for the moment, we&amp;#39;re going to focus specifically on the simplest and best-understood mechanism: DNA methylation.

The two horizontal lines in this picture represent the two copies of a gene.  The big, solid box is the part of the gene that actually codes for the protein. The open box is the promoter region, which is the part of the DNA sequence responsible for regulating expression of the gene. The lollipop things indicate DNA methylation on cytosine residues (the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; of the A, C, G, T alphabet that makes up DNA).

In this simplest type of scenario, the DNA sequence in the promoter region binds to a variety of proteins that recruit the molecular machinery that will transcribe the gene, leading eventually to production of the corresponding protein. The addition of methyl groups to the DNA changes its binding properties, so that it no longer binds to this machinery, and that copy of the gene is not transcribed.

If you&amp;#39;re not a molecular biologist, you can think of it like this. The transcription machinery is a bit like a Xerox machine, and the gene is like the master copy of some document. The promoter region is like a lock that has to be unlocked before you can copy this particular document. There are a number of proteins called &amp;quot;transcription factors&amp;quot; that function like a key to this lock. These transcription factors fit nicely on the promoter region, unlocking the gene and resulting in the production of many copies of the gene product.

Adding methylation to the promoter region is a bit like squirting epoxy into the lock. The presence of the methyl groups actually changes the physical shape and chemical properties of the DNA. So, when you try to put the key in, it no longer fits right, and the gene can not be copied.

In the top part, we see the red transcription factor binding to the black promoter region, which will activate transcription from the gene. In the bottom part, methyl (CH3) groups have been chemically added to the promoter region, preventing binding, and thereby preventing transcription.

So, these relatively subtle chemical changes are able to completely alter the functional properties of the gene.

Next time, we&amp;#39;ll talk about how these methylation patterns are maintained through development, and how the two gene copies are able to maintain distinct epigenetic states across multiple rounds of cell division and DNA replication. Make sure to tune in, because it&amp;#39;s really slick!

The two references represent the first proposals that DNA methylation might be the thing that permits the stable transmission of patterns of gene expression across cell divisions.

&lt;p&gt;Ed White, Roger Chaffee, and Gus Grissom didn’t have a chance. 17 seconds after the first yell of &amp;quot;fire!&amp;quot;, they were dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of events and circumstances led to the fire. Perhaps the most famous is the pure oxygen atmosphere used in the capsule during the test. Why did NASA do that?

Their point, of course, was to draw attention to the fact that you really shouldn&amp;#39;t use that method for fMRI. You can read the whole paper here. The Atlantic Salmon who heroically volunteered for the study was no more than a prop. In fact, I believe he ended up getting eaten.But now, a Japanese team have just published a serious paper which actually used fMRI to measure brain activity in some salmon: Olfactory Responses to Natal Stream Water in Sockeye Salmon by BOLD fMRI.How do you scan a fish? Well, like this: A total of 6 fish were scanned. The salmon were immobilized by adding an anaesthetic (eugenol) and a muscle relaxant (gallamine) to their tank of water. Then, they were carefully clamped into place to make sure they really wouldn&amp;#39;t move, while a stream of oxygenated water was pumped through their tank.Apart from that, it was pretty much a routine fMRI scan.Why would you want to scan a fish? This is where the serious science comes in. Salmon are born in rivers but they swim out to live in the ocean once they reach maturity. However, they return to the river to breed. What&amp;#39;s amazing is that salmon will return to the same river that they were born in - even if they have to travel thousands of miles to get there.How they manage this is unclear, but the smell (or maybe taste) of the water from their birth river has long been known to be crucial at least once they&amp;#39;ve reached the right general area (see here for a good overview). Every river contains a unique mixture of chemicals, both natural and artificial (pollutants). Salmon seem to be attracted to whatever chemicals were present in the water when they were young.In this study, the fMRI revealed that relative to pure water, home-stream water activated a part of the salmon&amp;#39;s telencephalon - the most &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; part (in humans, it constitutes the vast majority of the brain; in fish, it&amp;#39;s tiny). By contrast, a control scent (the amino acid L-serine) did not activate this area, even though the concentration of L-serine was far higher than that of anything in the home-stream water. How this happens is unclear, but further studies of the identified telencephalon area ought to shed more light on it.So fishMRI is clearly a fast-developing area of neuroscience. In fact, as this graph shows, it&amp;#39;s enjoying exponential growth and, if current trends continue, could become almost as popular as scanning people...Link: Also blogged at NeuroDojo.Bandoh H, Kida I, &amp;amp; Ueda H (2011).

Ron Hubbard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I was finished researching and writing it, I had second thoughts, and decided for a few days that I would shelve it and not produce it, and said so on Twitter. Predictably, lots of people expressed their desire for me to reverse that decision, or that I had decided I was too afraid of Scientology suing me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the reverse was true. I was afraid that the episode came out sounding too soft on Scientology. I did not want to be perceived as the pro-Scientology guy, and the episode turned out being less interesting than I’d hoped. But I eventually said “What the heck” and produced it anyway.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thus-far-unpopular conclusion can be summed up thus: Despite how shocking Scientology’s brutal treatment is of its live-in members, that’s the lifestyle that works for those people. I’m sure psychologists could go on and on about what kind of personality thrives in an environment that is, at its worst, comparable to Abu Ghraib; but that’s the life they choose, and who am I to begrudge other people to do whatever they want with their lives. Are we now in a society in which everyone is required to conform to some rigid norm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emails and site comments started pouring in fast. The majority have been lists of the worst things Scientology has done, accompanied by comments like “I’m surprised Brian didn’t know about this” (as if my weeks of research missed the most obvious common-knowledge stuff that a cat could find on Wikipedia). The implication of many of the comments is that people are imprisoned against their will. Members of Anonymous have posted that when they protested at a Scientology branch, they were photographed or followed (as if it’s unreasonable to expect to be scrutinized when you put on a mask and go to someone’s home to protest their lifestyle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also sent great lists of lawsuits filed by the church trying to silence its critics, and cases where Scientologists have been found guilty of crimes. Most notably, Operation Snow White, some 35 years ago when Hubbard was still alive, was the largest infiltration of the U.S. government in history when Scientologists took jobs where they had access to destroy IRS and other documents pertaining to Hubbard and Scientology. That’s a crime, and 11 church executives appropriately went to jail. There’s no excuse for that. In this case, Scientology does indeed stand out from any other “church”. This is something I probably shouldn’t have left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I tried to do in my episode, whether this was a good choice or a bad one, was to focus on ordinary Scientologists. Every organization and church in the world has every kind of people in it, including criminals, and I don’t think it’s fair to characterize any group based on the actions of its worst apples. In short, this is the essential reason I didn’t spend time talking about the church’s worst actions. I don’t want to focus only on the rare exceptions, the kids forced unwillingly into the Sea Org by their parents, or overt criminal acts. I could probably do an expose on Sesame Street and uncover some producer’s drug habit. That wouldn’t be a fair treatment either. I wanted to talk about ordinary Scientologists who had nothing to do with Operation Snow White and have never beaten someone with an ax handle, as that’s the largest representative group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis was that people who have the right psychology to want to live a Sea Org lifestyle find their happy place when they’re under psychological pressure. Thus, Scientology must apply that pressure (Scientology and the Sea Org being essentially the same entity). Part of that pressure is making it real. It can’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be threats. So they actually do harass and sue people who leave the church or speak out against it. They actually do barricade them into their rooms. They actually do require them to cut off their family and friends. It’s a twisted dance between narcissists and codependents. To you and I, that’s pretty messed up. For them, it works. This is my own conclusion, and my opinion. Clearly, most disagree with me. But it’s a perspective that I don’t think enough people consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just the Sea Org, the full timers. Most Scientologists are your neighbors down the street, whose expensive auditing sessions fund the Sea Org. I thought I gave the ordinary Scientologists a fair shake in the episode. These include the celebrities you know, the John Travoltas and Tom Cruises, who live regular lives but love what Scientology auditing has done for them. Nobody who’s had a good experience talking through their problems with a therapist, friend, or barber should be surprised that auditing can be a powerful and fulfilling experience. If it wasn’t, Scientology wouldn’t have the income stream that it does. That income stream does indeed exist, and so whether detractors like it or not, ordinary Scientologists are enjoying their auditing, regardless of whether it has any legitimate psychiatric value. I went into this point in detail in my &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4242"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;, so won’t repeat any more of it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, I just wanted to make it a little clearer why I talked about the points that I did, and why I glossed over or omitted other things. No Skeptoid episode pleases everyone. Every week I get “I agree with all your episodes &lt;em&gt;except this one,”&lt;/em&gt; and I’ve gotten at least a fair share of those this week. As I often say, whether I’m right or wrong is not nearly as important as whether I suggest something new for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296145954602"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=216287">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55af85db5cd7039c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><title type="html">With the dreaded V-Day fast approaching, Blisstree wants to</title><published>2011-01-27T15:31:30Z</published><updated>2011-01-27T15:31:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/216287/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the dreaded V-Day fast approaching, Blisstree wants to help you get your sexy on – in the form of a $150 gift certificate from Nautica.&lt;/strong&gt; One lucky fan of &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/blisstree"&gt;Blisstree on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; will win up to &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/become-our-facebook-fan-enter-to-win-150-in-nautica-gear-for-you-and-your-valentine/"&gt;$150 worth of swag from Nautica’s online shop&lt;/a&gt;, which we’ll ship to you before Valentine’s Day.

And they don’t just suffer from  meningitis, either—they’re also targeted by the anti-vaccine movement,  which questions the overall safety and efficacy of the vaccine and  revives the same fears of uncertainty from yesteryear, stymieing efforts to immunize against infection.”&lt;/li&gt;

So now we’re not asking for money — we’re just saying thanks.  (Of course there are always &lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/search.html?max=50"&gt;good projects&lt;/a&gt; looking for donations.)  The best part of the process is the thank-you letters that trickle in from the classes that are helped.  Here are some pictures from a few of those classes, using their new materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=420629"&gt;Ms. D’s classroom in Ohio&lt;/a&gt; bought science fair supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course we want to show love to our gay friends.  But love only goes so far.  I knew of a guy who came out as gay. His parents supported his decision.  And then he died.  Because of homosexual AIDS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story?  Christians need to stop “accepting” gay people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=pGxf25AuJr4#"&gt;see it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="550" height="442" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pGxf25AuJr4" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good to see Christian kindness is still alive and well…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really need any more proof that religion is harmful? It has convinced McDowell that loving a child is dependent on him having a relationship with only a certain subset of people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="http://www.jesusneedsnewpr.net/update-sean-mcdowells-complete-answer/"&gt;little more to that clip&lt;/a&gt; than what you see — but McDowell doesn’t sound any better in the additional time.  He says we must stand in “patient but loving opposition” to people we care about when they make bad choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if being gay was “bad” or a “choice.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s wrong on both counts and he comes off like a completely ignorant jackass in this clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christian church has no clue what it’s talking about when it comes to homosexuality.  They’d be wise to not speak about it at all, but we know that’s not going to happen.  They’ll keep talking, providing us with all the sound bytes we’ll ever need to use against them in the future when homosexuality is fully accepted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how anyone who knows a gay person could stand to be part of such a hateful organization.  They should be ashamed of how the church treats the GLBT community.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the first segment of a two-parter about food and food science; it's also about why we eat what we eat, and how that may change in the future. The first episode takes a look at the "molecular gastronomy" movement, which gets a big bump in visibility next month with the publication of a mammoth cookbook called Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking. Its principal author is Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer of Microsoft who now runs an invention company called Intellectual Ventures.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/rzC5Q-3aB34" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEPHEN J.

On a journal article. My very first. It’s with Martin Bridgstock, my dear friend and author of ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Belief-Skepticism-Science-Paranormal/dp/0521758939/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1296143673&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal&lt;/a&gt;‘ &lt;/em&gt;and my supervisor at UWA, Ida Marais. I’m proud of the chance to work with them and proud this result, for several reasons.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Wiseman and Watt’s short scales of positive and negative superstitions have attracted attention in the literature. Using a representative survey of the Australian state of Queensland, the six scale items were applied to 1243 respondents. Initial investigation using Cronbach’s alpha showed that one of the scales did not function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;A factor analysis suggested that a four-item and a two-item scale best fitted the data. A Rasch analysis of all the items confirmed this, and showed that the conventional five-category response format was not appropriate, and that three categories fit the data better. The main conclusion is that the results do not support the Wiseman–Watt theory of three positive and three negative superstitions. It does not seem advisable to use these scales without substantial reformulation and re-testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Superstition; Factor analysis; Rasch model; Positive superstitious beliefs; Negative superstitious beliefs; Scaling; Luck; Item response theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I’m not holding my breath for a response in anyone in particular or even acknowledgment in the slightest. Nor am I expecting that this is going to change anything in my everyday life. But I’m still proud, for myself, for contributing something – even though there’s been some time over the past year where it felt like I was being told I was the complete opposite and should just crawl away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my thesis. I have this. I have real people who supported me throughout who show me what it means to stay tenacious and stick to questioning and not backing down when I was told that it was somehow ‘dominant’ or ‘wrong’ to do so. This kind of work shows why we should question and demand revision and reflection, and insist on improvement. To not do so is to hinder progress.

Located in South Dakota, it’s in a national park and a big tourist attraction (and the scene of the finale of &amp;quot;North by Northwest&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But did you know it’s evidence that man was intelligently designed? Well, it’s certainly used that way by creationists proponents of Intelligent Design; no less a leading light of ID than William Dembski &lt;a href="http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.08.Encyc_of_Relig.htm"&gt;has used Mt. Rushmore as an example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intelligent design begins with a seemingly innocuous question: Can objects, even if nothing is known about how they arose, exhibit features that reliably signal the action of an intelligent cause? To see what’s at stake, consider Mount Rushmore. The evidence for Mount Rushmore’s design is direct—eyewitnesses saw the sculptor Gutzon Borglum spend the better part of his life designing and building this structure. But what if there were no direct evidence for Mount Rushmore’s design? What if humans went extinct and aliens, visiting the earth, discovered Mount Rushmore in substantially the same condition as it is now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess it depends if ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/3i00hd7iomquf4dkhramao81dk/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fbadastronomy%2F2011%2F01%2F27%2Frushmore-doubt-less%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~4/6jzPyVL3KRQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296139161151"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=50743">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16718a3aee7474df</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="investing"/><category term="Paul Samuelson"/><title type="html">How Paul Samuelson Really Got Rich</title><published>2011-01-27T14:31:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-27T14:31:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/SCxutyfTa8o/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/how-paul-samuelson-really-got-rich/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Over at Economic Principals, David Warsh reveals little-known facts about Paul Samuelson's acuity as an investor and his involvement in an early hedge fund called Commodities Corp.: "Long famous for the fortune that his pioneering textbook earned him after 1948, it turns out that Samuelson may have made more money as an investor than as an author.

And that future seems prosperous, with a strong pro-business environment fostered by a government that would do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; to help a millionaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why don't I want to live in that future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;a href="http://www.miller-mccune.com/health/texas-children-canaries-in-the-coal-mine-27640/"&gt;the price Texas pays to prop up business is paid for with the dreams of children&lt;/a&gt;. Happy corporate income reports are gouged out of the next generation's potential for prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A sick, uneducated, unskilled work force does not propel a state forward," Garcia writes in the report's preface. "The devastating forecasts depict a Texas that few of us would want to visit, let alone call home."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The bi-annual Texas legislative session opened this month to news of an estimated $27 billion budget shortfall. But even before legislators took their seats in the capitol, Texas lagged every other state in per-capita spending. Before considering budget-cutting proposals, Texas also ranked 50th among states in health care coverage for children, mental health services for children with diagnosed challenges, preventing childhood homelessness, preventing childhood food insecurity, and preventing obesity among adolescent girls, according to the report.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The cumulative impact of previous budget cuts has put Texas children behind the rest of the nation. When compared to children in the rest of the U.S., a Texas child is 93 percent more likely not to have access to health care, 33 percent more likely not to receive mental health care services, 35 percent more likely to grow up poor, and 16 percent more likely to drop out of school. Given that Texas is not a poor state — its citizens&amp;#39; median wealth ranks 27th out of 50 — the dire status of its children is all the more startling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Texas ranks third among the seven worst states in overall child well-being, according to the advocacy organization Every Child Matters; the other six states are the nation's poorest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the area of child protection — a fundamental measurement of child well-being — Texas ranks last again. In the last decade, more children in Texas than in any other state have died as a result of abuse or neglect. The state invests far less in prevention than it does in child welfare services, which are provided after the abuse or neglect has been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm glad to hear your banks are doing well, Texas; it's too bad the kids are dying or lacking education, and that your economic well-being isn't benefiting the actual people living in your state, but if the blood and sweat of of the people is needed to grease the Happy Fun Slide of bidness, well, that's what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re awake, go look!  I’ll keep the site visible on my spare  laptop much of today and post here with the time (EST) when I see  eagles.  Check back from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;6:52 AM EST: EAGLES: &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; of them! What magnificent  birds!  One of them is bringing sticks to the nest, which is obviously  still being built.  Eggs and chicks to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:54 AM EST: Both eagles still there; they’re building the nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9:00 AM EST: Eagles out hunting or looking for sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oops!  Sorry; I accidentally trashed the comments along with the  earlier post, since I wanted to keep the eagles at the top.  Do repost  if you had a comment that’s germane.  I’ll keep &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; post and comments up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;11:00 AM EST: The pair back in the nest, engaged in more twig-fiddling.  Many of us are starting to realize how hard it is to build a good nest!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find information about bald eagle nests &lt;a href="http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/eagle/NestAbout1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Among the tidbits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all birds in the world, Bald Eagles hold the record for the biggest nest ever built. One nest in Florida was 6.1 meters deep, 2.9 meters wide, and weighed 2,722 kg (almost 3 tons). Could a Bald Eagle nest this size fit in your classroom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a pair of Bald Eagles possibly build that huge nest and still have time to lay eggs, incubate them, and raise the babies in a single breeding season?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, they don’t! Throughout the season, and sometimes even during fall and winter, eagles keep adding sticks to the nest, and they reuse nests, continuing to build on to them, for many years. That huge record-breaking nest in Florida was the largest nest ever found, and it was very old. The average eagle nest is only 1.5-1.8 meters in diameter and 0.7-1.2 meters tall, and the first year a nest is built, it may be much smaller than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most regions, a pair of eagles starts working on their nest from 1 to 3 months before the female lays the first egg. However, in the northern regions they can’t delay this long. For example, according to Birds of North America, “In Saskatchewan, adults build or repair nests in September prior to migration and build or repair nests in April upon return from wintering grounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:00 PM EST:  One eagle in the nest, just chillin’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:05 PM EST:  &lt;strong&gt;HEY!  No more eagles until you read your &lt;em&gt;biology&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:34 PM EST:    Il n’y a aucun aigle&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:00 PM EST:    One eagle recumbent.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is even cooler is that the author of the earlier paper was Vladimir Nabokov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Nabokov (1899-1977) as a famous writer, author of, among other books, &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pnin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Speak, Memory&lt;/em&gt;.  He also taught literature at Cornell from 1948 to 1959; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Literature-Vladimir-Nabokov/dp/0156027755"&gt;his classroom lectures have been published&lt;/a&gt; and they are absolutely superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what you probably didn’t know was that he was also &lt;a href="http://www.fathom.com/course/10701032/session4.html"&gt;a world-class lepidopterist,&lt;/a&gt; specializing in the “alpha taxonomy” (description and publication of new species) of butterflies.  From 1945-1948 he was Curator of Lepidoptera at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), the institution where I got my Ph.D.  If you read his novels, you’ll often find a mention of butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Nabokov at the MCZ in 1945, from &lt;a href="http://www.fathom.com/course/10701032/session4.html"&gt;the article on his butterfly work&lt;/a&gt; at the New York Public Library Site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nabokov’s speciality was the butterfly subfamily Polyommatinae (called “blues” because of their color) in the family Lycaenidae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27292" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/nabokov-was-right-all-along/800px-lycaeides_melissa_samuelis_cropped/"&gt;&lt;img title="800px-Lycaeides_melissa_samuelis_(cropped)" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/800px-lycaeides_melissa_samuelis_cropped.jpg?w=415&amp;amp;h=294" alt="" width="415" height="294"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1945 Nabokov published a formal description and revision of some lycaenid butterfies in &lt;a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/psyche/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psyche&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Cambridge Entomological Club (I’m a member!).  Here’s the title of his paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27289" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/nabokov-was-right-all-along/nabokov-paper/"&gt;&lt;img title="Nabokov paper" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/nabokov-paper.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=230" alt="" width="500" height="230"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The paper is long (62 pages), and largely devoted to describing species based on their genitalia, the character that seems to evolve most rapidly among insects—and many other groups, probably because of sexual selection (see William Eberhard’s excellent&lt;em&gt; Sexual Selection and Animal Genitalia)&lt;/em&gt;.  At the end of the paper he speculates, based on the morphology of the various species, that the “blues” arrived in the New World from Asia over the Bering Strait.  He further speculated that there were actually five successive invasions from Asia, each giving rise to a different New World group.  And the first invasion produced species that made it to Central and South America, with the North American representatives eventually becoming extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of investigators from a bunch of places, led by my friend Naomi Pierce at Harvard, just tested Nabokov’s theory with the modern tools of molecular biology and systematics.  Their results, published in &lt;a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/01/25/rspb.2010.2213.full?sid=2fee48fe-a9fb-4785-a0ef-73f1c3f818f5"&gt;a paper in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (free access!) and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/science/01butterfly.html?hpw"&gt;described by Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; in yesterday’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, show that Nabokov was right on all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the authors found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using six genes, they made a molecular phylogeny of 73 species of blues from all five “sections” described by Nabokov.  This analysis showed that, indeed, the five separate invasions posited by Nabokov each produced a monophyletic group (i.e., a group descended from a single ancestral species). The butterflies also descended, as Nabokov posited, from Asian ancestors, and certainly came to the New World by migration over the Bering Strait.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The oldest group was, as Nabokov suggested, the butterflies in the neotropics: Central and South America.  The other groups were younger, and &lt;em&gt;in the precise age sequence that Nabokov posited had arrived from Asia&lt;/em&gt; (and then radiated in North America).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The branches of the phylogeny were dated using a “molecular clock.” They were found to have begun about 11 million years ago, and continued until about 1 million years ago.  During the earliest part of that period the Bering Strait was not continuous between Asia and North America, and so some of the ancestral blues must have crossed an expanse of ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authors then determined the temperature-tolerance ranges of each group based on the climate where its members are now living.  From that, they reconstructed the temperature tolerance of each group’s ancestors. (You can do this for any measurable trait, morphological or physiological, using a method called “ancestral character state reconstruction”.)  And they found that the temperatures tolerated by each successive invader declined over time.  The earliest invader tolerated higher temperatures than the next, and so on for all five invasions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spiffy result: the temperature tolerances posited for each ancestor matched very nicely the temperatures thought to have prevailed in “Beringia” (the region on either side of the Bering Strait) at the time of the invasions.  Here’s part of the authors’ Figure 1, showing the temperature tolerances of ancestors during each of the five invasions (vertical bars), and the temperatures posited to have existed in Beringia, all over the 11 million years from the first to the last invasion:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27329" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/nabokov-was-right-all-along/picture-2/"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27359" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/nabokov-was-right-all-along/picture-1/"&gt;&lt;img title="Picture 1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/picture-1.png?w=481&amp;amp;h=299" alt="" width="481" height="299"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;Note the good match between the actual temperatures in Beringia and the temperatures tolerated by the ancestral invader of each of the five groups.  Clearly, the butterflies now in the neotropics tolerated high but not low temperatures, and so were likely driven to the south as the climate became colder.  This also implies that each group has pretty much retained the ancestral temperature tolerance of its ancestor, though the ancestral five groups did diverge from one another in tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lovely piece of work, and how nice that the modern work, using all the highfalutin tools of molecular biology, systematics, ancestral state reconstruction, and so on, managed to confirm the speculations of one itinerant zoologist/author equipped only with a microscope and a bunch of butterfly genitals!&lt;/p&gt;

Alternative splicing shows up and reminds us that there is so much yet to learn, even about a gene as well-studied as formin.  Genes get transcribed into RNA, which gets translated into proteins.  After transcription of a gene, different regions of RNA called exons and introns are either connected together (exons) or removed (introns) in a process called splicing.  Some genes undergo a process called “alternative splicing” that allows one single gene the ability to splice, or connect, the exons in multiple ways that result in different protein isoforms.  A recent paper describes a previously-unidentified isoform of FHOD3 formin, an actin-nucleating protein found at high levels in the heart.  This new isoform includes an alternative exon in certain muscle tissues, and this exon contains a phosphorylation site that allows an additional level of regulation of FHOD3.  Images above are of neonatal rat heart cells with or without this alternative exon.  The presence of the alternative exon (bottom cell) directs formin (left images, green in merged) to myofibrils (middle images, red in merged), which are the repetitive and contractile structures in muscle cells.  Without the alternative exon, formin is found in aggregates in the cytoplasm (top cell).Iskratsch, T., Lange, S., Dwyer, J., Kho, A., Remedios, C., &amp;amp; Ehler, E. (2010).

&lt;p&gt;European veterinary groups have long been more skeptical about “alternative” veterinary practices than their American counterparts.  For example, the European Board of Veterinary Specialties refuses to grant continuing education credits for non-scientific endeavors attempting to masquerade as a way to improve one’s clinical knowledge, and the practice of veterinary homeopathy is forbidden in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes good news (for pets, and pet owners), out of the UK.  In an effort to improve animal health and welfare, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate’s (VMD) &lt;a href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/news/2010/12/17/pet-remedies/"&gt;has targeted “alternative” remedies&lt;/a&gt;, which, of course, pose both real and potential dangers to pets.  The VMD is the body responsible for the authorization of veterinary medicinal products in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the VMD is targeting a number of unauthorized products that lack scientific proof of effectiveness, including:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homeopathic “nosodes” (substances that are the homeopathic equivalent of vaccination, with the notable exception being that they don’t work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;various herbal products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“neutraceuticals,” the cleverly coined combination of “nutrition” and “pharmaceutical,” which really aren’t either, a fact which, of course, hasn’t dented their popularity, nor dampened their claims (including improved mental ability in pets) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Herbal deworming products, which may claim to irritate the bowel and make it less inviting for parasites (an absurd claim)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving a pet an ineffective remedy invites direct harm, if a sick animal is treated with an ineffective remedy, as well as indirect harm, if an effective therapy is avoided in favor of the heavily advertised ineffective one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director of Operations of the VMD, John FitzGerald, said, “Animal owners have a right to know if a product does what it claims. The products claim to treat diseases which can cause serious welfare problems and in some circumstances kill animals if not properly treated. So in some cases owners are giving remedies to their pets which don’t treat the problem.”  British Veterinary Association President Harvey Locke, in support of the VMD, noted, “As veterinary surgeons we rely on the use of safe, effective and quality medicines for the health and welfare of animals under our care – and there must always be sound scientific evidence to back up medicinal claims made by the manufacturer of any product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VMD intends to contact manufacturers of “alternative” products to make sure that they are safe, and provide the claimed benefits.  If they don’t (which they won’t), the VMD will make the manufacturers rebrand the products so that consumers will know that the products are not medicinal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one might legitimately ask, “Why don’t the US veterinary authorities and organizations take some action such as this?”  Well, in my opinion, veterinary authorities are more interested in getting animals to be treated by veterinarians than they are in the particular remedies that are being used.  So far, in the US, it’s been a triumph of economics over science.  How long that stance holds up, particularly in light of the legitimate strides at curbing non-scientific practices in other countries, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s an ugly place where the dreams of the Christian right are actually being realized, but of course our evangelical leaders are denying their responsibility. Just last night on CNN I caught a bit of a nauseating interview with Joel Osteen, the smirking prosperity gospel pitchman, and he came right out and smilingly declared homosexuality a sin…but his wife just loves Elton John, so it&amp;#39;s all OK. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/30/rick-warren-refuses-to-co_n_373605.html"&gt;Rick Warren is also similarly a moral coward who will happily trigger the landslide, but refuses to involve himself in the consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Warren won't go so far as to condemn the legislation itself. A request for a broader reaction to the proposed Ugandan anti-homosexual laws generated this response: "The fundamental dignity of every person, our right to be free, and the freedom to make moral choices are gifts endowed by God, our creator. However, it is not my personal calling as a pastor in America to comment or interfere in the political process of other nations." On Meet the Press this morning, he reiterated this neutral stance in a different context: "As a pastor, my job is to encourage, to support. I never take sides." Warren did say he believed that abortion was "a holocaust." He knows as well as anyone that in a case of great wrong, taking sides is an important thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our good, kind, sinner-loving, sin-hating Christianist monsters have more blood on their hands now. &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12295718"&gt;David Kato, a Ugandan civil rights leader who fought for tolerance for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered people, has been beaten to death&lt;/a&gt;. This event followed after many death threats, and after the &lt;a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/27/uganda-promptly-investigate-killing-prominent-lgbt-activist"&gt;publication of a hit list in a local magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight against the bill has also pushed Ugandan activists to the fore, raising concern for their privacy and safety. These deepened in late 2010 when a local tabloid called Rolling Stone, unconnected to the US magazine, published pictures, names, and residence locations of some members of the LGBT community, along with a headline saying, "Hang Them." Kato's photo appeared on the cover, and inside another photo appeared with his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple  religious certainty and an atmosphere in which religious leaders are assuring everyone that certain people are less than human, damned, or criminal, and this is what you get: vigilante injustice. And Uganda loses another force for justice and humanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/a_death_in_uganda.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/dEZKLhMFY2g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296134812694"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2011/01/recent_archaeomags_7.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/38fb0e4e0d8c1e3b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Recent Archaeomags</title><published>2011-01-27T13:20:59Z</published><updated>2011-01-27T13:20:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/ZzwBLLaChFA/recent_archaeomags_7.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2011/01/recent_archaeomags_7.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/issues/ca250.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2011/01/recent_archaeomags_7/CA250_Cover.jpg" alt="CA250_Cover.jpg" height="409" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm very pleased to have made it back onto the courtesy subscription list of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/"&gt;Current Archaeology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is a popular zine about UK archaeology. Not only does it  offer good writing and photography, but it covers an area whose archaeology is actually relevant to what I do. Not too many millennia ago you could walk a straight dry-shod line from Gothenburg to Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I recently received&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/issues/ca250.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Archaeology&lt;/em&gt; #250&lt;/a&gt;, whose cover story is a collection of attempts to look in a positive light at the future of UK archaeology after radical public spending cuts. These were occasioned by two unfortunate things that hit the UK at the same time: a severe economic recession and a Conservative government. To me, the most interesting voices in the &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/after-the-cuts-scorched-earth-or-clean-slate.htm"&gt;ten-page story&lt;/a&gt; are those of my Leftie radical colleague &lt;a href="http://www.neilfaulkner.org.uk/"&gt;Neil Faulkner&lt;/a&gt; who calls for revolutionary resistance against the cuts, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Mitford,_6th_Baron_Redesdale"&gt;Lord Rupert Redesdale&lt;/a&gt;, MP for the Liberal Democrats and known for his Green opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redesdale first appeared on my radar as author of the preface to the 2009 volume &lt;em&gt;Metal Detecting and Archaeology&lt;/em&gt; (which I &lt;a href="http://fornvannen.se/pdf/2000talet/2009_litt_c.pdf"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt;), where he draws an interesting parallel: the UK's amateur metal detectorists are a semi-rural cultural resistance movement against the central authorities of the same kind as, though less posh than, the fox-hunting crowd. Redesdale is chairman of England's &lt;a href="http://www.appag.org.uk/"&gt;All Party Parliamentary Archaeology Group&lt;/a&gt;, and I can only wish that Sweden had politicians who cared enough about my subject to form a similar work group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share a number of views with this member of the UK government, regarding archaeological hedonism and the prime importance of not losing sight of who the target audience is. &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/after-the-cuts-scorched-earth-or-clean-slate.htm"&gt;Writes Redesdale&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is still enormous interest in archaeology, as is shown by the large numbers of students who have taken archaeology degrees over the last two decades. However, there are few jobs in archaeology and much of the archaeological work undertaken is in the realm of the developers. There has been a major failure in making local people aware of what has been learnt from the thousands of digs that have been undertaken, and how it could enrich their sense of place in the local community: the real crux of why archaeology is being hit so hard. Local people have been disenfranchised by a profession that should be based on disseminating local information. The tens of millions of pounds that has been spent on archaeology in London alone, which has generated vast reams of grey literature (which almost no one has read), is a massive failure that lies squarely with the archaeological community.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present cuts, whilst devastating in their impact, could give the impetus for the industry to change direction. What is the purpose of archaeology, if not to excite and promote wonder at the rich and varied landscape in which we live? We cannot rely on academic theses to be the only product, if we want local communities to devote scarce resources to preserving our heritage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights of this &lt;i&gt;CA&lt;/i&gt; issue are eight pages on the Gristhorpe Early Bronze Age oak-log inhumation (the academic treatment of which &lt;a href="http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/084/ant0840796.htm"&gt;appeared in &lt;i&gt;Antiquity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the &lt;i&gt;CA&lt;/i&gt; piece) and five pages on richly furnished Roman burials at Hungate in York.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://skalk.dk/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Skalk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another&lt;/b&gt; pop-sci magazine with great writing, great images and coverage of an area that interests me: &lt;i&gt;yndige&lt;/i&gt; Denmark. The December issue was yet another example of something I've complained about in the past: not enough archaeology. After eight pages of Late Palaeolithic arrow-shaft sanders and Medieval churches with skull niches, &lt;i&gt;Skalk&lt;/i&gt; moves on to 20 pages of written Danish history. I read it all with some interest, but I do prefer news about the country's stellar archaeological record. In fact, if Sweden has something cool in archaeology, Denmark always has even cooler and more plentiful examples of it. And when Sweden has something that Denmark does not have, then it's pretty much a boring elk-trapping pit. I wish I had a job at Moesgård.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The summer issue&lt;/b&gt; for 2010 of &lt;a href="http://www.cdarc.org/what-we-do/information-resources/archaeology-southwest/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Archaeology Southwest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in Tucson, Arizona, recently reached subscribers. The theme of the issue is "social identity in the Northern San Juan", an arid area full of of pueblo sites in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners"&gt;Four Corners region&lt;/a&gt; (mainly in Utah and Colorado). Interesting stuff and highly exotic to an ignorant Scandy like myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Archaeology Magazine's&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.org/1101/"&gt;Jan/Feb issue&lt;/a&gt; has a piece on an amendment to the NAGPRA federal repatriation law. I may want to write a separate entry on this as I, being a citizen of the world and a lover of science, absolutely loathe reburial, particularly on nationalistic grounds. I don't care if you're a Swede, a Sioux, a Jew or a gnu, you do not have greater right than anybody else to the archaeological record - even if somebody did commit atrocities against your great grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature piece on rock art at Djulirri in northern Australia is really interesting as the site has lots of "contact art": aboriginal people painting various overseas ships and people that they have come into contact with over the centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In other news,&lt;/b&gt; I was very pleased to receive a call this morning from the National Heritage Board. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/12/swedish_cabinet_opens_door_to.php"&gt;As reported here recently&lt;/a&gt;, Swedish metal-detector legislation is likely to see an overhaul soon. I have now been invited along with several well-known colleagues to speak at a hearing on the subject. I was also asked to help find a good Swedish amateur detectorist who would be willing to give a talk. Maybe I should offer the participants to write guest entries here afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

If there's a show that has the second-widest reach when it abuses science-based medicine, arguably it's Dr. Mehmet Oz's show. Whether it be his recent show featuring quackmaster supreme, Joseph Mercola, or his upcoming show featuring a faith healer, I fear that Dr. Oz has given up whatever claim he once had to promoting science-based medicine. Yes, it's true that he has had a soft spot for reiki for a long time, but other than that he's generally remained mostly science-based; that is, until recently. For instance, last year he admitted that his children &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/01/regarding_dr_mehmet_oz_whoops_maybe_i_sp.php"&gt;had not been vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; for H1N1 and showed a bit too much credulity to potential claims of vaccine injury than the actual evidence demonstrate. Then, a mere two weeks ago, he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/dr_oz_finally_unequivocally_embraces_the.php"&gt;featured Joe Mercola on his show&lt;/a&gt;--defended him, even--and his unfounded claims, ignoring Mercola's long history of support for the rankest quackery. Next week, assuming the schedule hasn't changed, Dr. Oz will &lt;a href="http://www.drozfans.com/dr-ozs-advice/dr-oz-dr-issam-nemeh-is-this-man-a-faith-healer-or-not/"&gt;feature Issam Nemeh, a faith healer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr Issam Nemeh is called a Faith Healer, but is he (or anyone for that matter) really a Faith Healer?  Is there such a thing?  A Faith Healer is said to be a person who helps to cure people of medical issues or other trouble through prayer and faith.  Dr Oz's segment will show two people who Dr Nemeh has "cured," including one woman who Dr Nemeh cured of Lung Cancer.  If you were one of the lucky people to already see this episode of Dr Oz, please leave a comment below to fill us in on what was said and if you believe that Dr Neme is really a Faith Healer or not!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably figured out, this does not sound good at all. I might have to blog it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be getting even worse, though. Bubbling up through the underground, I've gotten wind of an e-mail showing up on various anti-vaccine discussion forums, being passed around from parent to parent, from discussion group to discussion group. I've had it forwarded to me from at least three different sources now, and I've now seen it on at least two anti-vaccine groups, one an autism biomed group and another a more general group. Most recently, I saw it being forwarded by anti-vaccine homeopathy Sherri Nakken. For a show that will be taped on February 8, the producers of The Dr. Oz Show are apparently going to be doing a show about autism:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/dr_oz_looking_for_parents_afraid_of_auti.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/dr_oz_looking_for_parents_afraid_of_auti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/rpra5RKLnOM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296133950196"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2011://2.4860">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f4e426a8ca8136c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="ID/Creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Casey Luskin Has Come Unstuck In Time</title><published>2011-01-27T13:05:11Z</published><updated>2011-01-27T19:36:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2011/01/casey-luskin-ha.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casey Luskin takes note of the Elsberry and Shallit essay in &lt;em&gt;Synthese&lt;/em&gt; 2011/01 in this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I would have hoped that if Weber, a biochemist, was going to refute intelligent design, he would have provided more detail. Weber might protest that such an argument would be more appropriate to make in a scientific journal rather than a philosophy journal. What are we to make, then, of the fact that Wesley Elsberry and Jeffrey Shallit have a technical and scientific response to William Dembski in the issue of Synthese?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Elsberry and Shallit have a sophisticated but extremely out-of-date contribution in the issue which seems based upon their old 2003 article, “Information Theory, Evolutionary Computation, and Dembski’s Complex Specified Information.” In fact, their piece in Synthese has exactly the same title as that old piece. This out-of-date paper has only one citation post 2004, and it isn’t to a paper that deals with the work of Dembski. In terms of their citations to Dembski’s work, their latest citation is 2004, despite the fact that Dembski has published &lt;a href="http://evoinfo.org/publications/" rel="external "&gt;multiple peer-reviewed papers in recent years&lt;/a&gt; studying the origin of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/a1l08u041t72m227/" rel="external "&gt;submitted our essay to Synthese on 2009/03/23&lt;/a&gt;. It was released online by 2009/04/20. It appears in print in the January 2011 issue. In general, authors can only respond to papers that are published &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the date of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at the list of “peer-reviewed papers in recent years” that Casey says shows that we weren’t keeping up with Dembski. I’ve scraped these from the linked page and added dates and elapsed time values from our essay submission date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernoulli’s Principle of Insufficient Reason and Conservation of Information in Computer Search&lt;br&gt;  William A. Dembski and Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published 2009/10, 6 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservation of Information in Search: Measuring the Cost of Success&lt;br&gt;  William A. Dembski and Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published 2009/09, 6 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIFE’S CONSERVATION LAW: Why Darwinian Evolution Cannot Create Biological Information &lt;br&gt;William A. Dembski and Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published 2009/06/16, 2.5 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Search for a Search: Measuring the Information Cost of Higher Level Search &lt;br&gt; William A. Dembski and Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published 2010/04/01, 12 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efficient Per Query Information Extraction from a Hamming Oracle [with Erratum] &lt;br&gt; Winston Ewert, George Montañez, William A. Dembski, Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference held 2010/03/07-09, 11 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary Synthesis of Nand Logic: Dissecting a Digital Organism  &lt;br&gt;Winston Ewert, William A. Dembski and Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published 2009/10, 6 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Vivisection of the ev Computer Organism: Identifying Sources of Active Information  &lt;br&gt;George Montañez, Winston Ewert, William A. Dembski, Robert J. Marks II  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published 2010, at least 8 months after our submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a one of the linked papers Casey referred to was published prior to our essay’s submission. Casey obviously expects critics either to shut up entirely or to be clairvoyant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that the papers Casey &lt;em&gt;erroneously&lt;/em&gt; cites aren’t delivering modifications of Dembski’s “complex specified information” concept. Nor do they set aside any of the concerns we raised about Dembski’s earlier outings in critiquing evolutionary computation. Quite the contrary, Dembski has elaborated his “probability amplifier” tosh into what he now calls “active information”. If Casey believes that an argument of ours would be significantly affected by something presented in those papers, he is welcome to be specific: identify &lt;strong&gt;which&lt;/strong&gt; argument of ours he thinks is affected, and &lt;strong&gt;which&lt;/strong&gt; part of the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; recent papers bears upon it, and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it actually relates to our argument.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, trying to claim that an essay should cite papers published &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; its submission is simply the level of argument we’ve come to expect from Casey Luskin. Coming unstuck in time may happen to Casey, but the rest of us have to experience things sequentially as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

Exactly what, if anything, can the reality show Big Brother tell us about language change over time?Voice Onset Time is a measure of how long you wait to begin vibrating your vocal folds after you release a stop consonant. Voiced stop consonants like /b/ and /d/ require two things: 1) stop all airflow from escaping the airway by closing the glottis and 2) after the air is released, begin vibrating the glottis (by using the rushing air). For non-linguists, think of a garden hose. Imagine you use your thumb to stop the water for a second and you let the pressure build, then you let go and water rushes out, but then you use you thumb to clamp down just a bit on the water to spray it. This is kinda like the speech production of voiced stop consonants in human language.(image from Kval.com)Though I’m no phoneticist, I really like VOT as a target of linguistic study for one crucial reason: it’s a clear example of a linguistic feature that varies according to your human language system but which you do NOT have conscious control over. What that means is that you cannot consciously change the length of your own personal VOT. Go ahead, try it. Make your VOT 20 milliseconds longer. Go ahead, I’ll wait…Of course you can’t. Well, not consciously, but what researchers have found is that your brain, quite independent of conscious will or knowledge, can! Lab studies have found that people will unknowingly alter their VOTs according to certain situations, and the results are predictable. For example, they found that when listening to a set of long VOT stimuli, subjects will begin to lengthen their own VOTS, in essence accommodating the longer VOTs. Over the longer term it has also been shown that people will lengthen their VOT over their lifetime to accommodate cultural shifts. It has been shown that The Queen Mother herself now has a longer VOT than during her younger days (few other people have been recorded consistently over a long period to provide such valuable data, so thanks mum).Here’s what Bane et al. did: They took recordings of confessional sequences from the UK reality TV show Big Brother (where groups of strangers are made to live with each other and occasionally speak to a camera alone like a video diary) and tested what happened to 4 crucial individuals (the ones that stayed on the show long enough to provide several months worth of data points). What they found was that their VOTs did in fact change, though no linear pattern was discovered (i.e., they did not simply get longer in a steady line).  This paper is labeled as a progress report because they don&amp;#39;t have a firm hypothesis about what actually is happening. Nice trick there boys, ;)They did find one interesting thing: During part of the show, the house mates were physically divided into basically a caste system where half the people were low caste and half were high (a heaven and a hell. And this seemed to have an effect on VOT as well (sociolinguists are slap happy about this, I&amp;#39;m sure).I haven’t looked at the actual number very closely, but in section 6, they say “Housemate trajectories seem to diverge when the divide is present…” However, just taking a glance at the Figure 3, it looks like the diverge at the beginning, then converge at the end, episode 65 (and remain somewhat similar until several episodes of non-DIVIDE have gone by). If my cursory glance is correct, I would assume it takes awhile for the convergence to manifest, and then it persists for awhile after DIVIDE is gone. But this is just me looking at the picture, not the actual data.Finally, and this is just a readability point, but I would order the names in Figure 3 in the same order as the end point of each trajectory, making it easier to follow who is doing what.Max Ban, Peter Graf, &amp;amp; Morgan Sonderegge (2011).

&lt;p&gt;Ugh.  Don’t do that.  Please don’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it.  Really, I do.  The Bible is fiction.  Very true.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you take it upon yourself to “fix” the location of the books in the library, you’re only making the librarians do more work.  And you’re making it tougher for people who actually need those books to find them.  You haven’t made a good point — or even a point at all.  You’re a jerk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might as well litter in the aisles while you’re at it.  It serves the same purpose — someone else has to clean up the mess you left behind.&lt;br&gt;

When presented with evidence to the contrary, they ignore or downplay it. According to Matthew Feinberg and Robb Willer, this is exactly what happens when such people are presented with dire warnings about global warning.

Feinberg and Willer had 97 undergrads read one of two versions of a newspaper-style article about global warming and its likely consequences. Both articles began in the same way with findings reported by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but then one of them went on to describe apocalyptic consequences whereas the other was more upbeat and described potential technological solutions.

The effect of the articles on the participants&amp;#39; global warming scepticism depended partly on their strength of just-world beliefs, as measured at the study start (by their agreement or not with statements like &amp;#39;I believe that, by and large, people get what they deserve&amp;#39;). Those participants with stronger just-world beliefs were actually made more sceptical about global warming by the more shocking newspaper article. By contrast, the more upbeat article reduced participants&amp;#39; scepticism regardless of the strength of their just-world beliefs. 

A second study provoked just-world beliefs in some participants by having them de-scramble sentences that spelt out phrases such as &amp;#39;somehow justice will always prevail&amp;#39;. Control participants also de-scrambled sentences but they weren&amp;#39;t related to just-world beliefs. Next, all the participants watched a 60-second dire message video clip about climate change. It featured a train hurtling towards a child and children making tick-tock clock noises - the message being that future generations of children will suffer from global warming&amp;#39;s consequences. After watching the video, the participants primed with just-world phrases reported more scepticism about global warming compared with the controls, and less willingness to change their own behaviour.

This is the latest in a string of studies that suggest fear-based messages can backfire if they clash with people&amp;#39;s underlying beliefs. For example, morbid anti-smoking messages can actually encourage smoking in those for whom the habit is tied to their self-esteem. In relation to climate change, there&amp;#39;s evidence that framing environmentalism as patriotic can be more effective than playing on people&amp;#39;s fears.

&amp;#39;We believe that our findings should be informative for politicians and environmental advocates who are interested in understanding public reaction to climate-change research and advocacy efforts,&amp;#39; the researchers said. &amp;#39;More generally, our research responds to recent calls for psychologists to become actively involved in the study of climate-change attitudes and behaviour and complements the small but growing body of insights psychology has contributed to this topic.&amp;#39;

The farther we move back in time (and the farther we move away from science) we see more and bigger claims of divine intervention.  Gods have been responsible for thunder, lightning, rain, comets, and holding up the very earth itself. The Christian god in particular has been finding himself with less and less to do these days...It’s almost enough to make a person think gods — and the Christian god, too — have simply been the human explanation for that which was not understood. &lt;a href="http://hambydammit.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/the-diminishing-of-the-gods/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3937307103411899177?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I’ve been debating them for years now and I don’t think there has been a single occasion where they didn’t either  accuse me of being paid off by the pharmaceutical companies without any justification or accused other critics of theirs of being paid by pharma. And I’m not being hyperbolic here. This accusation has been made on every single occasion. That alone should speak volumes about the intellectual honesty of their movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/01/lauer-cooper-and-stephanopoulos-adopt-skeptic-communityscience-medias-failing-tactics.html"&gt;Now another drone from Age of Autism, Ginger Taylor, has written a piece&lt;/a&gt; where she explains how incredibly reasonable she and her cohorts have been to their critics…despite their critics being corrupt monsters who willing sacrifice the safety of children for their own profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s her version anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I published an extensive piece detailing the problems I saw in the  Skeptic movement (which I really now see as just the Contrarian  movement, as they don’t seem to be skeptical of some assertions that  someone from Missouri would demand proof of, but merely oppose anything  our community says no matter how reasonable) and in “science writers”  who act as mere functionaries of Pharma and their friends/sometime  employees in public health. It was entitled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/09/chris-mooney-sheril-kirshenbaum-lori.html"&gt;Chris  Mooney, Sheril Kirshenbaum, Lori Kozlowski, Rosie Mestel, Thomas Maugh,  David Gorski, Virginia Hughes, Science Journalists, The Dying of the LA  Times and an Angry Autism Mom&lt;/a&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It details my earnest  attempts to get through to these skeptics/science journalists, and an  effort to point out that they are shooting themselves in the foot with  their actions, and that our children are collateral damage in their  efforts.  Long story short… they are some pretty myopic people and not  open to self-evaluation, so their tactics continue to loose them the  vaccine/autism wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See,  she made earnest attempts to get through to these maniacs who have the repugnance to disagree with her, despite their evil and willful corruption. Of course she, like her cohorts and her predecessor Senator McCarthy, failed to present evidence of foul play by her critics at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critics she mentions share the same position as every reputable health organization on Earth and their criticisms are quite substantive. But since Ms. Taylor doesn’t actually understand enough of the science to challenge their scientific criticisms, it’s much easier to just write off every criticism as mere contrarianism…a claim that she also doesn’t seem interested in backing up with evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She does give one example of alleged conflict of interest though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*After I posted the piece, Dr. David “Orac” Gorski sent me a flattering  email saying he had actually always respected me and asked me to remove  the piece. When I declined, he let the insults fly again. So… not the  most honest and straightforward guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, we learned that Gorski has spent the last several years&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/06/david-gorskis-financial-pharma-ties-what-he-didnt-tell-you.html"&gt; developing a drug for vaccine maker &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2012404820110120?pageNumber=1"&gt;Sanofi&lt;/a&gt;,  which he had some how forgotten to mention in his hundreds of posts  about these issues, so I do feel a bit the sucker for approaching him as  if he was actually a somewhat disinterested party in this debate. Had I  known I would not have wasted so many hours trying to have a real  discussion with him, but live and learn I guess.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we’re just going to have to take her word about that first incident as she doesn’t seem to link to any evidence that it took place. I don’t know what happened and I certainly don’t see how that in any way refutes the conclusions currently held by every reputable health organization on Earth. And then just just repeats the “hungry lie” (to steal Handley’s stupid phrase) of Jake Crosby, citing his piece in the same blog she writes for. This is like if one of my fellow Gotham Skeptics wrote a piece accusing Ginger Taylor of being a drug dealer, a claim made by no other person, and then I wrote a piece in the Gotham Skeptic where I repeated the claim and cited by fellow Gotham Skeptic blogger’s unsubstantiated rumor as my source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5627"&gt;Gorski has already told his side of the story and called young Jake out on his libelous bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. But his refutation of the accusation wasn’t convenient to Honest Ginger Taylor here so she didn’t find it necessary to even mention it. Cause she’s such a fair and honest journalist. Yeah, that’s the ticket! Crosby and the rest of the anti-vaccine movement deliberate choose to not distinguish tenuous relationships with industry from real conflicts of interest. They also choose not to pay attention to regulatory compliance policies and how those policies discourage unhealthy relationships by making making it very costly to all parties involved while providing huge incentives to whistle blowers, &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/12/21/oh-brother-jake-crosby-is-the-walking-embodiment-of-poes-law/"&gt;as I discussed&lt;/a&gt; when addressing Jake Crosby’s hilarious accusation that John Stossel had a conflict of interest because he wasn’t an only child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to Ginger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…so I do feel a bit the sucker for approaching him as if he was actually a somewhat disinterested party in this debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, anyone who thinks Ginger Taylor genuinely approached David Gorski or any critic of her warped ideology without actively searching for ammunition to launch a character attack as a cheap attempt to justify dismissing their position out of hand would be the sucker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gorski began his rebuttal to Jake Crosby’s libelous blog entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the very favorite and most commonly used tactics to attack  criticism in the armamentarium of pseudoscientists, cranks, and quacks  (not to mention politicians) is the &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/ad-hominem.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt; fallacy&lt;/a&gt;.  In this fallacy, rather than addressing the actual evidence and science  that demonstrate their favorite brand of woo to be nothing more than  fairy dust, the idea is to preemptively attack and discredit the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, Ginger Taylor has said not one thing in her entire polemic to even address the actual evidence and science. She doesn’t understand it and she’s praying you don’t ask her about it. Instead, she’d rather fling feces at her critics, crying that they’re all out to get her while pretending she’s fair, impartial, and genuinely open to engaging in civil discourse with her critics. Bullshit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says it all right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you will take the time to read it, especially if you are someone  who believes the media on this issue and  super especially if you are  Matt Lauer, Anderson Coooper, George Stephanopolous or any other major  news personality who has been handed a press release labeled “News” that  was likely drafted in a Pharma conference room and told to get really  angry at some guy named Andrew Wakefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. They’re ALL out to get her. Everyone in the position to disagree with her is in on the big conspiracy. I have not had one interaction with any members of the anti-vaccine movement that didn’t involve them accusing critics of being big pharma shills. Not one. And clearly Ginger Taylor has not broken that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t enough money in the entire world to pay off all the people Ginger believes are being paid off by Big Pharma to make people think vaccines are safe, let alone enough money for pharmaceutical companies to pay all those people off AND still actually produce the vaccines. Who made up this plan, Dr. Evil? This would have to be the most incompetent evil plot ever. How would pharmaceutical companies even hope to profit off the vaccines if they’re throwing so much money away just to convince people get the vaccines? And even if they could manage to at the end of the day make some profit, wouldn’t there have to be a much easier way to make a profit? Like couldn’t they must sell products that work and are safe that don’t require spending quadrillions of dollars sweeping public relations disasters under the rug?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, ESP being in the realm of the paranormal, it ought to be somewhat outside the purview of Big Science.But who cares about ESP?! What comes under scrutiny is statistics, the mathematical theory underlying hypothesis testing. And inference. The brief story is worth a read, as it cites statisticians on what these statistical tests actually tell us, as well as the ups and downs of Bayesian stats.An important thing to keep in mind is that no matter how mathematical, statistics is nevertheless like everything else in science - a human endeavor. No matter how creative and insightful humans can be, there&amp;#39;s always a limit to our ability to decipher the world around us. I&amp;#39;m certainly not decrying statistics, but it&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind that these aren&amp;#39;t just handed down to us from on high. We human beings play a critical (and often subjective) hand in how we apply statistics to address our research questions.Along these lines, just last night I was reading about body mass variation in the Gombe chimpanzees (Pusey et al. 2005), and the authors provide a very insightful quote from statistician George Box:All models are wrong; some models are useful.As I added to this on Facebook, &amp;quot;... some models can be hott.&amp;quot;ReferencesMiller G (2011).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Tomorrow is Yom Ha&amp;#39;Shoah, the day of &lt;a href="http://history1900s.about.com/cs/holocaust/a/yomhashoah.htm"&gt;remembering the Holocaust.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Southern California has a &lt;a href="http://college.usc.edu/vhi/"&gt;Shoah Foundation Institute&lt;/a&gt;.  You could honor the day by making a donation, or by exploring the resources there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will honor the day by re-reading the &lt;a href="http://www.annefrank.com/"&gt;The Diary of Anne Frank,&lt;/a&gt;  Why &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?   It was by reading the book that I learned that the Jews were annihilated in Europe.    I know I was younger than she was when she wrote the book, so it was before 1964.  It may have been assigned to my older sister, or one of my older cousins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/images/GypsyNazi600.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="GypsyNazi600" border="0" height="293" src="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/images/GypsyNazi600-thumb.jpg" width="399"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Roma woman with Nazi soldiers*; &lt;a href="http://www.okay.com/dunc/wartime.htm"&gt;image source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family, my ancestors, being American citizens for three to five generations before 1941,  being not Jewish (that I know), being renegade Mormons in some branches, being otherwise Christian,  didn&amp;#39;t know anyone who died in the camps, let alone losing loved ones.    My male relatives -- my father and uncles -- all served in the Navy or if in the European theater, were far from the camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also honor the day by thinking of those who opposed the Germans.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honor the day by reciting &lt;a href="http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t053/t05389.html"&gt;Pastor Niemoller&amp;#39;s confession:&lt;/a&gt;  (Wikipedia &lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Niem%C3%B6ller"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als die Nazis die Kommunisten holten,&lt;br&gt; habe ich geschwiegen;&lt;br&gt; ich war ja kein Kommunist.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Als sie die Sozialdemokraten einsperrten,&lt;br&gt; habe ich geschwiegen;&lt;br&gt; ich war ja kein Sozialdemokrat.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Als sie die Gewerkschafter holten,&lt;br&gt; habe ich nicht protestiert;&lt;br&gt; ich war ja kein Gewerkschafter.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Als sie die Juden holten,&lt;br&gt; habe ich nicht protestiert;&lt;br&gt; ich war ja kein Jude.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Als sie mich holten,&lt;br&gt; gab es keinen mehr, der protestierte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000066"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translation&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;br&gt;First the Nazis came…&lt;br&gt; First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt; because I was not a communist;&lt;br&gt; Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt; because I was not a socialist;&lt;br&gt; Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt; because I was not a trade unionist;&lt;br&gt; Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt; because I was not a Jew;&lt;br&gt; Then they came for me—&lt;br&gt; and there was no one left to speak out for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the night of encounter, the navigation camera will be used to acquire 72 high-resolution images of the comet's surface features. Stardust-NExT mission scientists will use these images to see how surface features on comet Tempel 1 have changed over the past five-and-a-half years. (Tempel 1 had previously been visited and imaged in July of 2005 by NASA's Deep Impact mission).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classical account holds that conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus.  However, we have been arguing for some time that conduction aphasia is caused by damage to area Spt -- a functionally defined region in the vicinity of the left planum temporale that exhibits auditory-motor response properties, and which we claim computes a mapping between auditory and motor speech representations, critical for aspects of speech production.  Our hypothesized link between conduction aphasia and area Spt just got stronger.  In a forthcoming paper in Brain and Language Buchsbaum et al. show that the region of maximal overlap in lesion distribution of a group of 14 conduction aphasics includes area Spt (based on fMRI data from over 100 participants). We argue that the auditory-motor transformation function carried out by Spt is necessary for verbatim repetition but also plays a critical role in internal monitoring during speech production, thus explaining the increased speech error rate when the system is damaged.  This explanation does a better job of explaining the co-occurrence of phonemic paraphasias and repetition deficits than does the current dominant model of the deficit in conduction aphasia, namely, that it is a working memory deficit.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I’ve had an amazing number of letters from people, I still get them.  Hand written ones to my house, as well as emails to my office in New York.  Saying really, the nicest things, most of them… not all.  And trying to assure me that, in their minds, my life hasn’t been a waste of time, even if it ends prematurely.  I’m 62 in April, if I make it that far.  And believe me, that’s been encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned something from it, which is of course, like most of the things one knows that are important, already known to me, but I really know it now.  &lt;strong&gt;Never put off writing a letter to one who is in distress.  It is always very much appreciated.  I’m not asking for more people to write to me, but if they have someone in mind, or someone known to them, and they haven’t quite gotten around to it yet… I’d urge them to do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a terrific help to me, I must say.  And I’m not a particularly vulnerable person in that way, not that easily stirred.  But this has been very moving for me, very confirming.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to honor Hitchens for everything he’s done, Scott is encouraging people to submit their own letters to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is called &lt;a href="http://dearchristopher.com/"&gt;Dear Christopher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few excerpts from letters are below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I had no idea who you were. I didn’t know what you looked like, what you sounded like. But your writing, brilliant as your writing tends to be, spoke to me.  It made statements I couldn’t deny and revealed other facts that made me more comfortable in being an atheist.  You hear stories of people who are afraid to mention their atheism, but I feel that after reading your book, I never had any such qualms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465030335?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465030335"&gt;Letters to a Young Contrarian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I felt as if I was being addressed directly. The book came at a pivotal moment, inspiring me to dedicate my life to the annihilation of the “mind-forg’d manacles” and the institutions of their construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitchens showed me that theocracy was the great human evil; that men with a weapon in one hand and a Holy book in the other encompass much of what is debased in thought and action. And he managed it with charm and wit I had never expected to find in theological debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your writings, lectures, your leadership, and personal actions have proven to me that the human mind, through the tools of thought and logic, can allow us to break free of our animalistic behaviors, fears and superstitions. Through your teachings, I now have the knowledge that humanity can be more than what it has been and that we need nothing divine to explain art, music or love.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 Automobile accidents are the ninth leading cause of death worlwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than a million people are killed on roads annually, and that number could rise to 2.5 million by 2020. WHO estimates that traffic accidents cost developing countries an astonishing 1-2 % of their gross domestic product (GDP).

For years now, police and public health officials have puzzled over the alarming number of traffic accidents in East Africa. In terms of sheer numbers, Asian countries have the highest total traffic fatalities, according to figures compiled by  the Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP), a consortium including the World Bank, the Red Cross and other aid agencies (PDF HERE).  That is not surprising, since these nations contain the majority of the world’s drivers.

However, beyond the picture of traffic fatalities in terms of sheer numbers, or on a per population basis, there is another revealing measure—traffic deaths per motor vehicle. And when the GRSP measured nations by that yardstick, the four worst countries in the world for traffic deaths—judging by the number of fatalities per 10,000 licensed vehicles—were Ethiopia, Tanzania, Lesotho, and Kenya—all East African nations. 

Moreover, these are all African countries in which the use of khat--an amphetamine-like plant drug that is the natural precursor of the designer drug known as mephedrone--is legal and common. The major khat-using countries in Africa are commonly listed as: Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, Ethiopa, Tanzania, Lesotho. Note the overlap. Khat, as one online article put it, is “the legal high of east Africa.” 

On the tiny island nation of Mauritius, just off the southeast African coast, Touria Prayag writes at allAfrica.com that drivers “zoom past you, zigzag on the roads, nervously changing to the left lane to swiftly veer back on your side without any warning…. brazenly flouting the Highway Code in every imaginable dangerous manner…. And the carnage continues….”

In Ethiopia, annual road crash fatalities account for 114 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, compared to one death per 10,000 vehicles in Great Britain, and an average of 60 deaths per 10,000 vehicles across 39 sub-Saharan African countries. A report in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization (PDF HERE)  notes that Ethiopian truck drivers “are regarded as so dangerous that their trucks are commonly referred to across Ethiopia as ‘al Qaeda.’” Anecdotally, Ethiopians told WHO officials that khat “increased driver confidence and vehicle speed while also making drivers irritable and impairing concentration,” and that high levels of khat could lead to hallucinations.

A Kenya forum on TripAdvisor asks: Are matatus [local taxes piloted by khat-chewing Kenyans] safe?” 

Since khat is legally available in most of East Africa, and comprises a significant part of the social fabric of local cultures, the use of khat is similar to the use of alcohol in higher-income nations. But does khat present the same threat of driving impairment as alcohol? Bolivia is now arguing its right to allow citizens to chew coca leaves in the traditional manner. Is it safe to drive and chew coca leaves? In all of these cases, the challenge is to determine what constitutes a “safe” dose of the drug; a dose that does not endanger people on or near the highway. There is not enough research on khat to answer that question. Nor is there a way to administer roadside tests for khat. The best evidence, African police officers say, is green teeth.

The active ingredients in khat—cathine and cathinone—are similar in structure to amphetamines, and chemically similar to the ingredients used in the manufacture of mephedrone powder. Mephedrone is sold as 4-MMC, Meow Meow, M-Cat, and other nicknames. Cathine and cathinone ramp up dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline levels in a manner very similar to amphetamine, with many of the same positive effects (mild euphoria, reduced hunger, increased energy) and the same negative effects (depression, fatigue, lack of appetite, drug craving). It is thought that chronic use of khat results in dopamine D2 depletion in areas of the brain involved in goal-directed action.

The current fervor over mephedrone being disguised as bath salts or plant food for black market sales purposes in the U.S and U.K. demonstrates that this question is not academic for developed western nations. Sold as Ivory Wave, or Bliss, or White Lightning, mephedrone and other products containing cathinone are increasingly available across the U.S. states. In 2008, police seized 600 pounds of fresh khat—in Fargo, North Dakota. 

A recent paper published in Frontiers in Psychology, authored by a group of Dutch and Spanish psychologists, appears to show that khat users exhibit a specific cognitive deficit: On stop-signal tasks, stop signal reaction time  (SSRT) was significantly slower for the khat users. Such tests typically involve rapidly pressing a green “go” button upon seeing an arrow in certain positions, or abruptly aborting the response when the arrow turns red. The test measures “individual ability to stop a planned or ongoing motor response in a voluntary fashion.” For example, someone with Parkinson’s disease would score at the very high end of the SSRT scale.

The study itself involved 20 regular khat users recruited from the immigrant populations of Leiden and The Hague, and matched against 20 khat-free controls. All of the khat users met four or more of the 7 DSM-IV criteria for addiction, and did not consume alcohol the night before the test. The investigators speculate that this reduced level of inhibitory control “may even be involved in the emergence of addiction: the more a drug is used, the less able users are to prevent themselves from using it.”

The parallels to traffic signals and stop signs are obvious, and apt. The authors state that the findings of their study are “rather worrying because, first, many real-life situations require active inhibition of prepotent actions, as in the case of traffic lights turning red, or of criminal actions.” The obvious conclusion is that the chronic chewing of khat leaves “may indeed lead to a marked deterioration of cognitive functions (as inhibitory control) implicated in driving behavior.” Studies by NIDA director Nora Volkow and others have show that cocaine users suffer similar reductions in dopamine D2 receptors and “need significantly more time to inhibit responses to stop signals than non-users.” In general, stimulant drugs taken regularly at high doses appear to disrupt response inhibition due to alterations in dopamine functioning. (Although some studies have shown a facilitation of inhibitory control at lower doses). 

The usual caveats apply: It is impossible to rule out pre-existing propensities for impulsivity, disinhibition, and the like. Some health researchers do not agree that the case for driving impairment on khat has yet been made. In the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, Anita Feigin of the Centre for Population Health in Australia writes that, so far, much of the information is anecdotal, “and, as yet, there is no clear evidence of a causal relationship between the use of khat and traffic accidents.” African taxi drivers who immigrate to Australia use khat “to stay awake and alert.” However, Feigin notes that the use of khat has deeply divided the members of east African migrant communities.

It is an interesting conundrum. The developed West has its entrenched tradition of alcohol as a legal high, despite its side-effects, which frequently result in mayhem on the highways.  On the other hand, the drinking nations must now contend with demands from other cultures for the decriminalization of khat and coca leaf,  which, along with coffee and tea, make up a category we might call the “soft” stimulants.

Because of the connection with mephedrone and other amphetamine-like designer drugs, these questions will not be going away until more research provides some solid answers. Such research may not be long in coming: The NIH-funded Khat Research Program (KRP) at the University of Minnesota, for example,  brings American researchers together with a br...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The authors revisit a genetic locus where there have been earlier suggestions of hominin admixture dating back 15 years. In particular, they focus on an intronic segment spanning exon 44 of the dystrophin gene, termed dys44. Of the haplotypes in this they suggested one, B006, introgressed from a different genetic background than that of neo-Africans. The  map of B006 shows the distribution of the putative “archaic” haplotype from a previous paper cited in the current one from 2003. As you can see there’s a pattern of non-African preponderance of this haplotype. So what’s dystrophin‘s deal? From Wikipedia:

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes in, we talk about a mashup of Obama smiling in White House photos that’s been floating around (see below). When I pointed it out to &lt;a href="http://lapsco.univ-bpclermont.fr/persos/niedenthal/"&gt;Paula Niedenthal&lt;/a&gt;, my main source for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/science/25smile.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;my Times article&lt;/a&gt;, she likened his smile to the way we say hello on the phone. It always sounds the same, but that sameness doesn’t say much of anything about our emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;

It sounds a little odd — the day after the state of the union address, they bring on a creationist kook? — and they don&amp;#39;t say exactly what the topic is, although we can probably guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ham is asking for prayers. They won't help him much against Lynn, who is simply an awesome speaker. It could be fine entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, prayers wouldn't help him much if his opponent was Big Bird, either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Lynn was excellent, but then he always is. The best moment for me was after Lynn stated that what Ham was doing was getting subsidies for a ministry, Cooper turned to Ham and simply asked, "Are you trying to convert people?" Of course he is, but Ham can't be honest about his intent, so he gulped and went into his spiel about how the Ark Encounter is run by a shell company as a for-profit endeavor. He didn't answer the question at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And isn't this game of separating the profit-making part of the park into a separate company rather devious? The profits will just go to Answers in Genesis, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about the House Republicans’ desire to read the Constitution aloud… but only after omitting that whole &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/06/AR2011010603759.html"&gt;Three-Fifths Compromise&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;em&gt;How dare people change the Constitution by getting rid of the parts that don’t sit well with the public?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when she realized &lt;a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/huckfinn-constitution-bible"&gt;she had been doing the same thing with the Bible&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was putting together the liturgy for The Mission and decided I wanted to include Psalm 9 in our reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verses 4-6 didn’t sound very Christlike to me, so I whipped out that most venerated weapon in the Bible-reader’s arsenal — the ellipses — and with the precision of an expert, surgically removed them. Our liturgy was tidy and consistent and comfortable again. No one would even notice those three little dots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It took about 17 seconds for the irony of the situation to settle in.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It raises a lot of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it ok for Christians to effectively ignore books like Leviticus in their Bible studies?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don’t pastors ever seem to talk about the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/08/27/illustrated-stories-from-the-bible/"&gt;rape and murder&lt;/a&gt; in the Old Testament? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it ok for Christians to clip out Bible verses they don’t think represent their faith well when preparing a reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like they “sanitize” the Bible for children and then give them the real, full version as adults — the adults ignore the embarrassing parts, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to be a Christian, you can’t pretend like those verses aren’t there.&lt;br&gt;

He addresses the "problem" of what should replace religion once we get rid of it. You may wonder what "problem" he's referring to. After all, when you visit countries in Europe you don't see a pressing need to come up with some institutions that replace religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a list of good things that religion provides according to Dennett: hope, love, beauty, joy, and moral teamwork. These are the things we get from organized religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really? I haven't noticed that these things are missing in the lives of my atheist friends. Nor have I noticed that the people of Denmark or Belgium are loveless, joyless and incapable of moral teamwork. What the heck is he talking about? What he's talking about is the idea that a church is "the place where if you have to go there they have to take you in." &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;... churches do that very well. They are a safety net of last resort for many people, and not just poor people, ... churches open their doors to these people and they can do a better job at this than government agencies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He's talking about churches as safety nets and sources of social support. What he's talking about is the (possible) necessity of churches in a country that rejects socialism. He's talking about America but he doesn't admit it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can watch the faces of this mostly Canadian audience, as I did, to see how well Dennet's ideas are being received. There's a lot of puzzled looks as you might expect in a country where socialized medicine is a universal right. Why do you need churches for those things that any just society must provide? Why do you need churches when you have publicly funded community centers where you can hang out with your friends and neighbors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things go rapidly downhill from that point on (about 12 minutes into the talk). The next part of the talk is about religious music. It includes some truly excruciating atheist gospel songs that the audience is subjected to. (They cut out a large part of that from the video.) The remainder of the talk has very little to do with the necessity of religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m5tGpMcFF7U" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-8879832800980327359?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296070073699"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/i_get_email_75.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ea92e63591eaca3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">I get email</title><published>2011-01-26T19:03:42Z</published><updated>2011-01-26T19:03:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XYMMcRAdjig/i_get_email_75.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/i_get_email_75.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of February, I've mentioned that a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/oh_look_what_will_be_happening.php"&gt;flack from Answers in Genesis will be appearing in Morris&lt;/a&gt;.  I guess the local hosts of that event are a little worried that I might breathe fire over their little church, so they just sent me a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Myers,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am the local coordinator for the Answers in Genesis conference which will be held in Morris on Feb. 27 and 28 featuring Dr. Terry Mortenson.  I realize that there is a lot of real estate between our opinions on this subject.  My hope is that we create a respectful discussion about this issue which will be challenging.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I would like to meet with you, at your convenience, to discuss the conference, the schedule, and how we can make it a positive experience for all members of our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How odd and annoying. I've attended creationist events in town before, and they should know by now that I don't cause grief, at least not &lt;i&gt;during&lt;/i&gt; the talks. So I wrote this back to him. I always believe in being honest and straightforward with people, even creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. Well. I can guarantee you that I and the people I will be bringing along to the event will be quiet, polite, and entirely non-disruptive; we'll do nothing but observe, take note, and possibly ask a few simple questions, and we'll follow any restrictions you want to place on us. You can ask your friends at Answers in Genesis; I led a group of 300 students through the Creation Museum, and we did not run riot or create any real problems for the staff or other attendees. We'll do the same here, although we definitely won't have such a large contingent this time around.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I have to be honest with you: there will be no respect for this nonsense, and I do not consider bringing in dishonest incompetents to miseducate and misrepresent science to be a positive experience for our community. We will respect your right to have discussions of this sort and will in no way impede your ability to present creationist dogma to your audience, but I will not agree in any way with any of it, and once I step away from your church grounds you can expect that my criticisms will be thorough and fiery and will not include any pretense of respect for Answers in Genesis or the Morris Evangelical Free Church.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I don't quite see the point of meeting. You know my position, and I know yours and Terry Mortenson's. It is your event and I do not expect any accommodation for actual, honest science in it, nor do I demand it. Since I have promised that I will create no obstacles to your agenda, there really isn't any good reason to discuss anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they weren't misled by my prior instances of polite behavior into somehow thinking I'm &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt;, or something.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course not. Science speaks only to the improbable, not the impossible. If philosophy rules the day, God can never be ruled out entirely, because one could argue that human cognitive evolution was directly and intentionally inspired by God, so we alone, of all species, can perceive Him (and reality in general) using our naturally evolved theory of mind.  But if scientific parsimony prevails, and I think it should, such philosophical positioning becomes embarrassingly like grasping at straws.

Daron Acemoglu explains why we care about income inequality: "First, people's well-being may directly depend on inequality, for example, because they view a highly unequal society as unfair or because the utility loss due to low status of the have-nots may be greater than the utility gain due to the higher status of the haves. Second and more importantly, equality of opportunity may be harder to achieve in an unequal society ... Third and most importantly, inequality impacts politics.

This galaxy is at a mind-crushing distance of &lt;strong&gt;13.2 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; light years from Earth&lt;/strong&gt;, making it not just the most distant galaxy but also the most distant extant object ever detected!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the object in question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2011/01/hudf_z10.3galaxy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2011/01/hudf_z10.3galaxy.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="610"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small box shows the location of the galaxy, which is invisible by eye in the image. The zoomed region shows it in the infrared, where it glows more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[NOTE: Let me be clear up front and say that this is a&lt;/em&gt; candidate &lt;em&gt;galaxy, since it hasn't been confirmed using other distance determination methods. However, having read the paper I think the astronomers did an excellent job showing this is very likely to be a galaxy 13.2 giga-light years away. From here on out I'll refer to it as if it's real, but to be fair bear in mind there is some small chance it may turn out not to be real.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in Uganda that I encountered one of Africa’s most dangerous predators. I was counting chimpanzees in the Ugandan jungle, when I felt a sharp pain on my forearm. I pushed up my shirtsleeve. Attached to my skin was a giant ant the size of my toenail. Its head was so big I could see the serrations on it pincers that had dug halfway into my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flicked it with my other hand. It didn’t move. I brushed it, harder. It just wiggled all six legs and bit more deeply. I started to panic. I grabbed the ant between two fingers and pulled as hard as I could. Its body came off in my hands and its head was still firmly embedded in my arm, blood pooling around its knifelike jaws.  As if on cue, a thousand kindred mandibles sunk themselves into my flesh. I looked down. I was covered in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I learnt one of Africa’s most valuable lessons: ignore ants at your peril.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520261992?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0520261992"&gt;Mark Moffet’s book&lt;/a&gt; had been around at the time, because then I would have understood how impressive, wondrous, and magnificent ants truly are. They weigh * of the world’s biomass…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who have never thought much about ants besides brushing them from your socks, Moffets tells some astounding tales. The Amazon ants abduct * ants at birth, storming * nests to abduct the pupae. Named after the female warriors who were rumoured to steal children and bring them up as their own, the Amazon ants take their captured quarry back to their own nest, * slaves take over, raising the larvae as slaves. Amazon ants are surprisingly helpless, they depend on their slaves to find food * and *. Without their slaves, they would perish. All their energy goes into battling * colonies and abducting the next generation of slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An image that stays with me is of Moffet describing how on the last part of the raid, the slaves run out to meet the returning Amazons and hoist them on their shoulders for the rest of the journey home, while the Amazons lounge on the shoulders of their carriers like conquering heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520261992?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0520261992"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/2011/01/Food_O_082_Moffett065-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the most striking features of the book is the photographs. Moffet travelled all over the world to bring, what Owen Wilson rightly claims are some of the best photographs of ants in the world. The photographs bring the ants to life with skill that have proudly graced the pages of National Geographic. They pull you in, holding your attention with the loving detail that you miss when these creatures crawl off into the distance with parts of your sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazing Adventures of Ants is more than a natural history book, although it is an excellent one at that. It is the journey of a remarkable man with the mind of a scientist and the excitement of a boy doing what we all dream of – running to the most exotic places in the world chasing the unbelievable. The tales spread throughout the book will make you want to follow him, and give you a new appreciation for the world’s most overlooked inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecklund continues her campaign with a turgid essay, the headline post at today’s &lt;em&gt;Huffpo Religion&lt;/em&gt; (where else?), “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elaine-howard-ecklund-phd/when-university-scientist_b_811658.html"&gt;Why university scientists do not discuss religion.&lt;/a&gt;“  You’d think this reticence would be a good thing, but Ecklund deplores it, for it prevents the loving union between science and faith that she so desires (and was funded to promote):&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But religion appears to be advancing on university campuses. There  has been a rise in the number of religious studies departments,  societies for the scholarly study of religion (in a variety of  disciplines), and institutes devoted to dialogue between religion and  science. Yet, perhaps because of how busy their research keeps them (the  working hours per week for research university professors has steadily  increased over the past 40 years) or their inherent lack of interest in  religion, many elite scientists do not know about such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since those scientists who are religious often keep their faith  closeted, their nonreligious colleagues have little reason to think  there is any place for religion in the academy, or any way for science  and religion to be reconciled. This is too bad because many scientists  who fear the encroaching impact of religion generally fear the most  fundamentalist forms of it. And since their fellow scientists with  religious views are reluctant to talk openly about their own beliefs,  such stereotypes are rarely dispelled. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we fail to engage with religion?  An &lt;em&gt;explosion&lt;/em&gt; might happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the scientists at elite universities fail to successfully engage with  religion on their campuses, other American universities might follow  suit. And if the current resurgence of religion on college campuses  collides with persistently antireligious models of university life,  might a collision or an explosion of some sort be inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note the dreadful writing that characterizes this essay: if there is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a collision, then a collision might be inevitable!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research shows that religious scientists often already feel embattled  in their academic communities. They struggle with how public they  should be about their faith commitments, given that so many of their  colleagues are negative toward religion (evangelicalism and  fundamentalism, in particular). Yet because religious scientists rarely  talk candidly about their faith while in the university environment,  they have not yet realized that a significant proportion of their  colleagues, although not religious themselves, are open to talking and  thinking about religion and matters of faith. In this way, both groups  end up closeting faith and perpetuating the assumption that there is no  safe place for intelligent discussions about religion on America’s elite  university campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templeton sure got its money’s worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry, Dr. Ecklund—I’m doing my bit!  I’m at an “elite” university, and I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; speaking up more about religion—though perhaps not exactly in the way you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reported this morning that the star was seen knocking back sake at Katsuya, a Japanese restaurant in Hollywood, celebrating her first real meal in days after a detoxing cleanse. (Exactly which cleanse she was on, they don’t know, but &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/eat/jessica-simpson-goes-vegan-tries-cupping-and-gets-visions/"&gt;Simpson has tweeted about her vegan detox diets&lt;/a&gt; in the past.) She apparently danced around the table, sake in hand, and wrapped up her performance by stumbling out of the restaurant on fiancé Eric Johnson’s arm. Onlookers saw her sitting in the passenger’s seat with her eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we had to say about Simpson’s detox-to-drunk act in the Blisstree office:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lilit (&lt;em&gt;editor-in-chief, &lt;a href="http://thegloss.com/"&gt;TheGloss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt; “Subtitle: why you shouldn’t get drunk immediately after finishing a cleanse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people think cleansing is too expensive, but when you consider how cheap it is to get drunk afterward, you’re actually SAVING money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lilit:&lt;/strong&gt; This is like that time I got hammered at a Yom Kippur break-the-fast party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip to all of you detoxers out there: Don’t wrap up your cleanse with a sake bomb, or any other kind of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

We are going to have a few days vacation together.  I have been working a lot of long hours and I really owe them a break from the icy tundra of our homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have a few hours to kill, I've decided to dust off a paper that I wrote when I was a graduate student that got rejected.  This paper has sat on my hard drive for years, untouched and unloved.  I have a bit of a lull in my professional life, so I figured I would go back to it and see if I can craft it in to something publishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rereading it I realize that I really hatefucked the reviewers with this paper.  It is painful to read.   I feel bad for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry, reviewers.  I didn't mean it.  I was young and naive.  If I could give you back the time my piece of shit paper stole from your life, I would.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right, 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse.  Two of the complainants in the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/omnibus-autism-proceeding"&gt;Omnibus Autism Proceeding&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf"&gt;Cedillos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/court/hazelhurst_v_hhs_docket.html"&gt;Hazelhursts&lt;/a&gt;,  relied upon the unpublished Walker et al. research.  Both the Special Masters in  the hearings, and the presiding judge in the following Hazelhurst appeal,  dismissed the evidentiary value of the Walker et al. study   (exerpts from the hearings and the appeal are below).  In other words, the Walker data have been examined and found unconvincing, because it was scientifically suspect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walker study (never published) in no way validates &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm"&gt;Wakefield&amp;#39;s fraud&lt;/a&gt;.  The MMR vaccine still does not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Daily Mail&amp;#39;s perverse habit of not date-stamping articles and scrubbing comments, plus having a date-stamp above the header, a casual reader may not realize that the article is 4 and a half years old. &lt;/p&gt;

Back in 2006, what Beck referred to as &amp;quot;new American research&amp;quot; was actually a &amp;quot;poster presentation&amp;quot; at the &lt;a href="http://www.autism-insar.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=19&amp;amp;Itemid=82"&gt;2006 International Meeting for Autism Research&lt;/a&gt; (IMFAR).  A &amp;quot;poster presentation&amp;quot; is a way of presenting preliminary results from research.In terms of levels of evidence for a particular hypothesis, it is very weak.  (The complete text of the poster presentation is below.)
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, The Mail, through Beck, overstated the case.  I suspect that Wake Forest University, and possibly the lead author, Walker, was embarrassed, and put out a press release dated   June 1, 2006 press release from  Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center &lt;a href="http://www.wfubmc.edu/News-Releases/2006/Wake_Forest_Researcher_Warns_Against_Making_Connection_Between_Presence_of_Measles_Virus_and_Autism.htm"&gt;Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Persistent Ileal Measles Virus In A Large Cohort Of Regressive Autistic Children With Ileocolitis And Lymphonodular Hyperplasia: Revisitation Of An Earlier Study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Walker, Karin Hepner, Jeffrey Segal, Arthur Krigsman, Wake Forest University School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: Autistic enterocolitis, consisting of a nonspecific ileocolitis coupled with ileocolonic lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH), was first introduced as a new, potentially virus-induced disease entity eight years ago in a group of ASD children with developmental regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to examine ileal biopsy tissue in a large cohort of pediatric patients who carry a diagnosis of regressive autism and whose chronic gastrointestinal symptoms warranted diagnostic endoscopic evaluation, for evidence of measles virus RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with autism and who were referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation of chronic GI symptoms were eligible to participate in this IRB approved study. For each patient, medical histories, vaccination records, histopathology reports, and ileocolonoscopic biopsy tissue were available for evaluation. Terminal ileum (TI) biopsy tissue was assayed by RT-PCR for the presence of measles virus RNA and PCR-positive samples were sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Medical and clinical data have been collected for &amp;gt;275 patients who fit the study inclusion criteria. PCR analysis on TI biopsy tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive for the F gene amplicon. Fourteen have been verified by DNA sequence and an additional 56 amplicons are being sequenced now. Work is ongoing to assay the remaining specimens (~200) and to identify and assay relevant control tissue samples. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this large cohort of pediatric autistic patients with chronic GI symptoms confirm earlier findings of measles virus RNA in the terminal ileum and support an association between measles virus and ileocolitis /LNH.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wake Forest Researcher Warns Against Making Connection Between Presence of Measles Virus and Autism&lt;/strong&gt; 6/1/2006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – An American scientist whose research replicates a connection published in England in 2002 between the measles virus and bowel disease in autistic children strongly warns against making the “leap” to suggesting that the measles vaccine might actually cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is not what our research is showing,” said Stephen J. Walker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of physiology and pharmacology at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. Walker and colleagues have issued an abstract to be presented at this week’s International Meeting for Autism Research, indicating that a high percentage of autistic children that they have tested with chronic bowel disease show evidence of measles virus in their intestines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some observers have said that the presence of the measles virus indicates a strong possibility that the measles vaccine, a possible source of the virus, could have caused the children’s autism. That possible connection has caused a major controversy in the United Kingdom, where the connection was first made in 2002. The vaccine is first given as part of a triple vaccine called MMR – for measles, mumps and rubella – at ages 12-18 months. That is shortly before a particular type of autism (regressive) begins to appear in children afflicted with the condition, which has fueled the speculation about a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker says the new research does not support the connection, and he notes that the results have not even been published in a peer-reviewed journal. “Even if we showed association (between measles virus and bowel disease) and we published it in a peer-reviewed journal, the conclusion will be simply that there is measles virus in the gut of a large number of children who have regressive autism and bowel disease. End of story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t done anything to demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker explains that exploring the causes of chronic bowel disease in autistic children is the major impetus for his research. “There are lots of viruses in the gut, and any one of them could be causing inflammation. If it truly is from a vaccine and this virus causes inflammation and a chronic bowel condition in some susceptible children, then that’s something that needs to be known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main task at hand, Walker said, is to determine what is causing the bowel condition in the autistic children, a condition that has a direct influence on cognitive and behavioral issues associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high percentage of autistic children have chronic bowel disease, a discovery in the late 1990s that eventually led to the measles virus connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If anybody has severe GI problems, it causes problems with focus, it causes problems with everything. You can’t do anything until you get that resolved. We’ve all experienced that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These kids experience it hour after hour every single day of their lives. Many of them are non-verbal so they can’t tell anybody what the problem is, and the behavior that they exhibit as a result of a severe stomach ache was once attributed to just being autistic and having weird behaviors – for example, leaning over the sharp edge of a coffee table for hours at a time. That seems weird, but what they’re doing is relieving pressure on their lower abdomen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker said that relieving the bowel discomfort has been shown to improve other conditions associated with autism, such as cognition and the ability to learn. “There’s case after case where kids improved cognitively, behaviorally and biomedically when you treat the bowel disease. There is a great improvement from better nutrition alone. You see improvements in their overall condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker said he will continue to look for possible causes, the biological mechanism, and new treatments of the bowel condition. “That’s the goal for me: understanding the biology of what’s causing the disease and then gaining insight into the most effective way to treat it, so that clinicians will not have to go through a trial and error approach.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr. Hepner pointed to a study that is currently in progress, conducted by herself and several others, to which I will refer as the “Walker study.”  She stated that the “preliminary data” from that study “present another step in support” of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;page 64-65&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.  The Walker study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners have also relied on a study that is currently in progress, conducted by Dr. Hepner and several others, often described as the “Walker study.”  (See Ex. 59, Tab K; P. Trial Ex. 3.) Dr. Hepner stated that the “preliminary data” from that study “present another step in support” of the proposition that the measles virus persists in the intestinal tissue of some autistic children.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; see also Tr. 634A-35A.)  After consideration of the Walker study and the testimony about it in the record of this case, however, I conclude that the study does not provide any substantial support to the proposition that the measles virus persists in the bodies of Michelle Cedillo or any other autistic individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hepner reported that she and three other researchers--Steve Walker, Jeff Segal, and Dr. Arthur Krigsman, the latter being another of petitioners’ experts in this case--are engaged in a study similar to the Uhlmann study, in that their objective is to perform PCR testing for the detection of measles virus on intestinal biopsies of children with both developmental delay and gastrointestinal symptoms.  (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 634A-35A.)  Dr. Hepner stated that the researchers generated “multiple primer sets” and “tested them for their specificity and sensitivity” in identifying the presence of measles virus.  (Tr. 635A; Ex. 63, p. 5.)  Dr. Hepner and Dr. Krigsman testified that the study, which began in 2003, is not yet complete, but that the group conducted some initial testing and presented “preliminary data” from the study at an autism-related conference in 2006, in the form of a “poster presentation” (literally, a poster board describing the study was set on an easel at the conference). (Ex. 63, p. 5; Tr. 474A-75, 634A.)  Dr. Hepner reported that of 82 biopsy samples tested in the study’s initial testing, which all came from children with both “developmental delay” and “GI [gastrointestinal] symptoms,” 70 tested positive for measles virus.  (Ex. 63, p. 5.)  She further stated, without explanation, that her group was able “to confirm vaccine strain specificity” in some of the positive samples.  (Tr. 635A.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners, in their post-hearing briefs, have relied on the Walker study as supportive of their view that the Unigenetics measles virus testing should be considered reliable.  (P1, pp. 141, 154-55, 242; P3, pp. 33-34.)  After full consideration, however, I cannot agree. First, two of respondent’s experts, Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin, each pointed to a number of flaws in the Walker study, based on the description in the poster presentation.  (Tr. 1861-65; 1952A- 59A.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a second important reason to discount the Walker study is the testimony of Dr. Hepner herself.  Dr. Hepner stated that the initial data from her study were only “very preliminary data.”  (Tr. 659.)  She acknowledged that it would be inappropriate to “draw any conclusions” from those preliminary results.  (Tr. 682.)  She acknowledged that her group at this time is still attempting “to test this assay, to optimize the assay” (Tr. 660A)--i.e., to develop the test to a point where they can then be confident that their test is yielding reliable results.  Part of developing any such test is to use “negative controls”--i.e., to test samples that are known to be free of the target, to make sure that the test is not erroneously identifying the target in samples that do not contain it.  However, Dr. Hepner explained that her group is still at the point of developing their negative controls.  (Tr. 658, 681.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Dr. Hepner was forthright in acknowledging that, in terms of drawing any conclusions with regard to the issue of the validity of measles virus testing, the preliminary data available from her study simply are “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.) In sum, it is clear that the Walker study must be disregarded.  First, both Dr. Ward and Dr. Bustin pointed out a number of reasons why one cannot draw any conclusions from, or place any reliance on, the preliminary data from the Walker study.  And even petitioners’ expert Dr. Hepner, one of the study’s own authors, has acknowledged that the preliminary data from the study are “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.)  Accordingly, I must agree with Dr. Hepner on this point.  I conclude that the Walker study is not useful in deciding the issue of whether the Unigenetics measles virus detection testing was reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p. 71&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.  The Walker study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners also, in their final post-hearing brief in this case, pointed to another item of evidence in the record.  (P4, pp. 33-34.)  They pointed to the ongoing Walker study, discussed above, and note that one of their experts who has worked on that study, Dr. Krigsman, stated that in the study’s initial testing, six specimens were determined to be positive “for vaccine-strain-specific RNA.”  (Tr. 487A.)  However, as I have already discussed above, the preliminary data from the Walker study, in the words of the petitioners’ own expert and co-author of that study, Dr. Hepner, is simply “not useful at this time.”  (Tr. 659.)  Thus, again in Dr. Hepner’s own words, it would not be appropriate for me to “draw any conclusions” from that data.  (Tr. 682.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. The Preliminary Findings of the Walker Study&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners also rely on unpublished findings of measles virus in tested bowel tissues taken from autistic children as support for their claim regarding measles persistence.  Petitioners’ expert Dr. Hepner expressed the opinion that the published 2002 Uhlmann findings are “reliable,” see Cedillo Tr. at 639, and her confidence in the reported positive findings of measles virus is bolstered by the preliminary findings of a study on which she is working.  Dr. Hepner discussed her current work with a team of investigators in the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Walker at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Dr. Hepner described the project as a study “to create a highly reproducible, highly sensitive, very specific . . .  experimental design to detect [measles virus] RNA in the bowel biopsies of ASD patients.”  Id. at 634A-635A.  She stated that the preliminary findings of the study, which were presented as an abstract at the June 2006 International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR), confirm the presence of vaccine strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.  Id. at 635.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hepner stated that while positive controls (specifically “an artificial laboratory construct” of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.  Id. at 658, 663, 674-675.  The experimental controls are patients who do not have ASDs but have gastrointestinal symptoms.  Id. at 675.  The experimental group includes ASD patients who have “[inflammatory bowel disease]-like symptoms, but not all of whom have received the MMR vaccine.”  Id. at 676.  She described the preliminary results of the experiments as “a technical achievement” because the investigators “believe that they have developed some assays to detect [measles virus] in this cohort of patients in biopsied tissue that is vaccine strain specific.”  Id. at 682.  But Dr. Hepner declined to “draw any conclusions about the biological significance” of the investigators’ findings.  Id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, respondent’s expert Dr. Bustin expressed some concern about the preliminary PCR results reported in the Walker abstract presented at the IMFAR conference and discussed in Dr. Hepner’s testimony.  Dr. Bustin’s chief concern after reviewing the slides from the poster presentation is that there is evidence from the location of the bands in the experimental gel that the obtained results are not specific for the intended target.  See id. at 1955A-1958A.  Because the experiment did not include a negative control, a proper determination of what the observed bands show cannot be made. See id. at 1958.  In the absence of both positive and negative controls during a PCR run, Dr. Bustin stated that he “[could not] have any confidence” in the test results.  Id. at 1959A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimony during the Cedillo hearing of the parties’ experts, Dr. Hepner for petitioners and Dr. Bustin and Dr. Ward for respondent, made clear that standard laboratory practice requires that positive samples (that always contain the targeted material), negative samples (that never contain the targeted material), experimental samples (the subjects with an exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material), and control samples (the subjects without the exposure of interest tested for the presence of the targeted material) are run during each experiment.  See Cedillo Tr. at 620A, 621A, 627A, 677 (Dr. Hepner); id. at 1842 (Dr. Ward); id. at 1959A (Dr. Bustin). The use of the positive and negative controls provides information about the internal consistency of the experiments.  Informed that test results without the use of these controls during PCR experiments may not be reliable, the undersigned cannot place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study (addressed by petitioners’ experts Drs. Corbier, Hepner, and Krigsman), specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pp 175-176&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners’ claim that the measles virus can persist in the gut of certain vaccinated children and cause inflammation is based on reported findings of persistent measles virus in the biopsied gut tissue taken from autistic children who have received the MMR vaccine and developed gastrointestinal symptoms.  Petitioners’ reliance, however, on the published reports of positive test results, the unpublished positive findings of the preliminary Walker study, and the positive lab results obtained by Unigenetics lab from biopsied gut tissue taken from children involved in the OAP litigation is unavailing.  Strong evidence, including highly credible expert testimony, indicates there were numerous irregularities in the testing procedures.  Those irregularities compromised the integrity of the conducted tests and have rendered the test results unreliable.  Underscoring the unreliability of the test results is the inability of other laboratories (that is, accredited laboratories not affiliated with either Dr. Wakefield, his colleagues, or the Unigenetics lab) to replicate the reported findings in gastrointestinal tissues or blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners’ theory is based on the characteristics of the wild-type measles virus rather than on the characteristics of the attenuated vaccine-strain measles virus. Petitioners’ theory is further based on unreliable reports of positive measles findings.  The bases for petitioners’ theory that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can lead to the development of autism are unsound.  Petitioners have failed to offer reliable support for the proposition that the MMR vaccine can cause autism and have failed to meet their burden of proof under the first prong of the Althen standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hazlehursts also argue that the special master disregarded critical evidence regarding the reliability of the Walker group&amp;#39;s test results, in violation of the Vaccine Act&amp;#39;s requirement to consider &amp;quot;all . . . relevant medical and scientific evidence.&amp;quot; 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b)(1). They assert that the special master ignored evidence— including testimony from Dr. Hepner and exhibits from the Walker group&amp;#39;s 2006 IMFAR poster presentation—showing that the Walker group used genetic sequencing to verify its test results. If the special master had given that evidence proper consideration, the Hazlehursts argue, she would have found that the Walker study reliably detected persistent vaccine-strain measles virus in the bowels of autistic children. The Hazlehursts therefore assert that the special master&amp;#39;s decision to accord little weight to the Walker group&amp;#39;s test results was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an initial matter, even if the special master had made no explicit reference to the evidence that the Walker group used genetic sequencing, we would presume that she considered that evidence. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Daig Corp., 789 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (&amp;quot;We presume that a fact finder reviews all the evidence presented unless he explicitly expresses otherwise.&amp;quot;). In this case, however, it is not necessary to rely on that presumption, as the special master&amp;#39;s opinion specifically refers to that evidence. Discussing Dr. Krigsman&amp;#39;s testimony, the special master explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krigsman stated that the preliminary findings of that [Walker group] study show that based on the obtained PCR results, measles virus is present in the biopsied gastrointestinal tissue taken from patients with autism and bowel disease and examined by Dr. Krigsman. Dr. Krigsman acknowledged, however, as did Dr. Hepner, that not all of the samples had been sequenced for vaccine strain measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *139 (citations to exhibits and testimony omitted). Thus, the special master clearly understood the testimony that some, though not all, of the Walker group&amp;#39;s samples were sequenced to confirm vaccine-strain specificity. Moreover, the exhibits that the special master cited in her opinion included the June 2006 IMFAR abstract and IMFAR poster presentation—the very documents that the Hazlehursts contend were &amp;quot;ignored.&amp;quot; We thus cannot conclude that the special master failed to consider the evidence in question, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-13(b)(1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, an examination of the cited exhibits and testimony reveals inconsistent and preliminary data that provides only minimal support for the petitioners&amp;#39; claim that the Walker group confirmed the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus, as opposed to wild-type measles virus. While the abstract states that &amp;quot;PCR analysis on. . . tissue from an initial 82 patients showed that 70 (85%) were positive&amp;quot; for measles virus, the poster presentation states that &amp;quot;PCR analysis on . . . tissue from an initial 86 patients showed that 57 (66%) were positive&amp;quot; for measles virus. With respect to sequencing, the abstract observes that &amp;quot;[f]ourteen [samples] have been verified by DNA sequence,&amp;quot; but it does not state whether the sequencing was vaccine-strain specific. The poster presentation, on the other hand, states: &amp;quot;Thirty five [samples] have currently been verified by DNA sequence. Six of the thirty five MV [measles virus] positive [samples] bear sequence that is specific to vaccine strain MV.&amp;quot; That information, which suggests that only a small number of samples were successfully sequenced for vaccine-strain measles virus, is confirmed by Dr. Krigsman&amp;#39;s testimony: &amp;quot;All we could say at the time of this poster is that, as far as vaccine-strain-specific sequencing positivity, a total of six specimens [] were positive . . . . So genetic material that was specific for vaccine-strain measles virus was positive in six.&amp;quot;[ 3 ] Given that the Walker group&amp;#39;s data reflects only a small amount of vaccine-strain-specific sequencing, it was not inappropriate for the special master to include only a brief discussion of the Walker group&amp;#39;s sequencing efforts in her opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special master&amp;#39;s decision to accord little weight to the Walker group&amp;#39;s data was largely based on the study&amp;#39;s other shortcomings and was thus well within her discretion in weighing the evidence. Most significantly, the special master found that the Walker group&amp;#39;s research was unpublished, preliminary, and incomplete. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *124-25, *139, *150. Embodied only in a poster presentation, the Walker study was not subject to peer review and therefore has not been subjected to scrutiny from the greater scientific community. See id. at *16, quoting Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 594 (1993) (&amp;quot;The fact of publication (or lack thereof) in a peer reviewed journal thus will be a relevant, though not dispositive, consideration in assessing the scientific validity of a particular technique or methodology.&amp;quot;). In fact, Dr. Krigsman and Dr. Hepner repeatedly described the Walker group&amp;#39;s data as &amp;quot;partial&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;preliminary.&amp;quot; As the special master observed, Dr. Hepner testified that she &amp;quot;certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t draw any conclusions about the biological significance&amp;quot; of the Walker group&amp;#39;s test results at that early stage. In particular, Dr. Hepner noted the lack of a &amp;quot;proper control source&amp;quot; of tissue samples from children without autism spectrum disorders. She explained that the Walker group&amp;#39;s current data does &amp;quot;not give us any information yet about this cohort of patients relative to a different cohort of patients.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special master also expressed misgivings about the Walker group&amp;#39;s use of controls in its study. The special master noted that &amp;quot;while positive controls (specifically `an artificial laboratory construct&amp;#39; of wild-type measles virus) have been run in each experimental run in the study, no negative controls have been run to date because the investigators are still looking for suitable negative controls.&amp;quot; Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125. In their reply brief, the Hazlehursts dispute the special master&amp;#39;s statement that &amp;quot;no negative controls have been run.&amp;quot; They argue that negative &amp;quot;technical&amp;quot; controls were run with every sample to check for contamination and to assure the reliability of the PCR testing, even though the Walker group lacked certain &amp;quot;experimental&amp;quot; controls, namely, control samples of tissue from children who tested negative for autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The record is unclear as to precisely what negative controls were run. Although Dr. Hepner testified that &amp;quot;no-template negative controls&amp;quot; were run &amp;quot;as a control for contamination,&amp;quot; she also stated that the Walker group was still &amp;quot;in the process of procuring samples that would be appropriate negative controls.&amp;quot; She further noted that &amp;quot;the negative control at this point generally has been a no-template control because we don&amp;#39;t have access to the right material.&amp;quot; The confusion is compounded by Dr. Bustin&amp;#39;s testimony that he could not rule out the possibility of contamination—suggested by several indicators of unidentified genetic material in the Walker group&amp;#39;s poster presentation—because &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no negative control there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is clear from the record is that, at the time of the omnibus autism hearings, certain key controls used by the Walker group were incomplete and in flux. Most critical is the undisputed lack of a sufficient control group of non-autistic children with which to compare the positive findings in autistic children. If the Walker group were to find persistent measles virus at comparable rates in both autistic and non-autistic children, for example, such a finding would significantly undermine the petitioners&amp;#39; theory that persistent measles virus contributes to the causation of autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, Dr. Hepner&amp;#39;s testimony suggests that the Walker group was also seeking a different type of positive control to rule out the possibility of cross-contamination. That evidence further underscores the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of the Walker group&amp;#39;s results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Court of Federal Claims, we do not believe that the Walker group&amp;#39;s small amount of vaccine-strain-specific genetic sequencing &amp;quot;carries enough weight to overcome the special master&amp;#39;s conclusion that the Walker group&amp;#39;s results were preliminary, unpublished, and not entitled to substantial weight.&amp;quot; Hazlehurst, 88 Fed. Cl. at 488. We therefore find no error in the special master&amp;#39;s determination that she could not &amp;quot;place much weight on the preliminary findings of Walker study . . . specifically the alleged findings of vaccine-strain measles virus in some of the bowel biopsies that were tested.&amp;quot; Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "seasoned ground beef" contains less than 35 percent beef - the other 65 percent of the meat-like mixture is: water, isolated oat product, salt, chili pepper, onion powder, tomato powder, oats (wheat), soy lecithin, sugar, spices, maltodextrin, soybean oil (anti-dusting agent), garlic powder, autolyzed yeast extract, citric acid, caramel color, cocoa powder (processed with alkali), silicon dioxide (anti-caking agent), natural flavors, yeast, modified corn starch, natural smoke flavor, salt, sodium phosphate, less than 2% of beef broth, potassium phosphate and potassium lactate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I find objectionable about that is the 35% beef — if they could get that down to 0% I might be tempted to try their food someday.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s the cardboard cutout tactic — it turns out that cardboard versions of us put up much less of a fight than the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid Stephen Asma has committed the same error. He has written a long, meandering essay that accuses the New Atheists of having a &lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-New-Atheists-Narrow/126027/"&gt;narrow worldview&lt;/a&gt; because, he thinks, all we know about is Christianity and Islam. What about Buddhism, he asks, or animism? And then he does tell us some interesting things about Buddhism and animism, but they're all entirely irrelevant, because he has completely missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asma errs by thinking he has encapsulated the Gnu Atheists as people who reject Christianity and Islam because they do a poor job of explaining nature and guiding morality, and that therefore he can make a case for the inadequacy of that atheism by showing that there are other religions that do not consider explaining and moralizing to be their primary duties: Buddhism, for instance, is about finding psychological contentment, while animism is a reflection of mankind&amp;#39;s helplessness and lack of control. We could argue about those characterizations — Asma admits that Buddhism as practiced has supernatural and ritual elements, too, for instance — but let&amp;#39;s not, for now. I want to argue with &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; narrow and erroneous worldview of what a Gnu Atheist is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnu atheism is not simply about what isn&amp;#39;t. Our views do find expression in specific criticisms of specific faiths, but those are just the epiphenomena of a deeper set of positive values that Asma completely misses. Certainly I will make moral arguments against religious pathologies — Catholic priests raping children is bad — and I will judge beliefs by the foolishness of their explanations — creationist dogma is utterly absurd. But to say that is the guiding philosophy of atheism is to mistake the actions for the cause. I have one simple question you can ask of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; religion, whether it's animism or Catholicism, that will allow you to determine the Gnu Atheist position on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it true?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told people this many times. The Gnu Atheism is a positive movement that emphasizes the truth of a claim as paramount; it is our number one value. This is why you&amp;#39;re finding so many scientists who consider themselves in this movement — it&amp;#39;s because that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re trained to think about hypotheses. Also, because there are many scientists and philosophers behind this idea, I should also emphasize that we&amp;#39;re also well aware that &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; is not some magic absolute, but something we can only approach by trial and error, and that truth is something you have to work towards, not simply accept dogmatically as given by some unquestionable source…which is another difference between us and religion. A scientific truth is more complex than a colloquial truth, it&amp;#39;s requirements being that it is free of contradiction with logic and reality and supported by reason and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asma's big mistake is assuming that our central question is, &lt;b&gt;"Is it good for us?"&lt;/b&gt;, which leads him into all these pointless anecdotes about how praying makes him feel better, and how animism helps impoverished people cope with their circumstances. I don't care if religion makes someone feel better. Stacking illusions over a grim reality does not turn it sweet. I have my anecdotes, too; I remember the tragedy of my little sister's death a few years ago, and how I sat through a funeral in which the preacher declared with absolute certainty that she was in heaven, and all I felt was anger. Lies do not make me feel better. There is no consolation in fantasy. You can sugar-coat the truth as much as you want, you can make up extravagant stories of my sister living in constant joy and rapture, frolicking with lambs and puppy dogs in fields of sweet clover while angels on gentle zephyrs sing to her, and it would not give me one instant of comfort. I do not lie to myself, and other people lying to me under the delusion that it will make me happier I find unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, it's worse than that. I &lt;i&gt;despise&lt;/i&gt; people who try to swaddle truth with lies in the name of consolation. It kills ambition, the striving to make the world better in the future, and it can allow evil to lurk unchecked. Those child-raping priests persisted because people lied to themselves, telling themselves that no man of god could do something so heinous…and even when finally exposed and removed, they continued to live in denial, reassuring each other that the institution that protected those vipers really was a force for good, overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Asma is barking up the wrong tree when he thinks this is the relevant question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do we discriminate between dangerous and benign religions? That is the more fruitful question, because it invites the other world religions into the discussion. Both the developed and the developing worlds can profitably examine their unique belief systems in light of larger human values. Like Harris et al., I agree that we should employ the usual criteria of experience to make the necessary discriminations. Religious ideas that encourage dehumanization, violence, and factionalism should be reformed or diminished, while those that humanize, console, and inspire should be fostered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He really doesn&amp;#39;t get it. He could show me a religion that is nothing but sweetness and light, happiness and good thoughts and equality for all, and it wouldn&amp;#39;t matter: the one question I would ask is, &amp;quot;Is it true?&amp;quot; It wouldn&amp;#39;t matter if he could show empirically that adopting this hypothetical faith leads to world peace, the voluntary abolishment of crime, the disappearance of dental caries, and that every child on the planet would get their very own pony — I&amp;#39;d still battle it with every fierce and angry word I could speak and type if it wasn&amp;#39;t also shown to be a true and accurate description of the world. Some of us, at least, will refuse to drink the Kool-Aid, no matter how much sugar they put in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the case that &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; religion describes itself as benign. Ask the true believers in even the most hateful, violent faiths, and they will all say they are workin for the betterment of their people. Women &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; wearing burkas, they will say, and they're &lt;i&gt;happier&lt;/i&gt; when liberated from civic responsibilities, like voting, or doing a man's job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asma does go on at length about the virtues of animism in the third world, where it is a coping mechanism to live with difficult lives and high-risk environments, but I think he's also wearing those rosy glasses that transmit lies to his nervous system. It makes them happier, he claims, but African animists still die of starvation, thirst, and disease, and African animists are using their faiths to accuse children of witchcraft to justify setting them on fire, or butchering unfortunate albinos to use their body parts in magical rituals. So even his examples of a benign religion don't hold up unless we close our eyes to much of what's done in their name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asma concludes with a typical unsupported plea; atheism's "proponents need to have a more nuanced and global understanding of religion." No, we don't. Show us that it's true, first, and then we can talk about nuance, and implementation, and consequences. Telling us how it makes some people feel good doesn't even begin to address our core objections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's time to dust off your Darwin costume again: less than a month remains before Darwin Day 2011! Colleges and universities, schools, libraries, museums, churches, civic groups, and just plain folks across the country -- and the world -- are preparing to celebrate Darwin Day, on or around February 12, in honor of the life and work of Charles Darwin. These events provide a marvelous opportunity not only to celebrate Darwin's birthday but also to engage in public outreach about science, evolution, and the importance of evolution education -- which is especially needed with assaults on evolution education currently ongoing in Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas.

If you're a Splendid Fairy-Wren (Malurus splendens, native to Australia), your best bet might be to frighten the object of your affection. 

You've learned all about the birds and the bees; now it's time to learn from them.

Lots of research has shown that animals reduce their sexual behaviors when predators are around. After all, it isn't just potential mates who would see or hear an elaborate mating display, but also potential predators. The male splendid fairy-wren does something a little bit unusual, though. Gray Butcherbirds (Cracticus torquatus) are known to prey upon splendid fairy-wrens and their nests. Almost without fail, whenever the call of the gray butcherbird is heard, male fairy-wrens begin singing! Specifically, they sing a short trill referred to as a "Type 2 song." In fact, researchers Greig and Pruett-Jones have gone so far as to refer to the double-call as a "duet."

What would cause the male splendid fairy-wrens to respond to the calls of their predators in such a strange way? One possibility is that the response of the fairy-wrens is an alarm call, meant to warn others nearby of the presence of a predator. One experiment ruled out that possibility, though: male splendid fairy-wrens give their Type 2 songs in response to hearing the vocalization of the butcherbird, but not in the presence of silent butcherbirds. Another possibility is that the Type 2 songs are meant to scare the butcherbirds away, but another experiment indicated that this wasn't the case either, as males were no more likely to sing their Type 2 songs upon seeing a silent butcherbird. It seems, then, that there is something special about the vocalization of the butcherbird that causes the splendid fairy-wren to sing its Type 2 song.

It could be that the Type 2 song functions as a territorial display, to keep other males away. If the Type 2 song is used as a territorial display, Greig and Pruett-Jones predicted, then males would respond to Type 2 songs coming from encroaching males in an aggressive way. This, however, is not the case either.

Alternatively, it might be the case that the Type 2 song functions as a mating display: a way to attract the attention of the females. In this case, the Type 2 song may occur following the butcherbird call simply because that predatory call is particularly salient; in other words, if females become more aware of their surroundings after a butcherbird call, then they will be better able to detect the males' Type 2 song that immediately follows. This predicts that female splendid fairy-wrens should become more alert and attentive following the butcherbird call. If this is the case - if butcherbird calls essentially facilitate the detection of the Type 2 song - then females should be more responsive to the Type 2 song when it follows a predatory butcherbird call, rather than in isolation.

These verbs have caused a four-decades-long headache for theorists trying to explain how people know what should be the subject and what should be the object of a given verb. Many theorists would like to posit theories on which you put the &amp;quot;do-er&amp;quot; in subject position and the one &amp;quot;done to&amp;quot; in object position. But some psych verbs seem to go one way and some the other.

There are basically only three theoretical possibilities:

a) There&amp;#39;s no general rule that will tell you whether the experiencer of an emotion should be the subject or object of a given verb.

b) There&amp;#39;s a general rule that tells you the experiencer should be the subject (or, on other theories, the object), and then there are some exceptions.

c) There are no exceptions. There are two kinds of psych verbs that actually mean very different things. Each group follows a particular rule: one sends the experiencer to subject; the other, to object.

I started out as a fan of theory (b). The results of my own work have pushed me in the direction of (c). The only theory that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure is wrong is (a). There are a lot of reasons I think (a) is wrong. One has to do with Broca&amp;#39;s aphasia.

Broca&amp;#39;s aphasia

People with Broca&amp;#39;s aphasia -- typically caused by a stroke or brain injury -- have difficulty with grammar but are relatively good at remembering what individual words mean. Classically, Broca&amp;#39;s aphasia was thought to result from damage to Broca&amp;#39;s area, though I&amp;#39;ve heard that association is not as solid as once believed.

Some well-known language-related areas of the brain.

Either way, Maria Mercedes Pinango published a study in 2000 looking at how well Broca&amp;#39;s aphasics understand psych verbs. She found that they had particular trouble with experiencer-object verbs (delights/angers/frightens) ... unless the verbs were in passive form (Mary is delighted/angered/frightened by John), in which case they had more trouble with the experiencer-subject verbs.

There are a lot of reasons this could be. The main aspect of the finding that interests me here is that this is *not* what you&amp;#39;d expect on theory (a), since on that theory, all psych verbs are more or less the same and there&amp;#39;s no particular reason Broca&amp;#39;s aphasia or anything else should impact one more than the other.

One worry one might have about this study was that it was published as a book chapter and not in a journal, and book chapters don&amp;#39;t (usually) undergo the same review process. I don&amp;#39;t personally know that much about aphasia or how one goes about testing aphasics, so it&amp;#39;s hard for me to review Pinango&amp;#39;s methods. More importantly, there weren&amp;#39;t many participants in the study (these participants are not easy to find), so one would like replication.

Replication

As it happens, Cynthia Thompson and Miseon Lee recently published just such a replication (well, they published it in 2009, but one doesn&amp;#39;t always hear about papers right away). It&amp;#39;s a nice study with 5 Broca&amp;#39;s aphasics, published in the Journal of Neurolinguistics. They tested both sentence comprehension and sentence production, finding that while passive sentences were harder overall, experiencer-subject verbs (like/hate/fear) were easier in the active form and experiencer-object verbs (delight/anger/frighten) were easier in the passive form. This effect was much more pronounced in sentence production than comprehension (in the latter case, it was not strictly significant), most likely because comprehension is easier.

Again, these are not the results you expect if the rules that tell you who should be a subject and who should be an object are verb-by-verb, since then there&amp;#39;s no reason brain damage should affect one class of verbs as opposed to another (since there are no verb classes).* What exactly it does mean is much trickier. Give me another 20-30 years, and hopefully I&amp;#39;ll have an answer.

*Actually, I can come up with a just-so story that saves theory (a). But it&amp;#39;s certainly not what you would expect, and I believe there are a lot of other data from other paradigms that speak against theory (a).

It was a nice overview of many of the important aspects of this tool, and I won’t go into those again here–you should check that out. Andrei knows those details quite well!

And at the time we also mentioned their webinar was coming up. We were unable to attend that, though, because we were doing workshops at The Stowers Institute. I was delighted to find that their webcast is now available to watch in full. It’s about 40 minutes long and covers much more than my 5-minute appetizer could do.  It details many practical aspects of how to use iRefWeb effectively.

Because they’ve done all the prep work for me, I don’t need to spend much time on the structural and functional features here. What I would like to do is draw your attention to a different aspect of their work. Their project draws together protein interaction data from a variety of source databases–including some of our favorites such as MINT and IntAct (for which we have training suites available for purchase).  They then used the iRefWeb processes and projects to evaluate and consider the issues around curation of protein-protein interaction data, and recently published those results. That’s what I’ll be focusing on in the post.

Every so often a database flame-war erupts in the bioinformatics community. Generally it involves someone writing a review of databases and/or their content. These evaluations are sometimes critical, sometimes not–but often what happens is that the database providers feel that their site is either mis-represented, or unfairly chastised, or at a minimum incompletely detailed on their mission and methods. I remember one  flambé developed not too long ago around a paper by our old friend from our Proteome days–Mike Cusick–and his colleagues (and we talked about that here). As the OpenHelix team has been involved in plenty of software and curation teams, we know how these play out. And we have sympathy for both the authors and the database providers in these situations.

So when the iRefWeb site pointed me to their new paper I thought: oh-oh…shall I wear my asbestos pantsuit for this one???  The title is Literature curation of protein interactions: measuring agreement across major public databases.  Heh–how’s that working out for ya?

Anyway–it turns out not to need protective gear, in my opinion. Because their project brings data from several interaction database sources, they are well-positioned to collect information about the data to compare the data sets. They clearly explain their stringent criteria, and then look at the data from different papers as it is collected across different databases.

A key point is this:

On average, two databases curating the same publication agree on 42% of  their interactions. The discrepancies between the sets of proteins  annotated from the same publication are typically less pronounced, with  the average agreement of 62%, but the overall trend is similar.

So although there is overlap, different database have different data stored. This won’t be a surprise to most of us in bioinformatics. But I think it is something that end users need to understand. The iRefWeb team acknowledges that there are many sources of difference among data curation teams. Some curate only certain species. Some include all data from high-throughput studies, others take only high-confidence subsets of that data. And it’s fine for different teams to slice the data how they want. Users just need to be aware of this.

It seems that in general there’s more agreement between curators on non-vertebrate model organism data sets than there is for vertebrates. Isoform complexity is a major problem among the hairy organisms, it turns out–and this affects how the iRefWeb team scored the data sets. And as always when curation is evaluated–the authors of papers are sometimes found to be at fault for providing some vagueness to their data sets.

The iRefWeb tools offer you a way to assess what’s available from a given paper in a straightforward manner. In their webinar, you can hear them describe that ~30 minutes in. If you use protein-protein interaction data, you should check that out.

Caveat emptor for protein-protein interaction data (well, and all data in databases, really). But iRefWeb provides an indication of what is available and what the sources are–all of it traceable to the original papers.

The paper is a nice awareness of the issues, not specific criticism of any of the sources. They note the importance of the curation standards encouraged by the Proteomics Standards Initiative–Molecular Interaction (PSI-MI) ontologies and efforts. And they use their paper to raise awareness of where there may be dragons. It seems that dragons are quite an issue for multi-protein complex data.

Your mileage may vary. If you are a data provider, you may want to have protective gear for this paper. But as someone not connected directly to any of the projects, I thought it was reasonable. And something to keep in mind as a user of data–especially as more “big data” proteomics projects start rolling out more and more data.

I have not misinterpreted John's view of science. Rather, I have questioned why he would state that science assumes natural explanations for all phenomena on the one hand, then ask believers to corroborate supernatural explanations through science. -cl&lt;/blockquote&gt;I must admit this is a great question. The objection is that if I demand that supernatural explanations must abide by the rules of science which only admit natural explanations, then supernatural explanations by definition don't have a chance. This is definitely a quandary of sorts. Let me respond.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should note first of all that science &lt;i&gt;qua&lt;/i&gt; science must look for natural explanations because that's what science does. It cannot do otherwise lest it be subservient to different kinds of supernatural explanations. If that's the case then there would be separate scientific methods resulting in a Mormon science, a Muslim science, a Christian science and so forth. Alvin Plantinga actually recommends that there should be a distinctively Christian science, something which &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/michael_martin/naturalism.html"&gt;Michael Martin strongly objects to&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay so far?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Granted there are probably a lot of things the sciences cannot explain, from the origin of the universe, the origin of life, and consciousness (or at least, they have difficulties in doing so). That's where there is room for faith. Until such time as the sciences can explain everything believers can still have faith. But that doesn't seem within reach, and may never happen, so there will always be room for faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the way it has to be. A believer should ask for no more than this. The sciences must look for natural explanations. There is no other alternative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, am I being hypocritical or inconsistent when I demand that believers should corroborate supernatural explanations through the sciences? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, for a few good reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Theistic explanations have failed miserably in every generation as science has shown these explanations unnecessary. It's this overwhelming success that leads me to think science offers much better explanations than theistic ones. So it's based on the success of science that I make my claim. I have been persuaded that supernatural explanations are a dime a dozen and debunked so many times before that I have no reason to think any additional moving of the goal posts will succeed. For once science explains something then theists move the goal posts to a different problem because science opens up new questions to be solved as it solves previous ones. So in one sense I have concluded something from science and then turned around and demanded that supernatural explanations cannot succeed by demanding they adhere to the standards of science. Theists not already persuaded as I am, will claim I'm hypocritical or inconsistent because they do not already think as I do about the sciences. In fact, believers regularly denigrate science to believe, and I find that appalling given it's success rate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So believers will not appreciate my demand until they appreciate what the sciences do for us. I'm merely saying that science works. Belief does not, which is my next point.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) What else is there but the sciences? Faith-based reasoning is best defined as "belief in search of data." There are too many different and contradictory religious claims being made. How can we settle these disputes? We cannot do so with faith-based reasoning because it only confirms what was believed in the first place. Such a method (if we can call it that) fails miserably time and again. This is best shown faulty when we see that it cannot help us decide between these different faith claims. Furthermore, I find it inconsistent and hypocritical for believers to use the sciences to debunk other religious claims who fail to use the sciences against what they themselves believe. If believers admit a science-based reasoning to debunk other religious claims then they tacitly admit doing so is fruitful and effective to examine their own religious claims. For believers to object that I'm demanding something unreasonable they must explain why they apply the sciences to the religious claims they reject.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Finally, I find nothing about my demand that should in principle lead to a rejection of theistic claims. I think supernatural explanations could be the best explanations of certain phenomena, even granting that the sciences look for natural explanations. The fact that so far supernatural explanations don't succeed is not the fault of the sciences. It's the fault of supernatural explanations. It's because there are no supernatural forces or beings. If they existed then science should be able to detect them since science is based on the five senses. There is no sixth sense. It would find it duplicitous for a god to create us with our five senses and not also provide the sensory evidence to believe if he wants us to believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this topic I have written what kind of natural phenomena would lead me to accept supernatural explanations as the best explanations in my post, &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-would-convince-me-christianity-is.html"&gt;What would convince me Christianity is true?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read other items along this topic see:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html"&gt;Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism: Clarifying the Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11595"&gt;Can Theistic Explanations Succeed?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=11046"&gt;‘God Did It’ is a Terrible Explanation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6112134284955748225?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing that I'm going to Minnesota, my excellent detectorist buddy Kenth Lärk sent me some scans of postcards from Duluth that his emigrant uncle sent home to Sweden in the early 1910s. I particularly like this image of the 1892 Union Depot, as the architecture is similar to that of the station houses along the Saltsjöbanan commuter railway that I've been riding for most of my life. It was built in the early 1890s, at a time when American architecture was en vogue in Sweden -- but in the US, the style is known as "French château". New Englanders will instantly feel at home in the oldest part of Saltsjöbaden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.duluthdepot.org"&gt;The Union Depot still stands&lt;/a&gt;. It's on the National Register of Historic Buildings and functions as a county heritage and arts center, also letting space for private events.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s a Tea Party favorite, and has been waging a pogrom-like witch hunt against climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann for years. Cuccinelli is a climate change denier, and has been hounding Mann and his research, using his power of subpoena to hamstring Mann and the University of Virginia, where  Mann did much of research (he’s now at Penn State University). Ironically, Cuccinelli has been spending quite a large passel of taxpayer money to try to prove that Mann’s research was fraudulent and therefore a waste of taxpayers’ money&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent study, Tsukiura &amp;amp; Cabeza (2011) provides an insight into this question by investigating the neural mechanism underlying the Beauty-is-Good stereotype. They were interested in the activity of the medial orbito frontal cortex (associated with positive stimuli, reward processing etc); the insular cortex (associated with negative stimuli, punishment processing etc) and the interaction between these two regions.This fMRI study required participants to engage in 3 different tasks:Face attractiveness rating (beauty judgment task)Action goodness rating (moral judgment task)Brightness rating (control condition)The 3 tasks. Click to enlargeConforming to their hypothesis, the authors found that activity in the mOFC increased linearly as a function of both attractiveness and goodness rating. Activity in the insular cortex also decreased linearly as a function of both types of ratings. In both regions, the strong correlation between the activations caused by both judgments also supports the idea that similar neural regions are engaged when we are processing attractiveness and moral goodness.Furthermore, the negative correlation between right mOFC and right insular cortex provides support for the “dual process hypothesis” of the Beauty is Good stereotype in that we display both a positive bias of attractiveness as being good and a negative bias against unattractiveness as being bad. That is to say, the stereotype is driven by two opposing mechanism whereby we tend to think that an attractive person is more moral and an unattractive person is less moral, rather than a singular bias towards attractiveness or unattractiveness.Click to enlargeOur delusion that beauty is goodness then appears to have been built into how our brain processes both type of judgments and the completeness of this delusion may surprise even the great Leo Tolstoy.Tsukiura T, &amp;amp; Cabeza R (2011).

So do all supply chain disruptions have the same effect on the focal company? Of course not, but what are the driving factors that influence the impact?

In their conceptual note Craighead et al. (2007) analyse the factors of the impact supply chain disruptions.

As many companies, the authors take the view that supply chain disruptions are inevitable and at some point in time some part of the supply chain will fail. The important question therefore is: How and why one supply chain disruption would be more severe than another

&lt;p&gt;Guess what the “other positions of responsibility and trust which are held by women” were?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, times have changed, and now &lt;a href="http://www.fbijobs.gov/115.asp"&gt;more than 2,000 women are special FBI agents. &lt;/a&gt; The absorption of women into what were traditionally “men’s jobs,” and the recognition that women had a right to go for them, is one of the great moral victories of our time, and I watched it happen.  Sadly, in much of the world that victory has yet to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, Doc Bill is trying to parlay Kink’s fame into a lucrative empire, and has established (on the urging of myself and Miranda Hale) a website for the cat, &lt;a href="http://kinkthecat.com/Kink_the_Cat/Welcome.html"&gt;kinkthecat.com&lt;/a&gt;.  There you can see photos of the lolzy creature, and read his sporadic postings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But publicity was not enough—Doc Bill wanted &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;.  And so he made this, currently holding my morning latte:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27202" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/doc-bill-is-shameless/kinkmug/"&gt;&lt;img title="Kinkmug" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/kinkmug.jpg?w=443&amp;amp;h=589" alt="" width="443" height="589"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s Doc Bill, in his characteristic Hawaiian shirt, with his beloved Kink.  He has in fact set up &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/kinkthecat"&gt;a Kink the Cat Store at CafePress&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to cash in on his kitteh.  (I doubt that Kink sees any profits!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc sent me a free mug, doubtlessly knowing that I’d publicize his store and and send business his way.  You can buy Kink mugs, tee shirts, and even (if you have a goggie you want to pwn), Kink the Cat Dog Shirts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27205" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/doc-bill-is-shameless/110_115x115_front_color-white/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27206" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/doc-bill-is-shameless/110_480x480_front_colorwhite/"&gt;&lt;img title="110_480x480_Front_ColorWhite" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/110_480x480_front_colorwhite.jpg?w=343&amp;amp;h=343" alt="" width="343" height="343"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I’ve done my duty for the free mug.  But two hints to Doc Bill: Make the logo bigger, and allow comments on Kink’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statin drugs have been surrounded by controversy for a number of reasons. On the one hand they demonstrably lower cholesterol, and the evidence has shown that they also reduce the incidence of heart attacks and strokes. The data on whether or not they reduce mortality has been less clear, although this latest data actually supports that claim. However, statins have also been blockbuster drugs for pharmaceutical companies and this has spawned concerns (some might say paranoia) that drug companies are pushing billions of dollars worth of marginally effective drugs onto the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are statins a savior or a scam? Life does not always provide nice clean answers to such simple dichotomies. The evidence clearly shows that statins work and are safe. However, pharmaceutical companies do like to present their data in the best light possible, and they need to be watched closely for this. The recent review does call them on some practices that might tend to exaggerate the utility of statins. Finally, the real question comes down to – where should we draw the line in terms of cost-benefit of a preventive measure like statins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look as this recent review of the data to see what it actually shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, for context, this Cochrane review looked specifically at statins for primary prevention – prevention of vascular events (mainly heart attacks, strokes, and overall mortality) in those who are at low risk for heart disease and who have not already had any vascular event. &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/330/7495/821.abstract"&gt;The evidence for statins for secondary prevention&lt;/a&gt;, after a heart attack, is more robust – decreasing risk of a second heart attack by about one-third. This makes sense, and is generally what we see. The higher the risk of disease the greater the potential benefit for any preventive measure, and the easier it is to measure this benefit in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as the risk of the disease becomes smaller, the risk-benefit ratio and cost-benefit ratio of preventive measures goes down. At some point the side effects from the treatment become greater than the risk of the disease being prevented. Generally clinical trials divide risk into two broad categories – primary prevention and secondary prevention. However, in reality there is a spectrum of risk. A person without a history of a vascular event may still be at high risk if they have a lot of risk factors – hypertension, age, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. And of course, since statins are cholesterol lowering agents, high cholesterol at baseline is a reasonable marker for the potential of benefit from statins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statins also have to be compared to other measures – like diet and exercise – for relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. No one doubts that it would be best if every patient had a healthy diet and weight and exercised regularly. Some argue that statins should be reserved for those who fail these lifestyle interventions, or who have genetically high cholesterol refractory to diet and exercise. The reality is that it is very difficult to get individual patients to change their behavior. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21249647"&gt;a recent Cochrane review &lt;/a&gt;concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interventions using  counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total  or CHD mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be  effective in reducing mortality in high-risk hypertensive and diabetic  populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked  unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of  dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions  have limited use in general populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not very encouraging. Clearly we need to work on societal interventions and improving patient interventions to achieve a healthier lifestyle as a society. But also it is clear that lifestyle intervention is not a quick or easy fix, and so there will continue to be a role for medical intervention in vascular prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statins for Primary Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Cochrane reviewers looked at the evidence for primary prevention they found that many trials included patients at high risk, or did not measure LDL levels. Essentially they felt that the data was contaminated in such a way as to exaggerate the benefit for primary prevention. Their review sought to correct those biases. They reviewed the data from 14 trials involving 34 272 patients. What they found was that total mortality had a relative risk reduction of 17%, risk of heart attacks was reduced by 28%, and strokes by 22%. In low risk patients the number needed to treat in order to prevent one death per year was 1000. The review also did not show any additional adverse events in those treated vs placebo groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors do not challenge the legitimacy of these results. The data is fairly robust – there is a reduction in risk of death and vascular events from statins in primary prevention. Study author, Dr. Shah Ebrahim, &lt;a href="http://www.theheart.org/article/1174743.do"&gt;is quoted by Heartwire as saying&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the hard end points of all deaths and coronary deaths,  the effects are consistent with both benefit and with the play of  chance. But importantly, the absolute benefits are really rather  small—1000 people have to be treated for one year to prevent one death.  It is probably a real effect, but it means a lot of people have to be  treated to gain this small benefit. As we don’t know the harms, it seems  wrong-minded to me to treat everyone with a statin. In these  circumstances, lifestyle changes and stopping smoking would be far  preferable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is where the controversy comes in. Other researchers think the authors are making conclusions that go beyond their own evidence. Heartwire also quoted Dr. Colin Baigent, a clinical researcher from Oxford, as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I object to the conclusions they have drawn from their review. They  say there is not good evidence of benefit, but their own data show  significant reductions in deaths and cardiac events. They didn’t show any increase in adverse events in  their review, but they then say the benefit is not worth the risk. That  doesn’t make sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does make for an interesting science-based medicine conversation. In this case the two sides largely agree on the data, but differ in terms of how to apply that data to the practice of medicine. This, I feel, can be a very constructive controversy. This is exactly the kind of question that should be agonized over by experts. While I think the Cochrane reviewers are displaying a negative bias against statins, they do provide balance to the pro-statin bias of pharmaceutical companies who sell statins. In the end, the data is out there and practitioners and patients will be better informed in making decisions about statin use. I am concerned about media reporting of this issue. It is easy to oversimplify the take-home message as “statins do not work” and I have already read commentaries quoting this study to support that position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My read of this evidence is that there is solid evidence that statins have a real benefit for primary prevention. This benefit is small, which is exactly what I would predict for a preventive measure in a low-risk population. The data also show that statins are safe. The major risk is for the development of an inflammatory muscle disease, but that is very rare. For interventions that prevent death – that lower mortality – I think even small benefits are worthwhile. Further, having a heart attack or stroke, even if it is not a fatal event, has a very negative effect on quality of life. Taken together, one person per year out of several hundred taking statins for primary prevention will avoid a heart attack, stroke, or death. From a purely medical point of view, that sound pretty good to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems reasonable is to use statins for primary prevention in those who have some risk factors for vascular disease, in patients with genetically high cholesterol, and in those with high cholesterol or significant risk factors in whom lifestyle counseling has not yielded adequate results. Try diet and exercise first – and always in conjunction with medication, but statins are a reasonable choice in selected patients, even for primary prevention. We could use more studies to better delineate where to draw that line, but that will be difficult as any difference in outcome is likely to be slight and therefore massive trials will be needed to get statistically significant results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost effectiveness is a tougher issue, because we then have to arbitrarily decide what a human life is worth in terms of medical expense. This issue has become more acute as health-care costs rise and everyone is looking for ways to cut back. What I have not seen is a calculation of the cost of statins for primary prevention vs the cost savings from reduced vascular events. Having a stroke or heart attack is expensive, and pays for a lot of prevention. The question is – exactly where is the line crossed in terms of the vascular risks of the population being treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that many statins are now becoming available as generics, with a marked reduction in cost. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21090830"&gt;There is already a Spanish analysis&lt;/a&gt; showing that the availability of generics is making statin treatment more cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent Cochrane review of statin use for primary prevention supports the conclusion that statins are safe and effective in reducing vascular events and overall mortality even in primary prevention. The benefits are statistically small, which is expected for a preventive measure in a low risk population. It is still unclear where to draw the line in terms of which patients should receive statins, but these data will help practitioners and patients make individualized decisions about cholesterol management and vascular prophylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is ultimately a judgment call, the results of this study can be spun to a variety of conclusions. The study authors chose to present an overall negative conclusion – that the effect size is too small to be worth it. While other experts, looking at the same data, have come to the opposite conclusion – that statins are worth it. It is important to emphasize that the debate is not about whether or not statins have a real effect – they do, but about the cost-benefit of statins as an intervention for primary prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could also argue that Cochrane reviewers, given that their purpose is to provide objective and thorough reviews of existing evidence for specific clinical questions, should take a more neutral approach to interpreting the data. This is not the first Cochrane review discussed on SBM that can be criticized for taking a decidedly biased approach to the evidence in their conclusions. This should prompt some soul-searching, in my opinion, on the pat of the Cochrane collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it be called "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) or "integrative medicine" (IM), its infiltration into various academic medical centers has been one of the more alarming developments I've noted over the last several years. The reason is that "integrative" medicine is all too often in reality nothing more than "integrating" pseudoscience with science, quackery with medicine. After all, when you "integrate" something like &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; or therapeutic touch (TT), which basically assert that there is mystical, magical energy source (called the "universal source" by &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; practitioners, for example) that practitioners can tap into and channel into patients for healing effect, you are in essence integrating a prescientific understanding of the world with science, religious faith healing (which, let's face it, is all that &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; is), and magic with reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would medical institutions ostensibly based on science do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know, but I know it's happening. There are many forces that conspire to insert sectarian versions of medicine into bastions of scientific medicine. These include cultural relativism leading to a reluctance to call quackery quackery; financial forces such as the Bravewell Collaborative, which funds a &lt;a href="http://www.bravewell.org/transforming_healthcare/changing_physician_education/cahcim_members/"&gt;number of IM programs at academic centers&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NCCAM); and a variety of other factors. It's been a depressing slide, and periodically I wonder just how much more pseudoscience can be "integrated" into medical schools and academic medical centers or how much further medical schools can go in pandering to nonsense. I'm not wondering anymore, at last for now. If you want to see "integration," behold the &lt;a href="http://theintegratorblog.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=691&amp;amp;Itemid=189"&gt;academic "integration" model&lt;/a&gt; championed by Georgetown University, a school of science-based medicine, and Bastyr University, a school of naturopathy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/the_integration_of_pseudoscience_into_me.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/the_integration_of_pseudoscience_into_me.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/nVmK1JVhi_w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296047012297"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4011">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5241ae1155d9a786</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Boots"/><category term="CNHC"/><category term="homeopathy"/><category term="MHRA"/><category term="regulation"/><category term="Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority"/><title type="html">Pseudo-regulation: another chance to save the MHRA from looking idiotic</title><published>2011-01-26T12:56:52Z</published><updated>2011-01-26T12:56:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4011" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.dcscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/#follow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jump to follow-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to be forced to return to the world’s most boring delusion, homeopathy.  It is boring because the battle to inform people how daft it is has been almost won. Now not a single Bachelors degree in homeopathy appears in UCAS, compared with &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19"&gt;at least five in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. But the battle is not quite won with the UK Government. This post is not so much about homeopathy as about the failures of the Government and the MHRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA), has just launched yet another consultation and I have felt obliged to waste an entire Sunday writing a response to it, I can’t imagine that any scientist would disagree much with what I have written, but most of them have far better ways to spend their time than bothering about the lunatic fringes of medicine. No doubt most of the responses will come from people who make money from homeopathy, Not just the homeopaths on the High Street, but also the very rich companies like Boiron and Weleda who make enormous profits from selling pills that contain nothing but a bit of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The documents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation concerns what should be done, about homeopathy in the wake of the scarifying report of the House of Commons Select Committee [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/scitech-evidence-check-homeopathy-2010.pdf"&gt;get pdf&lt;/a&gt;], and the governments response to that report [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/government-response-to-scitech-report.pdf"&gt;get pdf&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The MHRA’s request for consultation is &lt;a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Consultations/Medicinesconsultations/Othermedicinesconsultations/CON105929"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Download the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/MHRA-consultation.pdf"&gt;consultation document&lt;/a&gt;. You can download my full response [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/MHRA-consultation-response.pdf"&gt;get pdf&lt;/a&gt;], Please write your own response and send it to &lt;a href="mailto:andreafarmer@mhra.gsi.gov.uk"&gt;andreafarmer@mhra.gsi.gov.uk&lt;/a&gt; before February 17th. Feel free to plagiarise anything you find here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good response is from Healthwatch, [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/MHRA-homeopathy-reg-response-HW.pdf"&gt;download pdf&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And an excellent response  by Prof John C. McLachlan [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/MHRA-Consultation-on-the-Review-of-the-Medicines-Act-JMCL.pdf"&gt;download pdf&lt;/a&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’ll filll in some of the background and outline why I think the MHRA still hasn’t understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Medicines Act 1968 and PLRs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Medicines Act (1968) was passed in the wake of the thalidomide disaster. It required evidence that medicines work and that they are safe. It was not possible to check all existing medicines by the time the Act was implemented in 1971, so, as a temporary measure, many medicines, including homeopathic stuff, were give a &amp;quot;public licence of right&amp;quot; (PLR). Forty years later they have mostly vanished. But not for homeopathy. The PLR is the licence that allows homeopaths to break all the rules. They still exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MHRA cocked it up in 2006&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story starts with the National Regulation Scheme for homeopathic junk that was introduced by the MHRA in 2006. This allowed, for the first time, indications to be put on the labels of the bottles of sugar pills. There were howls of outrage from just about every scientific organisation (the medical establishment was, as usual, more pusillanimous, with some honourable exceptions). The history is related here in the following posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=32"&gt;The MHRA breaks its founding principle: it is an intellectual disgrace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=115"&gt;The Royal Society speaks out on CAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=30"&gt;Learned Societies speak out against CAM, and the MHRA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=28"&gt;The MHRA loses the plot: it allows mislabelling of Arnica gel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=108"&gt;House of Lords slams homeopathy and the MHRA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=29"&gt;MHRA admits herbal medicines unproven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Science and Technology Select Committee report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an admirable effort, It extracted, with some difficulty, admissions from Boots’ professional standards director that the sold pills while knowing that they didn’t work. It also squeezed out of the then Health Minister, Mike O’Brien an admission that they don’t work, Less surprisingly, the head of the MHRA agreed that they don’t work. So it is unanimous (apart, of course, from those who make money from selling things that don’t work). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about Boots’ Professional standards, take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=141"&gt;Mis-education at Boots the Chemist&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=203"&gt;The Vitamin B scam. Don’t trust Boots&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=223"&gt;Boots reaches new level of dishonesty with CoQ10 promotion&lt;/a&gt;, to name but a few.  The oral sessions of the committee were notable for the squirming evasiveness of most of the answers to simple questions.  An account can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2507"&gt;Comedy gold in parliament and tragedy from Prince of Wales: editorial in British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Government’s response to the report&lt;/strong&gt; was mostly as truly pathetic bit of official waffle, like those letters you get when you write to your Member of Parliament. But it did contain one good thing.&amp;quot;In order for the public to make informed choices, it is therefore vitally important that the scientific evidence base for homeopathy is clearly explained and available.&amp;quot; (though even that statement is attributed to John Beddington, the Government’s Chief Scientific advisor, rather than something the Government thinks essential).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;“The MHRA will review the labelling requirements under the NRS to ensure that these deliver clarity as to the status of products and their composition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The proposals in the MHRA Consultation document’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of good things in the proposals.  The MHRA proposes to end PLRs (decades overdue, but nonetheless welcome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MHRA proposes to stop ‘regulating’ (ho ho)  “Bach Flower Remedies” as medicines (but seems happy to classify them as food Supplements, another weasel description to evade sensible regulation).  That’s sensible because they aren’t medicines. Homeopathic pills most certainly aren’t medicines either but the MHRA seems to have difficulty grasping that, and wants to treat them quite differently from “Flower remedies”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More honest labelling was about the only sensible thing recommended by the Government’s response. On this topic the MHRA proposals verge on the laughable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present the labelling allowed under the NRS includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A homeopathic medicinal product used within the homeopathic tradition for the symptomatic relief of ….”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is proposed to change this to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A homeopathic medicinal product licensed only on the basis of safety, quality and use within the homeopathic tradition”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &lt;em&gt;“A homeopathic medicinal product used within the homeopathic tradition for the symptomatic relief of……”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Spot the difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is utterly inadequate. In fact it verges on the pathetic (and on the dishonest).  Here is an extract from &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/MHRA-consultation-response.pdf"&gt;my full response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sad to say these proposals to remedy the labelling problem are wholly inadequate. They are almost as deceptive as the originals. These labels don‘t come anywhere near to fulfilling the requirement in the government‘s response which said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;In order for the public to make informed choices, it is therefore vitally important that the scientific evidence base for homeopathy is clearly explained and available&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, oh why, cannot the MHRA bring itself to simply tell the truth? It seems to be so stifled by some perversion of political correctness that it is unable to do what it must know is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing indicates more clearly the ludicrous state of the NRS than the &lt;a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con049307.pdf"&gt;label approved for Arnica 30C pills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
The approved label says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;ACTIVE INGREDIENT&lt;br&gt;
      Each pill contains 30C Arnica Montana&lt;br&gt;
      Also contains: lactose and sucrose&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
      The MHRA must decide whether or not it believes Avogadro‘s number or not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      How many people in the general public realise the ―Each pill contains 30C Arnica Montana‖ means that the ―pills contain no Arnica whatsoever‖? The very mention of the words ―active ingredient‖ will suggest to most people that there is an active ingredient when there is not. This wording alone is both dishonest and deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;     The rest of the approved label consists largely of make-believe too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you are pregnant or breastfeeding consult your doctor before use&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What is your doctor meant to advise you about the dangers of taking a few mg of sugar when you are pregnant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &amp;quot;If you take too much of the product (overdose) speak to a doctor / pharmacist and take this label with you,.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the MHRA has disavowed Avogadro‘s number, an overdose is impossible. To allow a label like this makes the MHRA a laughing stock &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.dcscience.net/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=category&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels should tell the truth in plain language. For example they should say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
         &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product contains no Arnica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that it works for any condition, other than as a placebo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some comments on regulation of magic medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments like to regulate things. They should have regulated the banks a bit more. The problem arises when you try to regulate things that are myths. Like homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Lewis has recently written a superb account of the problems on his Quackometer blog, &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/01/when-the-regulator-believes-in-fairies-who-protects-the-public.html"&gt;When the Regulator Believes in Fairies, Who Protects the Public?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government appears to believe that &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; will solve all the problems. Training people to believe things that aren’t true can never solve problems. On the contrary, it creates problems. Organisations like the Complementary and Natural Health Care Council (CNHC)do nothing to protect the public, They endanger the public (see &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311"&gt;Why the CNHC can’t succeed&lt;/a&gt;). Their excuse for rejecting complaints that members were making false claims was not to deny that the claims were false, but to say that it didn’t matter because that is what they had been trained to say. That is make-believe regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.This is &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/02/dispensing-with-homeopathy-proposal.html"&gt;Andy Lewis’s version&lt;/a&gt; of an honest label. It looks quite accurate to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27 January 2011&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News today makes one despair of the morality of governments. Remember those obviously fraudulent bomb detectors, no more than a dowsing rod? Although they are now the subject of a fraud investigation,  &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9377875.stm"&gt;they are still being sold&lt;/a&gt;. The government has banned their export to Iraq and Afghanistan, but NOT to anywhere else, This suggests not only that the government is (or at least was) quite happy to believe in dowsing. It also implies that even when they realise that it’s fraud they take the view that that business is far more important than even the most basic morality. No doubt they will allow fraudulent labelling of medicines in order to protect the homeopathic industry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does politics have to be quite so disgusting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28 January 2011&lt;/strong&gt;. An excellent post on a similar topic is that referred to in &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4011&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-9196"&gt;a comment&lt;/a&gt; below.  &lt;a href="http://www.ministryoftruth.me.uk/2011/01/27/the-mhra-and-the-non-regulation-of-homeopathy/"&gt;The MHRA and the non-regulation of homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; explains the European background better that I have done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="jcm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, President Obama wants us to recreate the same sense of urgency, and the same national unity, but without the same fear of another competitor country, unless that country is supposed to be China—which, the President noted, recently “became the home to the world’s largest private solar research facility, and the world’s fastest computer.” Okay, that’s something of a spur…but it is not, historically speaking, a Sputnik. (And, making China into the enemy is a very problematic notion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama wasn’t even speaking in a national security frame last night when he invoked Sputnik. He was speaking in an economic one. The sense of shared threat was displaced from an external other to our own economic problems—joblessness and deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the real trick: Is the yearning for national unity, in the wake of Tucson, enough to overcome this chief non-parallel in Obama’s Sputnik analogy? Because undoubtedly, investing in more clean energy research, and more research in general, will spur jobs and innovation. But will we remember to forget our differences in the meantime? Is there some glue that will hold us together? Given the way politics now operate in the U.S., it’s hard to be so optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neuroprosthetics is an area of neuroscience that uses artificial microdevices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems or sensory organs. Different biomedical devices implanted in the central nervous system, so-called neural interfaces, already have been developed to control motor disorders or to translate willful brain processes into specific actions by the control of external devices. One are that has been quite challenging is the communication between biological tissues and artificial sensors - something that is key in building artificial retinas, for instance. Researchers in Italy have now reported the functional interfacing of an organic semiconductor with a network of cultured primary neurons....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

But in preparing for the event, I saw some coverage of a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMFQUFCDaEg"&gt;recent speech in Iowa&lt;/a&gt; where Rep. Michele Bachmann said something that made me wonder about the meaning and rhetorical use of the word "generations", and about her particular choice of the phrase "21 generations" to describe the historical span of American ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Because it's a single question now&lt;br&gt;
that hangs over our country&lt;br&gt;
and it's a question that Abraham Lincoln raised&lt;br&gt;
one hundred fifty years ago almost to this very night&lt;br&gt;
when Abraham Lincoln asked if the liberties of our country would be preserved&lt;br&gt;
until the latest generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a bit later, she added that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;For twenty one generations in America&lt;br&gt;
we've listened to Lincoln's words&lt;br&gt;
we have faithfully performed to the next generation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not very good at mental arithmetic, so by the time I figured out that 21 generations in 150 years works out to a bit more than 7 years per generation, I'd lost the thread of Rep. Bachmann's speech. Tuning in again, I heard something about the 234 years since the Declaration of Independence  in 1776; but 21 generations in 234 years, I calculated, is only about 11  years per generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Ms. Bachmann was saying something about the Mayflower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;They all bound themselves back&lt;br&gt;
to this tradition, this covenant&lt;br&gt;
that was contained in the Mayflower Compact&lt;br&gt;
this covenant that we re-published in the Declaration of Independence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayflower Compact happened in 1620, which was 390 years ago. So I recalculated, and determined that 390/21 is a bit less than 19 years per generation. 19 is better than 7 or 11, but it still seemed a bit short to me. And most of those generations, whatever their length, certainly didn't "listen to Lincoln's words", though maybe that part was sort of figurative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I went off to read the Mayflower Compact, and then I came back to Rep. Bachmann making it clear that she really did mean "twenty one":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;It's been twenty one generations&lt;br&gt;
that America has survived.&lt;br&gt;
For twenty one nations&lt;br&gt;
we've passed the torch of liberty&lt;br&gt;
from one generation successfully to the next.&lt;br&gt;
And the question we need to ask ourselves tonight is this:&lt;br&gt;
Will it end with us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that I was asking myself, though, was "why *21* generations"? Why not 20, or 22, or 11, or whatever? Is there some traditional or numerological reason? And when did these 21 generations start, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that my purpose here is not to pick nits or to poke fun at Rep. Bachmann.  The "21 generations" theme was clearly an central part of what sounded like a stump speech. She used the phrase as though she could assume that her listeners would know what she meant, and perhaps would even find the phrase familiar. But it's new to me, and a quick web search didn't identify for me any tradition of counting generations in American history that would give us 21 of them from some important reference date up to the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor did I discover any obviously-relevant biblical reference.  I turned up J. Schwartz, "&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HvYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA437#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;A Newly Discovered Key to Biblical Chronology&lt;/a&gt;", Biblioteca Sacra 1888, which promotes a numerology in which 21 features prominently:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Bachmann1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this seems to be far from the usual interpretation — Schwartz needs to argue that St. Matthew&amp;#39;s tally was sadly mistaken, for example. And Schwartz&amp;#39;s numerology does not seem to have been widely adopted in the many other discussions of the question of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=bible+generations&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;Biblical generations&lt;/a&gt;. In one more recent &lt;a href="http://www.thercg.org/questions/p199.a.html#c"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The  New Testament opens with the genealogy from Abraham to Jesus Christ. At  the conclusion of this genealogy, Matthew 1:17 states, “So all the  generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David  until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the  captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.” These  three groupings are all considered fourteen generations. When looking at  the average generation for each group, we find that the generation  length differs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;The  average generation from Abraham to David (Matt. 1:17) was approximately  64 years, while the average generation for the other two groups was 38  years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to more secular authorities, the American Heritage Dictionary's sense 2 for &lt;em&gt;generation&lt;/em&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;the term of years, roughly 30 among human beings, accepted as the average period between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED's sense 5.b.:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The average time it takes for children to grow up, become adults, and have children of their own, generally considered to be about thirty years, and used as a rough measure of historical time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encarta's sense 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;time taken to produce new generation: the period of time that it takes for people, animals, or plants to grow up and produce their own offspring, in humans held to be between 30 and 35 years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a generation is 30 years, then 21 of them is 630 years, and 630 years ago was 1380.  This is too late for Leif Eriksson and too early for Christopher Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — in the comments, Adrian Bailey points us to Don Devine, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/learn/library/article.aspx?article=11152"&gt;How Long Is a Generation? Science Provides an Answer&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Ancestry Magazine&lt;/em&gt; 2005, which quotes a study among the !Kung finding "a mean of 25.5 years per female generation [and] a male generational interval of 31 to 38 years"; another study done in Quebec which "determined that male generations averaged 35.0 years while female generations averaged 28.7 years"; and a study in Iceland that found "a female line interval of 28.12 years for the most recent generations and 28.72 years for the whole lineage length", and male generational intervals of "31.13 years for the recent generations and 31.93 years overall". So 30 years is a pretty reasonable overall average.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in sum, what did Rep. Bachmann mean by 21 generations? Did she perhaps divide the 390 years since the Mayflower by 18, getting 21.67 and rounding down to 21? Wherever the "21 generations" theme comes from, is it her own idea, or did she get it from some independent historical or political or religious tradition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — The links and quotes served up by &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2926#comment-105505"&gt;fev&lt;/a&gt; suggest that I was too quick to dismiss Mr. Schwartz's reasoning as atypical, and that multiples of 7 generations, and 3*7=21 generations in particular, do pervade the numerology of eschatological speculation. And Ian Preston has found &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2926#comment-105404"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2926#comment-105422"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that for many people such phrases apparently do evoke (as Ben Hemmens &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2926#comment-105472"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;) the idea that &amp;quot;the coming of Obama(care) … can be cast as a great abomination foretold by the prophets&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1296042643191"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=32970">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c425f3194b23378c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Atheists of Florida Kicked Out of Cape Coral City Council Meeting</title><published>2011-01-26T11:00:49Z</published><updated>2011-01-26T11:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/26/atheists-of-florida-kicked-out-of-cape-coral-city-council-meeting/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month ago, the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/12/17/florida-atheists-told-to-change-shirts-or-leave-city-council-meeting/"&gt;Atheists of Florida were threatened&lt;/a&gt; by the Cape Coral City Council because they were wearing shirts that read, “One Nation, Indivisible”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://free2think.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;amp;t=1320"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://i56.photobucket.com/albums/g183/Vietnamvet-BRIGHT/11-29-103.jpg" width="479" height="359"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happened last time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;During the mid-meeting break, Cape Coral Mayor, John Sullivan, and city manager, Gary King, reiterated their demands for members to replace or cover up the shirts.&lt;/strong&gt; King indicated that the shirts were in violation of council policy. He further warned that if the shirts were still visible, anyone wearing the attire would be asked to leave and if necessary, Cape Coral police would be employed to enforce the demand. [AoF president John] Kieffer asked to see the policy and was told that this could not be done at the time. Kieffer responded that he would refuse to comply and would accept the consequences. &lt;strong&gt;A few minutes later, King informed Kieffer that he believed that the shirts “should be okay.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday night, the city council followed through with their threat when AoF President &lt;strong&gt;John Kieffer&lt;/strong&gt; got up to speak.  Mayor &lt;strong&gt;John Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.news-press.com/article/20110125/NEWS0101/101250355/1003/ACC/Atheist-leader-ousted-from-Cape-council-s-meeting"&gt;kicked him out because of his “improper attire.”&lt;/a&gt;  Soon after, the council voted to let the atheists speak (or, really, to avoid any potential lawsuits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s all on video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mayor’s also upset because the atheists shouted “Indivisible” during the Pledge of Allegiance when they were expected to say “under god.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen Hancock&lt;/strong&gt; at the Examiner &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/humanism-freethought-in-tampa-bay/cape-coral-ejects-atheist-for-wearing-t-shirt"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Cape Coral City Council and the mayor have yet to clarify their apparently nonexistent dress code policy and the mayor seems to think he has the right to arbitrarily decide who can address the council and who can’t. Some members of the council also apparently think that they have the right to force Atheists to invoke God in the pledge despite the fact that the First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits the government from coercing people into participating in a religious practice they don’t agree with.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atheists aren’t asking the council to promote godlessness.  They’re asking for the meetings to be kept secular.  There’s no need to invoke god’s name in the Pledge — or say it at all.  Ditto with any invocation prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an easy fix, and it just so happens to be the Constitutional thing to do.  This controversy wouldn’t exist if the council simply focused on city issues instead of on promoting faith in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kitteh is in fact a neighbor’s kitteh and not my own (my kitteh, Clio, is in Arizona taking care of my mom since her liver transplant).  I don’t know his name, and he doesn’t allow me to get close to him, but we have a nodding acquaintance.  I see him nearly every day when I put the futons out to air.  He’s usually draped across the roof of another neighbor’s silver sports car, languidly sunning himself in luxurious tranquility.  On this particular day, as I was returning from a morning walk, I looked up and was surprised to see him perched on the roof—hardly a comfortable posture.  I watched for several minutes, but he never moved or blinked.  I could only assume, given his expression, that he had repented of his luxurious lifestyle and was doing his early morning Zazen on the ridgepole as penance for his sins.   Caption:  “I can haz Buddah Nacherz”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fallibility of eye-witness memory is well documented. But what about people&amp;#39;s memories of their own past intentions? This is an unexplored issue in memory research with real-life implications.

Consider the copyright infringement case in 2002, in which French composer Jacques Loussier sued Eminem, claiming that the track Kill You sampled beats from Loussier&amp;#39;s work. Loussier further claimed that the success of the album was due in large part to the popularity of that specific track. Eminem&amp;#39;s team responded by conducting a survey of people who&amp;#39;d bought the album in the last three years, only one per cent of whom stated they&amp;#39;d bought the album for the specific song Kill You.

The survey appeared to undermine Loussier&amp;#39;s claim, but the trouble is that without any research on the topic, we don&amp;#39;t know whether those survey responses can be trusted. Now a team led by Suzanne Kaasa and including Elizabeth Loftus has made a start on plugging this gap in the literature. 

Nearly six hundred undergrads answered open-ended questions about why they&amp;#39;d purchased, downloaded or copied their most recently acquired album (the vast majority had acquired one within the last two weeks), and then they provided the same information again six months to a year later. The participants&amp;#39; answers fell into five main categories: because they liked the artist, liked the music, liked a specific song or songs, someone had recommended the album, or they needed the album for a specific purpose.

The key finding was that only one in five participants gave a consistent reason or reasons at both time points. The researchers had anticipated that memory for some reasons might prove more durable over time than others, but this wasn&amp;#39;t the case. Overall, the most common form of change was simply to invent new reasons at the later time point. Sometimes participants also forgot reasons they&amp;#39;d mentioned earlier. Unsurprisingly perhaps, participants who recalled more reasons at the first time point tended to be more prone to forgetting reasons when quizzed again later. This was also true of participants who reported liking their CD more, perhaps because they&amp;#39;d felt less need to dwell on their motives at the time they acquired the album. 

A subset of 82 of the participants also gave their reasons at a third time point, approximately six months to a year after the second time of questioning. Although still evident, changes in memory between the second and third time points were far reduced compared with between the first and second time points. This is important for real-life legal situations because consistency of answers across later interviews could be interpreted as a sign of memory reliability. &amp;#39;It appears critical to have an accurate and complete record of the very first interview given by a witness,&amp;#39; the researchers said. 

The study had some limitations, including the fact that the precise time between album acquisition and the first questioning session was unknown. However, the researchers observed that &amp;#39;although individuals may not be able to accurately recall the reasons for their behaviours ... the real world continues to rely on self-reported motivations in a variety of circumstances, including police investigations and court proceedings.&amp;#39;

Handley is a libelous douchebag</title><published>2011-01-26T08:11:24Z</published><updated>2011-01-26T08:11:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/j-b-handley-is-a-libelous-douchebag/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="width:258px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/art/handleyp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/art/handleyp.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="139"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord of the Douchebags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question regarding the vaccine-autism hypothesis has been asked and answered; vaccines don’t cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start my post by reiterating this fact not because it bares repeating (because again, it’s a fact), but because that walking advertisement for abortion named J.B. Handley insists that that sentence drives him nuts (funny because it implies he isn’t already nuts, but I probably shouldn’t say that as it might hurt a future libel case against him). And people as despicable as J.B. Handley ought to be unhappy as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/01/dissecting-the-autism-science-foundations-use-of-the-hungry-lie.html"&gt;Handley has just posted another piece of propagandist garbage&lt;/a&gt; over at the official home of propagandist garbage, Age of Autism. He begins by announcing that he’s going to teach his readers a little “Science 101″, ironic as he’s not a professional scientist, is by all measurable standards scientifically illiterate, and because every single reputable health organization on Earth completely disagrees with his now utterly discredited scientific beliefs, based largely on research that has proven both erroneous and fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handley’s attempt to get around this fact is to make an argument from authority, cherry-picking the small number of fringe individuals who agree with him, who happen to have the title of “doctor”, and who don’t have any professional background in a related field or relevant research published in a reputable journal. For instance, in this article, he cites Bernadine Healey, a cardiologist. Last I checked, neither vaccines nor autism were related to matters of the heart. But of course anti-vaxxers will point out that she was the former head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Of course&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2008/05/the-bernadine-healy-card/"&gt; she also has a history of going against the scientific process and being wrong&lt;/a&gt;. She’s demonstrated a willingness to put politics ahead of her scientific credibility.  After being appointed head of the NIH, scientists started leaving in record numbers because of the politicization of scientific agendas such as the ban on  fetal-tissue research because the Republican administration believed it  encouraged abortion. She even lobbied against overturning the Bush Administration’s ban on fetal tissue research, despite her previous support of it. There were charges of her mishandling a scientific misconduct case. And of course she was also a member of The Advancement of Sound Science Center (TASSC):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advancement of Sound Science Center (TASSC), formerly the  Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, is an industry-funded lobby  group which promotes the idea that environmental science on issues  including smoking, pesticides and global warming is “junk science”,  which should be replaced by “sound science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the primary focus of TASSC was an  attempt to discredit research on Environmental Tobacco Smoke [passive  smoking] as a long-term cause of increased cancer and heart problem  rates in the community—especially among office workers and children  living with smoking parents. It subsequently advanced industry-friendly  positions on a wide range of topics, including global warming, smoking,  phthalates, and pesticides. Later still, they extended the role of TASSC to Europe using Dr George Carlo. TASSC used the label of ‘junk science’ to criticise work that was unfavorable to the interests of its backers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s quite ironic then that the anti-vaccine movement so frequently accuses their scientific critics of being like the scientists who were infamously in the employ of Big Tobacco in order to promote the tobacco industry’s propaganda while they happily cite the claims of so-called doctors who were in fact lobbyists paid to deny the environmental impact…of smoking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just let that one sink in for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the great doctor who J.B. Handley has decided knows better about vaccines and autism than every reputable health organization on Earth, a doctor who lobbied for the tobacco industry. And though I shouldn’t even have to point this out, what medical education does Handley have that equips him with the skills necessary to distinguish good science from bad? The answer of course is none. He’s got no greater expertise to make that call than I do. But whereas I recognize how the scientific process is designed to weed out false conclusions and I am humble enough to stand behind the conclusions of people with decades of professional experience who have earned great reputations for their work, Handley arrogantly believes he knows better than everyone and simply endorses anybody who happens to reinforce his bias…even if they were once paid by the tobacco industry to deny the environmental dangers of tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Handley straight out libels Alison Singer of the Autism Science Foundation (ASF) and Dr. Paul Offit, singling them out as “liars” who feed “the hungry lie” as he calls it. Funny how at no point does he reference the fact that every reputable health organization on Earth holds the exact same position as them and so he is implicitly calling them all liars. He calls the ASF, “Alison Singer’s basement-dwelling autism organization” as he always does as if this is claim alone somehow discredits the facts she presents. It doesn’t. It’s just a classic J.B. Handley attempt to poison the well. He also claims Alison Singer was “fired” from Autism Speaks though I can find no record of anyone affiliated with Autism Speaks verifying that claim. And since only Singer’s ideological critics over at Age of Autism seem to be making such a claim, I’m inclined to write it off Handley and Age of Autism’s “hungry lie” that purely comes from their constantly operating propaganda spin machine. But if I’m wrong and this claim can be traced back to a legitimate source, someone please give me the source and I’ll happily make a correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he finally gets into his Science 101 portion. So he gives an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to figure out if smoking hurts, helps, or kills people, you need a group of people who didn’t smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you just ask your friend, Ms. Healey who will probably tell you smoking doesn’t hurt people at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, here’s my first giant point:&lt;em&gt;Without a real control group, the conclusions of a study on the potential harm of a drug are 100% useless&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we all just agree on that? If you have a study, and everyone either  gets a whole pill or a half a pill, do you have a control group to  compare the outcome to? Of course you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, studies generally require a control group of some form but I can tell already that he’s about to use control group and double-blind synonymously as there are no shortage of studies with control groups that disprove Handley’s beliefs while there aren’t any double-blind studies, usually the gold standard, for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question #1: Can vaccines harm some people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the answer is “yes” and I’m sure some of you will want to  qualify this answer by saying, “but it’s a really small number of  people.” Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, he HAS been listening after all! It’s miracle that it only took the guy ten years to recognize that medical science isn’t black and white. Of course you got to love that extremely articulate dismissal of the importance of this fact:  “Whatever.” What you and I would consider to be a rather important detail that makes the difference between one person in a million being seriously harmed and many orders of magnitude more than that Handley feels he can flippantly brush off as no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question #2: If one vaccine can harm some people, do you think six vaccines given at the same time will do more or less harm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error. Not enough data. It’s not the number of vaccines that would make the difference but the amount of antigens and other ingredients in those vaccines. And we happen to know for the fact that the amount of antigens in the vaccines is much less now than it used to be. The immunologic load has dropped from 3000 components in the 7 vaccines used in 1980 to less than 200 in the 14 vaccines recommended today. I know, J.B.. I know. “Whatever.” Who needs actual details when you can flippantly brush aside any inconvenient facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, fine, I stacked the decks a bit on #2, but this is a point lost  on many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s lost on people who actually care about the truth and child safety more than ill-conceived ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s exceptionally likely that if one vaccine can cause some  harm, six vaccines will cause more harm to more people, the question is  if that harm is exponentially or geometrically greater, and it’s perhaps  the most important question of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, weren’t you paying attention. The question is what is the immunologic load in the vaccines. That’s the most relevant and important question here. The first rule of toxicology is that dosage makes the poison. How many times do we have to explain this to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question #3: Do we know the health outcome of children who receive the  US vaccine schedule compared to a group of children who don’t? Said  differently, do we have unvaccinated controls anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, actually that’s two questions. Can’t you even count?! But as J.B. would say with the maturity of the characters in &lt;em&gt;Clueless&lt;/em&gt;, “whatever.” To answer the first question 3, yes, we do. And to answer the second question 3, yes, we do. From Steven B. Harris, MD:  in Japan—300,000 people simply stopped vaccinating with MMR until by 1993 they’d stopped vaccinating entirely. Not only did the rate of autism in the completely unvaccinated children fail to decline but it actually went up. Further, we compared vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in Denmark and found no distinction in autism rates. We also know autism is four times more prevalent in boys than girls despite both receiving the same vaccines on the same schedule. If one identical twin has autism, the other twin has an 90% chance of also being autistic, regardless of vaccination. Fraternal twins or siblings of individuals with autism have a 50% chance of also being autistic, regardless of vaccination. New Jersey has the sixth lowest vaccination in the U.S. but is number one in autism. And ever since we dropped thimerosal from most child vaccines, autism rates have seemed to increase. By every reasonable standard we can think of, we can find no relationship between vaccines and autism. If anything, our studies show vaccines may decrease the autism rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we AoA readers all know the answer here: a blazing NO, which  makes those who repeat the hungry lie, like Alison Singer and Paul  Offit, blazing liars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha! That’s because Age of Autism readers are being systematically lied to by folks like J.B. here. That’s like basing your ideas of reality on what Fox News viewers think. And the “hungry lie” to borrow Handley’s silly phrase, is that the kind of studies he and his ilk demand &lt;a href="http://www.vaccinetimes.com/the-no-vaccinated-vs-unnvaccinated-study-gambit/"&gt;are unsafe and unreasonable&lt;/a&gt; as they’d literally endanger the lives of thousands of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Feigned exasperation” is the latest strategy from those feeding the hungry lie…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And earlier in his article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lie, it really drives me nuts. More, and I can say this and mean it, anyone who repeats this lie is immediately my enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the irony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- None of the studies compare anything but vaccinated children to other vaccinated children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False. I refer you again to those 300,000 unvaccinated Japanese and the Danish study as the two most famous examples. You know the Danish study, J.B. That’s the one you dismiss out of hand because one of its minor contributors happened to commit a crime that that is completely unrelated to the study itself. And they say McCarthyism is dead! And again, I refer you to&lt;a href="http://www.vaccinetimes.com/the-no-vaccinated-vs-unnvaccinated-study-gambit"&gt; this article by Leart Shaka&lt;/a&gt; that directly addresses your pathetic argument as well as your very next argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 36 vaccines US children receive, only 2 of those shots (the MMR  given twice) have ever been compared for their relationship to autism,  and then only with otherwise vaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First it was the MMR. So we studied it and found no link. So then you moved on to the thimerosal and we found no link there either. So then you just made up another vaccine-related hypothesis, and another, and another. The one thing that is consistent here is that it’s always about the vaccines even though no credible evidence suggests they have anything to do with autism.This is just a constant game of move the goalpost. We can never exhaust every possible combination of vaccines and vaccine schedules to satisfy the anti-vaccine movement. It’s just perpetual wack-a-mole when our resources would be better spent exploring real leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote &lt;a href="http://www.vaccinetimes.com/the-no-vaccinated-vs-unnvaccinated-study-gambit"&gt;Shaka&lt;/a&gt; in the article I just linked to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of tactic is similar to going up to a detective investigating a  murder case and saying “I think you should conduct a search of that  vehicle there” and if he agrees and nothing is found, you go back to him  and say “OK, but did you search….that vehicle over there” and so on and  so on, pointing to vehicles just because you think there may be  something there. How seriously do you think you’d be taken by the  detective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to Captain Crankypants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s absurd, really, how little work has actually been done, despite the feigned exasperation that’s oft-repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, autism research is arguably the health issue being studied the most right now. Handley, I should point out, isn’t doing any of that research. He’s just sitting on the sidelines complaining that it isn’t moving fast enough for him. Well sorry J.B. but science is a lot of hard work. It isn’t like dusting crops. It’s a trial and error process where scientists are mostly flying blind. We’ve been researching cancer a lot longer than autism and we still haven’t unlocked all the mysteries behind what causes all cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, really, please, do not take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, don’t take his word for it. That’s the only thing Handley has said so far that I completely 100% agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to now waste my time, and plenty of yours…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s what you’ve been doing all along, wasting other people’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;nd go through every single study, in the order presented, that sits on  the Autism Science Foundation’s site, and let you be the judge. Please,  if you are a doctor or a scientist, please comment, feel free to argue  and prove me wrong. Please, I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, he doesn’t. What he means is that he’s going to editorialize as he pretends to objectively go through the studies that disprove his ideology and that every reputable health organization on Earth finds persuasive, and then he’ll demand that you reach the conclusions he’s attempting to impose on you while offering empty platitudes about not wanting you to just take his word for it, but if you then do disagree with him, he’ll do what he does with all his critics, accuse you of being a pharma shill, a liar, a baby-eating cannibal, and/or a whore who delivers oral sex to Dr. Paul Offit –all of these accusations have in fact been made or at least implicitly endorsed by Handley himself against various critics in the recent past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much as it pains me, I’m going to comment on each of the 20 studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, despite his claim that he’s going to waste his time (and apparently thinks educating others with his version of reality is wasting your–another thing I agree with though it’s odd for him to suggest that educating the public, what he claims to be doing, would be a waste of their time)–despite his claim that he’s going to waste his time commenting on every study, he’s really just recycling the already debunked pseudo-refutations he’s had up for years at his fourteenstudies website, a website so old that it was named fourteen when now the studies directly refuting the anti-vaccine claims is twenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if Handley isn’t really going to waste any of his time copy and pasting his old, debunked pseudo-refutations, I’m not going to waste my time refuting them when various science bloggers have already done so for most of those studies &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451#more-451"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=459#more-459"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=466#more-466"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/09/safeminds_swings_at_price_et_al_and_miss.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6852"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And you can find responses to JB Handley’s response to one of those refutations &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523#more-523"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But again, one thing Handley suggests that I agree with is don’t take his word for it. If you find any of his claims really compelling, contact Handley’s critics among the scientific community and ask them for a rebuttal to his claims. I’m sure Paul Offit would be happy to take a few minutes of his time educating an inquiring mind. And Steven Novella and David Gorski would definitely not mind taking the time to answer the criticisms. Someone makes a claim? Check the response from the other side. Then go back to the first party and get the rebuttal to that. Then go back to second party and get a rebuttal to that. Back and forth. That’s REAL research. Don’t take people on one side of an alleged controversy at their word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Handley don’t really expect you to read everything he wrote critically. He apparently thinks no more highly of the intellect of his readers as I do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank the AoA readers who made it this far, all three of you.&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/wp-admin/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, he’s just drowning his mostly scientifically illiterate readers in what superficially seems like in depth scientific criticism but doesn’t actually either expect them to understand any of it or expert them to show the commitment to even read it all. But hey, it’s long and he says he’s debunking all these twenty studies that every reputable health organization on Earth finds compelling…so that’s good enough, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and then he lists his key points from the article, saying these points are things his readers “know for sure.” What happened to, “don’t take my word for it”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he invites his critics to respond:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haters, feel free to chime in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…which is hilarious because Age of Autism is notorious for censoring all comments critical to their claims. And in fact, not a single critical comment can be found in that article, which is rather extraordinary when you consider the fact that every article addressing this issue on independent sites have no shortage of debating on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what can you expect from a guy who posts as his actual scientific credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.B. Handley is the father of a child with autism, the co-founder of Generation Rescue, and a contributing writer for AoA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even I have a better bio line on my Examiner page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So despite the dishonest  invite,  since I can’t comment on Handley’s piece on his page, I’d appreciate if someone could pass a message along for me. You tell that slimy piece of worm-ridden filth to go fuck himself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite is Beim Schlafengehen  (“On going to sleep”), clearly about death.  And the best version, by far, is by soprano Jessye Norman.  Her voice is almost inhumanly powerful, and the song ineffably beautiful.  The crescendo, at 3:10, and the ending, always make me tear up.  If you don’t like this, you don’t have ears to hear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was just listening to the president&amp;#39;s state of the union address, and getting very annoyed at all the obnoxious lip service paid to bipartisanship…when the Republicans have put up this moron to argue against Obama after his speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the Republican representative. She's the official &lt;i&gt;Tea Party&lt;/i&gt; representative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? Since when did the Tea Party acquire the credibility to share equal time with Republicans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, well…here&amp;#39;s more schadenfreude for you. Watch Sal Russo, some teabagger bigwig, get ripped apart over Bachmann&amp;#39;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if you remember, but I mentioned a few years ago how Vladimir Nabokov, best known as a novelist, was also a self-taught expert on butterflies. In 1945 he had a wild idea about how his favorite group of butterflies evolved that no one took seriously. Well, for the past decade I and my colleagues have been scouring the Andes for butterflies and sequencing their DNA to test his hypothesis. And he turns out to have been right in all sorts of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, and the paper will be published tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is for Jack and Milton. The stairs are in Odenplan, Stockholm.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a set of stairs, with a moving escalator next to it …. both of which lead to the same spot on the floor of the upper level. At first no one took the stairs, almost 97% of the people took the escalator. Okay. I think that could be a normal expected result. Then a group of engineers got together, and decided they wanted to change the percentage around. Notice what these scientists did. Clever huh. And now they have reversed the percentages, as a whopping 66% more people take the stairs, than ride the escalator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So, just to fill you in, the 26th of January is Australia Day and it commemorates the landing of our first fleet in 1788 and the planting of the British flag in what was then known as New Holland and is now known as Sydney Cove, New South Wales, Australia. Most people celebrate the day with a public holiday, a beer or two, a barbi and the TripleJ Hottest 100.

We will get back to the Australiana theme in a moment but I want to take it down a notch first by talking about Hepatitis B virus.

Hepatitis diseases are not limited to those induce by viruses. In fact hepatitis just means inflammation of the liver from hepat(o)- for liver and –it is meaning inflammation of. This has led to the common misconception that the Hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E) are related to each other, they’re not, but they do all cause liver inflammation. In fact according to the Balitmore Classification of viruses they fall in completely different families. Furthermore the run of letters, which also suggest relatedness, simply describe the order in which the viruses were identified.

   The Baltimore Classification describes the lifecycle of all viruses based on their genome structure. Protein is produced based on the mRNA sequence so that’s why all lines flow back to mRNA.

While all are problematic in their own way for this post we are interested only in Hepatitis B virus (HBV), arguably the biggest problem in the (not) family of hepatitis inducing viruses.

How big a problem is HBV? Well, approximately 2 billion people worldwide are infected, greater than 350 million people are in the chronic phase of infection and its estimated that a quarter of these people will die of liver cancer or other complications directly caused by HBV.

Like many viruses encased in a membrane (a so called enveloped virus), HBV requires body liquid exchanges to transmit from person to person but is not necessarily picky as to which liquid and transmission has been observed by blood exchange, sexual contact and even maternal-foetal exchange across the placenta. 

HBV disease is very well characterised and follows a fairly generalised route. Following transmission the viruses work their way into the blood stream and eventually find their way into the liver where they can attach and enter liver cells. Once inside the cells the virus and its components are very stable and viral replication kicks in resulting in huge numbers of virus being produced and seeking out new liver cells. This infection stage can last up to 6 months with almost no symptoms beyond generalised flu-like symptoms or a touch of jaundice.

Following initial viral replication there are three outcomes are possible. Best case scenario, you mount an early, strong and effective immune response that removes all the virus from your system. Worst case scenario #1 (short term), you develop a form of acute hepatitis called fulminant hepatitis which is caused by your immune system reacting too strongly and liquifiying your liver in an attempt to remove the virus resulting in a quick death. Worst case scenario #2 (long term), your immune response is slow or weak and the virus persists resulting in a chronic infection. An interesting little side note here is that if you are a child your chances of developing chronic hepatitis B skyrocket to 95% compared to the 5% chance to adults and at this stage we really don’t understand why.

So your either fine, dead or a time bomb and chronic sufferers can look forward to a life of medications attempting to prevent death. Having said that some chronic HBV patients go on and live lives free of complication or further symptoms but most end up with either a passive or active form of liver destruction depending on whether you show any symptoms or not respectively.

The destruction of the liver is immune mediated which mean the virus doesn’t actually kill liver cells but its presence activates the immune system inducing it to kill any cell with virus. As the liver can regrow your left with constant cell death and constant cell renewal but it all comes at a cost, scars. Scars in tissues are called scar tissue (duh) or more accurately fibroma. Fibromas are a problem as they impair organ function and when you develop too many the organ starts to die as blood cannot flow to all parts of the liver or promotes the liver to overcompensate and regenerate faster leading to cancer – hepatocellular carcinoma.

So what can we do about HBV? Currently your best option is vaccination. Its pretty cheap (for me it was any way), very safe and really effective. As well as being the best option, its kind of the only option as all the anti-viral drugs currently available do not ‘cure’ the virus, they can only act to freeze or pause it. When you stop the drugs the virus un-pauses. As I will most definitely talk about at a later date vaccines are...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The premise: That the mass media associates sea level rise with climate change and reports on it frequently, yet the scientific community remains dubious of the media&amp;#39;s accuracy. So how god or bad is the situation really? The authors examined the accuracy of reporting between 1989 and 2009 by seven prominent US and UK newspapers:New York TimesWashington PostLos Angeles TimesFinancial TimesThe Times (London)The Guardian The Telegraph(Credit: NASA)Their findings—a surprise to me and I suspect to the authors too—that journalists have done an excellent job portraying scientiﬁc research on sea level rise projections to 2100. So why the unease? Well it turns out that while coverage of the issue  of sea level rise has risen in the past 20 years, it&amp;#39;s done so in fits  and starts pegged to major news cycles—the release of an IPCC  report, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the 2009 COP-15.(Credit: Environmental Research Letters DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/6/1/014004) There&amp;#39;s been little to no coverage of direct research, the completion of  speciﬁc projections, or the publication of incremental but important  papers. For those milestones, the mass media is largely  silent. Obviously this speaks to the different tool sets of media and science—media being the microphone, science the microscope. If we can ever get them working together, we&amp;#39;ll get real traction in the flood.(Credit: Wikimedia Commons.)The authors conclude:Mass media presentations of climate change remain key inﬂuences that bound discourses and shape the spectrum of possibility for climate mitigation and adaptation actions. Amid much recent criticism of climate science and the media on the high-stakes, high proﬁle and highly politicized issue, accurate reporting on projections for sea level rise by 2100 demonstrates a bright spot at the interface of climate science and mass media. These ﬁndings can contribute to more measured considerations of climate impacts and policy action in the public sphere.The paper: Rick, U., Boykoff, M., &amp;amp; Pielke Jr, R. (2011).

&lt;p&gt;The Quiverfull movement believes in nonstop procreation as long as the married Christian couple can make it happen (e.g. The Duggars).  They also believe in a patriarchy, very formal courtship, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vyckie Garrison&lt;/strong&gt; birthed seven children before leaving the movement for good. She now writes at the blog &lt;a href="http://nolongerquivering.com/"&gt;No Longer Quivering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Mullen&lt;/strong&gt; and the folks at the &lt;a href="http://foundationbeyondbelief.org/fbbpodcast/"&gt;Parenting Within Reason podcast&lt;/a&gt; interviewed Vyckie about her current and former life — it’s a really eye-opening (ear-popping?) interview that’s worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more of &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedparenting.com/2011/01/22/my-fascination-with-the-duggars-and-quiverful/"&gt;Julie’s thoughts on the interview here&lt;/a&gt;.  The most striking part concerns the Quiverfull idea that it’s ok to basically cause physical harm to your child if they don’t follow your commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The idea here is that by teaching your child to obey you rather than follow his own natural inclinations, you will instill enough obedience for the child to forego his sinful nature.  Obedience is the most important trait according to this thought process.  If you can’t obey your parents, you won’t obey God, and you’ll end up in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vyckie says she did not practice this particular form of discipline with her kids, but she did emphasize obedience as the highest virtue, and she tells us in the interview how it drained the spirit right out of her children.  &lt;strong&gt;Once liberated from this dogma, the kids began to flourish and grow as individuals.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds to me like the worst possible way to raise a child… kids need to be taught when and how to rebel &lt;em&gt;properly&lt;/em&gt;. Easier said than done, I’m sure, but to tell them they must never question what you say?  What a horrible lesson to teach a child.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik¸ we had no idea how we’d beat them to the moon. The science wasn’t there yet. NASA didn’t even exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after investing in better research and education, we didn’t just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our generation’s Sputnik moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is potentially very powerful stuff. He’s &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/12/06/president-obama-north-carolina-our-generation-s-sputnik-moment-now"&gt;used the analogy before&lt;/a&gt;, but using it the SOTU means a lot more. I’ll be saying more about this tomorrow morning….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Me: So you work in coffee. What do you think of this whole Trenta thing?&lt;br&gt;
Gabe: Honestly, this is about McDonald’s. They are very successful with their iced coffee and Sbucks is trying to compete. […] They have already lost a lot of customers to McDonalds/ McCafe due to quality and price. McDonalds has better coffee.&lt;br&gt;
Me: Whoa, really?&lt;br&gt;
Gabe: Yeah, McDs has won numerous blind tasting competitions and they have cheaper prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that this is an appropriate time to bring back a comment by Stefano Taschini on an earlier LL post about names for coffee sizes ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001677.html"&gt;Latte Lingo: Raising a pint at Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;", 11/30/2004):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;I believe there must have been a small mistype: technically, a warm liquid that you ingest in quantities exceeding half a liter is "stock" not "coffee".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was in reference to the "venti" (591 ml.) size, which is a bit more than an (British Imperial) pint (568 ml.). The trenta will be used only for iced coffee and other cold drinks, and at 916 ml. is almost but not quite a (U.S. Customary) quart (946 ml.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor can I resist reprinting Dave Barry's opinions on names for coffee sizes borrowed from Romance languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;We begin today with a disturbing escalation in the trend of coffee retailers giving stupid names to cup sizes. As you know, this trend began several years ago when Starbucks (motto: "There's one opening right now in your basement") decided to call its cup sizes "Tall" (meaning "not tall," or ''small"), "Grande" (meaning "medium") and "Venti" (meaning, for all we know, "weasel snot"). Unfortunately, we consumers, like moron sheep, started actually USING these names. Why? If Starbucks decided to call its toilets "AquaSwooshies," would we go along with THAT? Yes! Baaa!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Recently, at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Death March, Mister Language Person noticed that a Starbuck&amp;#39;s competitor, Seattle&amp;#39;s Best Coffee (which also uses &amp;quot;Tall&amp;quot; for small and &amp;quot;Grande&amp;quot; for medium) is calling ITS large cup size — get ready — &amp;quot;Grande Supremo.&amp;quot; Yes. And as Mister Language Person watched in horror, many customers — seemingly intelligent, briefcase-toting adults — actually used this term, as in, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll take a Grande Supremo.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Listen, people: You should never, ever have to utter the words "Grande Supremo" unless you are addressing a tribal warlord who is holding you captive and threatening to burn you at the stake. JUST SAY YOU WANT A LARGE COFFEE, PEOPLE. Because if we let the coffee people get away with this, they're not going to stop, and some day, just to get a lousy cup of coffee, you'll hear yourself saying, "I'll have a Mega Grandissimaximo Giganto de Humongo-Rama-Lama-Ding-Dong decaf." And then you will ask for the key to the AquaSwooshie. And when THAT happens, people, the terrorists will have won.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note however that 7-Eleven has long since blazed a trail into the land of extraordinary drink sizes with the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Eleven#The_Big_Gu"&gt;Big Gulp&lt;/a&gt;" series, with a 32-oz. basic "Big Gulp", and other sizes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;20 US fl oz (0.59 l) Gulp&lt;br&gt;
44 US fl oz (1.3 l) or 1.2 l (41 US fl oz) (depending on region) Super Big Gulp&lt;br&gt;
64 US fl oz (1.9 l) Double Gulp&lt;br&gt;
128 US fl oz (3.8 l) Team Gulp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that except for "super" and "double", these are all Anglo-Saxon morphemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find any recent information about McDonald&amp;#39;s range of drink sizes, or their current size nomenclature — thus &lt;a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/full_menu/beverages.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; gives only one size per beverage type. But traditionally, they used &lt;em&gt;small, medium,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt;, with other names like "child" for something smaller than small, and "summer" for something larger than large.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295993807392"><id gr:original-id="http://marcofrasca.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/the-tevatron-affair-and-the-fat-gluon/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1526561650a936fb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The Tevatron affair and the “fat” gluon</title><published>2011-01-25T15:44:54Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T15:44:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/hXmjCJd3ms0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://marcofrasca.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/the-tevatron-affair-and-the-fat-gluon/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Tevatron is again at the forefront of the blogosphere mostly due to Jester and Lubos.

The first direct test of this hypothesis was the experiment that followed on from my learning study, in which we systematically perturbed the various candidate information variables to see which affected performance in the perceptual judgement task.I like this study a lot, if I do say so myself. It&amp;#39;s a serious attempt to make a strong test of the model&amp;#39;s predictions, and we invested a lot of time in the methodology. This is also that rare paper that benefited from a vigorous review process; the end result is, I think, a clear, careful, and detailed presentation of a critical result for the perception-action approach Geoff and I are developing.Readers interested in the issue of how you can scientifically study information from an ecological perspective should certainly read the paper (Ken, that&amp;#39;s you :); it&amp;#39;s my go-to reference for how I believe this has to be done. The main lesson - it&amp;#39;s hard to do this properly, but the rewards, in terms of unambiguous data, are clear.Perturbation Methods You may recall from my discussion of the development of the model that the dynamic characteristics of a rhythmically moving human limb were established via perturbation methods (e.g. Kay et al, 1991). This is a standard technique in dynamical systems for probing the composition and organisation of a given system, i.e. to establish what the components are and how they are arranged with respect to one another.a. Composition The premise of a perturbation study is simple; a given dynamical system will include some components but explicitly not include others (see also Bingham, 1988). If you perturb the value of a component, and the system does not change it&amp;#39;s behaviour, then you have identified a component that is not part of the system at hand. Colour is a good example in human movement; altering the colour of an object rarely, if ever, affects the kinematics of a prehension movement towards that object. Colour is therefore being ignored by the prehension system (even though it may be being detected by the organism as a whole) and your model of prehension should not try to account for its effects.On the other hand, if you perturb a variable&amp;#39;s value and the system does respond, then you have identified something that must be included in your account of the system; in prehension a simple example is an object&amp;#39;s size, which shapes the scaling of the hand&amp;#39;s grip aperture as the reach is being made. Clearly, the prehension system cares about the size of objects and your dynamical systems model should therefore care too.b. OrganisationThe other important issue in dynamical systems is how these components are arranged with respect to one another. For example, Kay et al (1991) perturbed a rhythmically moving arm by abruptly changing it&amp;#39;s motion at various points through the cycle (either speeding it up by pushing in the same direction, or slowing it down by pushing in the opposite direction). The question was, how does the system respond? If the arm returns to it&amp;#39;s cycle at the same place in the cycle (i.e. phase) as it would have been if it had been left alone, this tells us that the arm&amp;#39;s motion is being driven as a function of time. It&amp;#39;s position is forced, and the system is non-autonomous. If, however, the phase is reset after the perturbation so that the arm is now in a different place than it would have been if left alone, this tells us the arm is being driven autonomously, i.e. as a function of it&amp;#39;s own behaviour. The presence or absence of phase resetting is therefore diagnostic about how the components are coupled together.Human rhythmic movement exhibits phase resetting and is thus autonomous, and so any driver must be made from state variables, i.e. variables which describe the behaviour of the oscillator (position, velocity or acceleration). Bingham relied on this work when formulating the model; the phase driven oscillator was therefore constructed to be autonomous (phase is simply a relation between velocity and position, two state variables). There&amp;#39;s more than one way to build an autonomous driver, however, and while implementing perceived phase as the relative direction of motion explains the key phenomena, the evidence supporting this was still circumstantial. This study aimed to rule out the alternatives.The other advantage here is that perturbation methods are effectively &amp;#39;full-cue&amp;#39;. All of these displays showed coordinated rhythmic movements in which a mean relative phase was defined; we simply made different components uninformative about relative phase to see whether this had any effect on perception. Most visual psychophysics studies would have presented the candidate variables (e.g. relative position) in isolation and measured thresholds - but we aren&amp;#39;t interested in these thresholds. What we want to know is what people detect in order to perceive relative phase. Alternative, autonomous drivers1. Relative Position:  the model assumes that relative phase is perceived as itself, via the detection of relative direction; however, it is possible that people perceive each phase separately and then compute the difference. Phase is a position along a spatial-temporal trajectory which lives in a space defined by position and velocity; in order to be able to perceive it, the peak amplitude and peak velocity must be well defined and stable (when you compute it, you must normalise the signal using this data). To perturb the perception of phase, we therefore disrupted this reference frame. On every half cycle, the amplitude (and thus the peak speed) of the dot was altered randomly. This meant that the reference frame from one half cycle was no longer informative about the reference frame for the next half cycle, and thus phase could not be reliably perceived. Relative direction was unaffected by this, and so relative phase was unperturbed. Figure 1. Phase portrait (left) and time series (right) of a display where we perturbed position2. Frequency: The position perturbation affects both the location and magnitude of peak velocity and peak amplitude. To control for this, we next kept amplitude constant and perturbed only the magnitude of peak velocity by changing the frequency over the trial. Figure 2. Phase portrait (left) and time series (right) of a display where we perturbed frequency (we ran this in both directions)3. Relative Speed: The second possible source of information is the relative speed; for a given amplitude, different relative phases do each have a unique relative speed signature. However, it would be trivial to make a display moving at 0° with different amplitudes which recreated the signature of, say, 180°, and it is simply not the case that anyone would mistake the relative phase. The model predicts that speed is not information, but noise on the detection of the information, but we explicitly tested a perturbation of relative speed to rule it out....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It was really exciting, and we had a pretty great party at our place in celebration. Today we went to the pediatrician for her 1-year wellness visit, and it got me thinking about how much has changed since last January when she was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of growth, physical and otherwise, babies go through in the first year is astounding. While it doesn’t sound crazy for someone to have gained 16 pounds in that length of time, consider that that almost quadrupled her weight. She has also added 10 inches to her height, grown a considerable amount of hair and sprouted 8 teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a year’s time, she’s gone from a blob who could barely see a foot in front of her face to a tiny person who can point out details when prompted to, and who quizzically asks (in her baby language) what things are. She couldn’t control her own body back then, now she walks and runs everywhere, grabs tiny objects, feeds herself and pets the cat without hitting her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmentally, the change from infant to toddler is nothing short of incredible. So many things are taken for granted because they are just part of everyone’s life. What kind of “normal” things amaze you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least, that's what &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Johannes_St%C3%B6ffler"&gt;Johannes Stoeffler&lt;/a&gt; quickly came to realize.  Born in 1452 in which is now Germany, Stoeffler excelled as a scholar and later established himself as the parish priest for his native town of Justingen.   In addition to his religious duties, Stoeffler became famous for his learning in such diverse fields as astronomy, mathematics and astrology as well as designing and constructing complex astronomical instruments, clocks, and &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Orrery"&gt;orreries&lt;/a&gt;.  He also wrote a manual on the construction and use of the astrolabe and corresponded regularly with some of the leading intellectuals of the 15th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1499, when Stoeffler confidently predicted that a universal flood would cover the world on February 24, 1524, people paid attention.   Stoeffler based his prediction on the various planetary conjunctions that would happen in that year.  While only six planets were known at the time, almost all of them (including the sun) would be in conjunction in the constellation of Pisces and, given that this was the sign of the fish,  it surely meant that the world would be drowned.  While he was hardly the only doomsday prophet of his time, he was certainly the most prominent.  By 1507, Stoeffler occupied the first-ever chair of astronomy and mathematics at the University of Tubingen and was eventually elected rector in 1522.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

As the dreaded prophecy date drew closer, more and more people heard about the prediction.  Not only was Stoeffler a respected academic, but he was also an advisor to royalty which made him a credible source.  More than one hundred pamphlets were written about the impending catastrophe and the panic set in.  Property in valleys, along river banks, or on the sea coastline was sold at a loss (the fact that there were still willing buyers didn&amp;#39;t seem to reassure anyone).  Although some skeptics suggested that the planetary conjunction wouldn&amp;#39;t be as fatal as predicted,  the fear of impending doom still persisted.  English astrologers, not wanting to be upstaged by their European counterparts, announced that the universal deluge would occur on February 1, 1524 (and the first rainfall would occur in London, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 1524 proved to be an unusually dry year, the preparations for a flood continued.  In London, true believers built an elevated fortress at the &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/St_Bartholomew-the-Great"&gt;Priory Church of St. Bartholomew the Great&lt;/a&gt; and equipped it with two months worth of provisions. On February 1, more than twenty-thousand Londoners abandoned their homes and gathered on surrounding hillsides to wait for the rain to come.   When the predicted universal deluge proved to be a wash (sorry, couldn&amp;#39;t resist), everyone just went home again.  To cover their embarrassment, English astrologers announced that their calculations were out by one hundred years and that February 1, 1624 was the true date for the Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In continental Europe, meanwhile, February 24 drew closer and preparations continued to be made despite the debacle in England.  Boat builders became rich as landowners and nobles prepared emergency arks for their own survival.  Local merchants played up the Apocalypse angle by stocking their shelves with a variety of emergency supplies and prepared to do brisk business.  River banks across Europe were dotted with new boats laden with all the food and water they could safely carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the various known arks to be built, the most ambitious was by a German count named von Iggleheim who constructed a luxury, three-story ark for his friends and family.   At the crack of dawn on February 24, von Iggleheim boarded his ark and had his servants drag assorted supplies up the gangplank.   Crowds had gathered, mostly out of curiosity, although some of them were having fun at von Iggleheim&amp;#39;s expense.  The jeering stopped when the rain started however.  While it wasn&amp;#39;t a particularly impressive rainstorm as such, it was enough to panic the crowd.  Hundreds were killed in the stampede that followed and then they turned their attention to von Iggleheim&amp;#39;s ark and the other ships nearby. When von Iggleheim refused to allow any of them aboard, he was dragged off his ship and stoned to death by the crowd.   The panic only ended when the rain stopped (though the corpses still remained).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When 1524 eventually proved to be one of the driest years on record, Johannes Stoeffler shamefacedly revised his calculations and concluded that the Great Flood would come in 1528.  Nobody really took notice when the new date passed without incident.  He died in 1531 (of plague, not drowning) and is mainly remembered for his accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics.   Stoeffler&amp;#39;s example hardly stopped new predictions of apocalypse however.    During the 17th century,  astrologer and Rosicrucian &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Johann_Jacob_Zimmermann"&gt;Johann Jacob Zimmerman &lt;/a&gt;became famous for announcing that the Apocalypse would occur in the fall of 1694 and that the Pennsylvania wilderness would be the best place to observe the world&amp;#39;s end.  With forty fellow enthusiasts, he made arrangements with the Governor of Pennsylvania to build a small settlement which he named the &amp;quot;Society of the Women of the Wilderness&amp;quot; (despite the fact that most of his followers were men).  The proposed settlement would allow Zimmerman&amp;#39;s followers to live a utopian existence of quiet contemplation while waiting for the end.  Sadly, Zimmerman died unexpectedly before he could accompany his supporters as they left Rotterdam.  The planned community went ahead under the leadership of Zimmerman&amp;#39;s second-in-command, Johannes Kelpius.    The settlement, near what is now &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wissahickon_Creek"&gt;Wissahickon Creek, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, is still the stuff of local legend and managed to survive the non-ending of the world in 1694.  The settlement only dissolved with Kelpius&amp;#39; death fourteen years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you would think that people would have become leery of apocalyptic prophecies by this time, you would be mistaken.  Virtually every new generation seems to spawn another prophet of doom proclaiming the imminent end of the world.    Even Isaac Newton wrote a treatise offering his own estimation of when the world would end (&lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2010/06/newtons-revelation.html"&gt;it was published after his death&lt;/a&gt;).  Famous prophets of the 18th and 19th century included such notables as  &lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2010/02/making-a-prophet-part-2.html"&gt;Joanna Southcott&lt;/a&gt; with her box of prophecies and  &lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2010/07/laying-eggs.html"&gt;Mary Bateman&lt;/a&gt; with her Hen of Doom.  Well into the 20th century, apocalyptic prophecies continued to be announced linked to &lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2008/07/after-the-prophecy.html"&gt;spirit messages&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2010/08/comet-crazy.html"&gt;celestial signs&lt;/a&gt;.  Now that the dreaded &lt;a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/2012"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; date approaches, the latest apocalypse craze is unfolding but it will hardly be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, an ambitious new project is underway in the state of Kentucky.  Organized by creationist group, Answers in Genesis (and heavily funded by the state of Kentucky), the proposed theme park will feature a &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/planned-noahs-ark-encounter-park-kentucky-sparks-church/story?id=12326873"&gt;full-scale replica of Noah's Ark&lt;/a&gt;.  While the creationists behind this project are obviously unaware of poor Count von Iggleheim&amp;#39;s tragic fate, it would probably be a good idea for them to hope for clear weather.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s far from romantic. Whether this Valentine’s day sparks a new relationship or celebrates an old one, we think it’s a great reminder that relationships should make us happy and healthy, not weigh us down. So eat your truffles, make reservations for a swanky restaurant with no calorie count on the menu, and then remember FitSugar’s tips for &lt;a href="http://www.fitsugar.com/How-Stay-Healthy-Fit-While-Dating-13453976"&gt;staying healthy and fit when you’re in a relationship&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Baby, It’s Cold Outside (So Bundle Up and Get Your Ass Out There):&lt;/strong&gt; If the idea of going to the gym with your significant other doesn’t rock your world, get moving together outside. And just because it’s winter doesn’t mean you have to put this idea on hold: Try snowshoeing, skiing, snowboarding, or just going for a walk through a (well-groomed) city park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Couple That Cooks Together, Stays Healthy Together —&lt;/strong&gt; Cooking together can be even more fun and romantic than being waited on (sometimes), and we tend to eat less and eat healthier when we make our own food. Get into the habit of having homemade brunch on Sundays or making dinner together on Tuesdays; your waistband will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Red, Red Wine —&lt;/strong&gt; The beverage that made UB40 swoon is also a healthy choice when you’re out for drinks with a date. One glass has far fewer calories than many cocktails, and in moderate amounts, it can even have certain health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Dance With Each Other, Not the Stars —&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of watching has-beens hit the dance floor on TV, try watching each other on the dance floor. You’ll burn calories and bond over signature dance moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Walk to Dinner —&lt;/strong&gt; Walk to your neighborhood bar or restaurant once in awhile instead of driving or taking a cab to the hot new spot downtown. You’ll burn a few extra calories, and the after-dinner walk will also improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Play Coach —&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever roles you play in bed, playing each others’ coach in life can help you boost your healthy lifestyle. Want to learn how to play tennis? Enlist your partner to help you practice your serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Let Farmers Escort Your Date —&lt;/strong&gt; Go to a local farmer’s market together: You’ll get to pick up ingredients for a wholesome meal, get some exercise, and enjoy the outdoors together. We like it when dates are this efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Plan a Getaway —&lt;/strong&gt; Get out of town and explore a new town, park, or museum together. You’ll log some serious time walking or biking around while you explore (which will make you appreciate that sexy hotel bed all the better).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/f7vrd/so_i_tried_to_start_a_secular_student_club_at_my/"&gt;incredible testimonial on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; from a high school student in Oklahoma who wanted to begin an atheist group his junior year.  After word about the group got out on Facebook, the student was called in to the principal’s office…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… On my way there I couldn’t for the life of me figure out why I was going. I walked into the office with a myriad of dirty looks directed straight towards me. I found my way to the main principal’s office when the door was slammed behind me. &lt;strong&gt;The first words out the principal’s mouth were “I have information that you are trying to start a school led hate group”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following my meetup with the principal the [faculty] sponsor we had lined up mysteriously told me that she was unable to sponsor the club. When I asked for a reason she told me that she was told it would be a very bad career move…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this entire ordeal, the SSA was there to support him and guide him through the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student is now a senior at the high school.  He may not have started a group, but he says he learned a lot throughout the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I learned about the politics involved with the education system and that social pressure is more powerful than I thought. I also learned that no matter how far someone geographically is, they can still be there for you. Throughout this whole ordeal the staff at the Secular Student Alliance was there to talk with me and help me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our staff is incredible about helping students who are atheists — especially in states where that perspective is so unpopular.  And it won’t be long before we seriously expand our high school outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story also stresses to me the importance of faculty sponsors for groups like these.  I’ve always said to myself I wouldn’t mix my activism with my work.  But after reading this, how could I possibly refuse to be the sponsor of an atheist group at my school?  I couldn’t.  I don’t need to wait until I have tenure to say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability and desire, &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/node/8"&gt;please consider supporting the SSA&lt;/a&gt;.  Help us help students like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to everyone for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worry in all such EOTWAWKI (end of the world as we know it) predictions is that some poor souls DO take such predictions seriously, in the face of failure after failure. But people have been known to sell their homes, give away their belongings, even commit suicide -- and even take the lives of their loved ones.

And revealing. And useful. They'll change your perspective on Google Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise of the petition to Google to stop serving up creationist claptrap is a misconception. Google Scholar does not index on content; it can&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s just a dumb machine sorting text. Google Scholar does not, and this is the surprise to me, index on the source — it makes no decision based on whether it&amp;#39;s an article from &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; or from a kindergarten Sunday School class fieldtrip. There's nothing they can easily tweak to exclude garbage from one source and include jewels from another: the internet is one big garbage heap to Google, and they'll dig for you, but it's your job to sort gems from trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way items get on Google Scholar is based entirely on whether they're &lt;i&gt;formatted&lt;/i&gt; like a scholarly paper. They aren't sharing the details, but it has to be fairly general stuff, like having a title and author and not being surround by advertising bric-a-brac, or whatever. Any ol' nonsense will do, since they don't evaluate content, and any ol' author will also do, since they don't care if it's being published by the university or the insane asylum, just make it look sort of like a serious paper, and it will show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you know how Answers in Genesis can find their twaddle on Google Scholar. If there's anything they're good at, it's &lt;i&gt;pretending&lt;/i&gt; to be scientific, going through the motions while demolishing the substance. This is good information to have, actually, and you should pass it on to your students, and take it into account when using the service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/how_to_game_google_scholar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_P4iHMUO7GU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295983007388"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=50567">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed43ba6414073cc4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="hand washing"/><title type="html">Busting Docs Who Don't Wash Their Hands</title><published>2011-01-25T19:00:54Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T19:00:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/jbzsRf9Joiw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/busting-docs-who-dont-wash-their-hands/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Here's an interesting method of combating the hand-hygiene problem discussed at length in SuperFreakonomics: "A doctor enters a hospital room to examine a patient, but neglects to wash her hands.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that in some respects we do have control over our health. By exercising, eating nutritious foods and not smoking, we reduce our risk of heart disease and cancer. But the belief that a fighting spirit helps us to recover from injury or illness goes beyond healthful behavior. It reflects the persistent view that personality or a way of thinking can raise or reduce the likelihood of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most powerful is the point that if we encourage the idea that certain people heal themselves through power of mind, we’re also in effect encouraging the idea that certain people who don’t get better have failed in some way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very early in my career, I participated in a study of young women who were hospitalized and awaiting the results of biopsies to determine if they had cervical cancer. While I was interviewing one of my patients, the biopsy results of the woman in the next bed came back to her — negative. The fortunate woman’s father, who was there with her, said in relief: “We’re good people. We deserve this.” It was a perfectly understandable response, but what should my patient have said to herself when her biopsy came back positive? That she got cancer because she wasn’t a good person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult enough to be injured or gravely ill. To add to this the burden of guilt over a supposed failure to have the right attitude toward one’s illness is unconscionable. Linking health to personal virtue and vice not only is bad science, it’s bad medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the whole oped &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/opinion/25sloan.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;amp;emc=tha212"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I was a bit surprised that Sloan does not expressly deal directly with the topic of &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=stress-dangers"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;. My understanding is that it really can be bad for you, and this is presumably something a change in mindset could help to reduce–it would be interesting to hear Sloan’s take.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295977841613"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/its_a_lens_to_concentrate_the.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f468c330daa24f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">It's a lens to concentrate the weirdness</title><published>2011-01-25T17:33:46Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T17:33:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/BbAPFysRVqU/its_a_lens_to_concentrate_the.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/its_a_lens_to_concentrate_the.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a strange world we live in that I could make an offhand quote on my blog and someone turns around and makes it into a demotivational poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alert WEIT-blog reader Dominic has drawn my attention to a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6WNH-51FGT0V-3&amp;amp;_user=929531&amp;amp;_coverDate=11%2F11%2F2010&amp;amp;_alid=1615068772&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_origin=search&amp;amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;amp;_cdi=6963&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_st=13&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_ct=1&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=929531&amp;amp;md5=469dad8ebbc864455a96d0fe55fbef30&amp;amp;searchtype=a"&gt;not yet published study of clouded leopards&lt;/a&gt;, that I’d seen &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9369000/9369238.stm"&gt;mentioned by the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, but I had not seen the actual paper (well, actually, nobody has seen the actual &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt;– more below on this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27110" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/clouded-leopards-and-the-species-problem/clouded_leopard-wiki/"&gt;&lt;img title="Clouded leopard by Vearl Brown, from Wikipedia." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/clouded_leopard-wiki.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=330" alt="" width="500" height="330"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clouded leopard by Vearl Brown, from Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two issues here, both of which we’ve considered before here at WEIT. First is the species concept issue, which both Jerry and I mentioned recently (links to Jerry’s posts in &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/tuataras-and-the-species-problem/"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;). The second is a scientific nomenclature issue, one that arose in &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/darwinius-whats-at-issue/"&gt;the infamous &lt;em&gt;Darwinius&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The species concept issue also comes in two parts. First, are the mainland clouded leopard (&lt;em&gt;Neofelis nebulosa&lt;/em&gt;) and the insular clouded leopard (&lt;em&gt;Neofelis diardi&lt;/em&gt;) distinct species? And, second, among the insular clouded leopards, are the Bornean and Sumatran populations distinct? The first issue was the focus of two papers in 2006 which raised the insular leopards to full species status. Normally, the raising of insular forms to full species status on the basis of being different from the mainland form raises a warning flag for me, but there is an additional consideration which I think in this case supports the raising to full species status. This is that the islands of Borneo and Sumatra are on the Sunda Shelf, and thus were connected to the mainland as recently as about 10,000 years ago (see Harold Voris’s &lt;a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/zoology/zoo_sites/seamaps/default.htm"&gt;superb series of paleo-bathymetric maps&lt;/a&gt; of the Sunda Shelf for details). So, the insular and mainland forms were in contact very recently, and one good explanation for why this contact would not have led to an erosion of the genetic differences between them is that they were reproductively isolated (i.e., different species). There are other possible interpretations, but the recent contact combined with observed differences certainly makes the 2-species taxonomy reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new, unpublished, paper argues not for a new species, but for dividing the insular form into two subspecies, one from Borneo and one from Sumatra. (A subspecies is recognized when there is a particular pattern of geographic variation within a species, namely that there is a geographic segment of the species’ range within which individuals can be distinguished from individuals from other parts of the range. Basically, if you can tell where an individual is from by the way it looks, or, if you tell me where the individual is from, I can tell you what it looks like, then you can name a subspecies.) This seems perfectly reasonable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that they describe a new subspecies in the paper (rather than reviving a previously described one), but they have also posted a pre-print online and allowed press coverage. Online posting does&lt;em&gt; not&lt;/em&gt; constitute publication in the formal sense, and their paper will soon be published on paper. But by generating press coverage (the BBC has included the new name in its coverage) and posting online, they increase the chance that the name will be formally published &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; their paper appears in print, either accidentally, or on purpose by an unscrupulous individual wanting to steal credit for their work (it does happen). This was part of the problem with &lt;em&gt;Darwinius&lt;/em&gt;: the name &lt;em&gt;Darwinius&lt;/em&gt; was bandied about before the name was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors are actually compounding a problem they created for themselves earlier: they published the new name in 2007 (I have not seen this paper), but now consider their proposal at the time nomenclaturally defective, and the name not nomenclaturally available from that publication. (The technical term for what they now regard their 2007 effort is a &lt;em&gt;nomen nudum&lt;/em&gt;: a nude name, i.e. a name without a proper description accompanying it, and thus not available for use as a scientific name). The nomenclature of this name could be confused. I hope their paper appears soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing highlighted by this paper that I want to unreservedly endorse is the use of camera traps for the study of elusive large mammals. These traps have helped with studies of a number of species, including several big cats: &lt;a href="http://www.jaguarnetwork.org/pdf/45.pdf"&gt;jaguars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Return_of_the_Jaguar.html"&gt;(including Arizona jaguars)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9306000/9306399.stm"&gt;Saharan cheetahs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050912075519.htm"&gt;Asiatic cheetahs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/a-stealth-camera-that-captures-big-cats/?scp=2&amp;amp;sq=tiger+camera&amp;amp;st=nyt"&gt;tigers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as clouded leopards. The BBC, NYT, and other media often highlight the results of these studies. Recently, camera traps revealed an unexpected &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8998000/8998042.stm"&gt;high-altitude population of tigers in Bhutan&lt;/a&gt;, in a valley where three big cats– leopard, snow leopard, and tiger– all live together.&lt;/p&gt;

Discovery of a Viral NLR Homolog that Inhibits the Inflammasome

In order to respond to a virus, a cell first has to recognize that it&amp;#39;s there. There are a lot of ways the cell tries to do this - some receptors (like the TLRs I study) look for features that are unique to pathogens that are outside the cell. Others look for molecules (like DNA and RNA) that are shared between us and pathogens, but are in the wrong place (DNA outside the nucleus is a pretty sure sign of infection).

NOD-like receptors (that&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;NLR&amp;quot; from the title) are a bit different - they seem to recognize signs of infection, rather than the infection itself. Viruses can be like a bull in a china shop; TLR&amp;#39;s see bulls, NLR&amp;#39;s see the smashed plates. When NLRs see the damage, they respond by forming the inflammasome (which I&amp;#39;ve reviewed before), and kicking off an immune response. 

Inflammation is usually (though not always) bad for bugs, so many pathogens have evolved ways to escape detection. Often, this involves hiding to avoid detection (like ERV&amp;#39;s sombreros), but other times they make proteins that throw gum in the works - screwing up vital processes.

Gregory et. al. found an example of the latter - a protein called Orf63 made by Kaposi&amp;#39;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which looks like an NLR. The similarity is more than just coincidence. In order for NLRs to form the inflammasome, a lot of them have to come together and associate with a bunch of other proteins. Orf63 pretends to be an NLR, so it gets pulled into the complex, but it can&amp;#39;t associate with all of the accessories. 

Once the virus infects a cell, it makes a bunch of Orf63. By the time the NLRs start seeing all the evidence of KSHV screwing with the cell, it&amp;#39;s too late; Orf63 effectively blocks all inflammasome activity in the cell. 

Like I said - devious little bastards.

A lot of people focused more on the driverless cars than I meant to (I was just using that as one example of AI monetizing) but it is an interesting topic. Presumably it’s why I got so many comments (hundreds between my website, email, and other places). I’ll give my thoughts on some of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some people said “that isn’t interesting, science fiction writers have been talking about this for decades.” Maybe they have. The closest thing to my vision that I’ve seen is Minority Report. I remember a scene with cars zipping by at incredible speeds. I think they were levitated though. I haven’t seen anything that resembles what appears to be the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may have been written about, in fact it probably has many times, but like 99.9% of the population I haven’t read it. I’d be happy to if someone has a good recommendation. Though I’m always optimistic about the genre I find most sci-fi to be poorly written crap. Like most niche genres (fantasy, western, romance, etc.) the fact that it caters to a pre-disposed segment of the population (in this case, people who like to think about science and technology, of which I am one) means the writing has to be much less good to achieve a level of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my list of benefits of driverless cars, I compacted the timeline greatly. I see the transition occurring in the following three stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1: All cars on the roads have drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 2: Some cars have drivers, some don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 3: All cars on roads are driverless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line between stages 1 and 2 will be very blurry, but it will be drawn in the history books somewhere around now. (Humorously, many people said “cars can’t drive around on the streets by themselves yet,” apparently oblivious to the fact that Google’s cars already are.) As some commenters mentioned, we’re moving increasingly in that direction now. Dynamic Cruise Control matches the speed of your car to that of the car ahead of you. Cars can parallel park themselves. They can hit the breaks to prevent you from getting in an accident when the driver ahead of you stops abruptly, and they can warn you when you’re coming out of your lane. These aren’t the techs in labs either; they’re in models you can currently buy, many of which aren’t very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line between stages 2 and 3 will simply be government regulation. Stage 2 will last for years, and maybe even a few decades, and then it will end when the government says “within 10 years all cars on public roads must be driverless”. The real shame is that there’s no politically and technologically feasible way to skip a protracted Stage 2. All the best stuff (like the highly increased average speed) will have to wait until Stage 3, and to be honest Stage 2 is far harder of a technological problem. If we were able to start from the ground up, designing both our system of roads and our automobiles we could easily have driverless cars now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people pointed out that government regulation will inhibit Stage 2. I’m not so sure. For one, it’s clearly legal now or Google wouldn’t be doing it. I can’t imagine they’d be dumb enough to have cars driving themselves around the streets of San Francisco without asking their legal team what the risks were in advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this technology must be in the late stages. Google doesn’t want the PR nightmare that would ensue if one of their cars hit a pedestrian or t-boned some old lady at an intersection. If Google has these cars out there logging hundreds of thousands of miles, you can be sure they’re pretty damn safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And really, why wouldn’t they be? We’ve had driving simulations for decades. Once the car’s sensors do a good enough job of modeling the reality around them, the rest is nothing more than a video game. If an AI can race competitively in the latest Gran Turismo why can’t it drive around New York? Is it really that hard to detect other cars, pedestrians, stop signs, traffic lights, etc? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a strong chance that by the time regulation even addresses this issue it will be solved. The NTSA won’t have to guess about safety, they’ll have hard data. My guess is it wouldn’t be hard for computers to do a better job driving our cars than we do. It turns out we’re pretty awful at it, and the proliferation of smart phones is making us materially worse. Texting and driving is believed by many to be both more dangerous and more common than driving drunk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people said we’ll see full automation in airlines first, for regulatory reasons. I don’t believe it. People are decidedly and predictably irrational when it comes to air travel. Certainly we could have this technology there, but one airline crashing would cause a groundswell of opposition that you’d need 10,000 cars crashing to accomplish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take 9/11 for instance. After the planes hit the towers, air travel decreased markedly, and miles driven shot up. More people died as a result of the extra driving due to the terrorist attack than on the planes during it (at least &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_3_165/ai_112943643/"&gt;according to one researcher&lt;/a&gt;). People fear flying in a way that is psychologically understandable but statistically irrational. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end of the coin, people hate driving. In fact a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/opinion/30brooks.html?_r=1"&gt;long commute&lt;/a&gt; actually makes you more unhappy than a bad marriage. A number of people like driving and there will certainly be racetracks for them, but I think most would agree that the benefits of complete automation vastly outweigh the hobby of a minority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people didn’t like my thought that urbanization will reverse. I’m using “urbanization” to mean specifically living in cities and not suburbs. People will mention that urbanization has increased, but in America that is only because suburbs are typically counted. In fact in the industrialized world people have been leaving cities for surrounding areas for decades. Now in the US, the population in the suburbs of the 20 major cities exceeds that of the population in those cities. I did not mean to suggest we’d all go back to an agrarian society, I simply see the world trending toward one giant suburb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People gave a number of reasons why urbanization would continue instead, but almost all of them are based upon notions of proximity that become antiquated in a Stage 3 world. Proponents of urbanization pointed out that population density leads to variety. This is true now, but that’s an artifact of geography. The real benefit to density is proximity (almost every other characteristic is negative) and the only benefit to proximity is travel time. That travel doesn’t have to be by car, and perhaps even despite cars being effortless and flawless in terms of safety some people will still want to walk for health reasons. (Humorously enough, not having to drive will, I think, lead to people having something like an exercise bike in their car to work out on while travelling.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take restaurants for instance. An Ethiopian restaurant can be found in any big city like New York or Chicago. Good luck finding one in a small city like Akron, where I live. The reason is entirely travel times. When choosing a restaurant, the time required to get there is a deal-breaker. I may be in the mood for tapas, but I’m not ever going to drive two hours to eat it. I’d have to be really in the mood (and the restaurant really good) to even drive half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts a practical limit on the restaurant’s customer base. To start an Ethiopian restaurant, you need to have enough people who like Ethiopian food (or will try it and then come to like it) who can get there within some amount of time, let’s say 20 minutes. In a densely populated city like New York or Chicago that exists. In a sparsely populated one like Akron that doesn’t. Triple the speed at which everyone drives, and you’ve now tripled the geographic customer pool. People could spread out to 1/3 of the current population density and still have the same amount of variety they do now. Akron, it its current density, might just support one then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are almost no benefits of city life that aren’t solely based on travel time and thus eradicated by much faster transportation. Proximity isn’t and end in and of itself. It’s a means to one, which is low travel time. I derive no benefit from having my friends being within 3 miles of me. I derive benefit from being able to go to their house, or meet them at a restaurant, quickly and easily. A friend or restaurant 9 miles away in a Stage 3 world is the same as one 3 miles away now in Stage 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way I’m excited by the thought that I may live to see a Stage 3 world. That is, of course, assuming I don’t get hit by a bus driven by a human beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has to do the following assignment for a class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Read Peter Kreeft’s webpage ‘&lt;a href="http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/20_arguments-gods-existence.htm"&gt;Twenty Arguments for the Existence of God&lt;/a&gt;‘…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluate arguments 6, 14, 16, 18, and 19 and select the one that you would feel most comfortable using when trying to convince an open-minded non-believer in the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an essay analyzing your argument.  Be sure to take into account of the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State the argument in your own words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain the argument’s strengths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain (two) of the argument’s weaknesses (you should consider another reliable Internet source when addressing the weaknesses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain which attributes of God are supported by the argument. For example, Is the God proven to exist actually a personal God? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain how you think that the argument might affect your non-believer intellectually and emotionally.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing on that website’s going to sway you, but if you’d like to amuse the student (and me) as she finishes her assignment, try answering those questions in the most amusing way possible &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not on the list, but here’s Argument 10 (“Argument from Consciousness”) to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We experience the universe as intelligible. This intelligibility means that the universe is graspable by intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence, or both intelligibility and intelligence are the products of blind chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not blind chance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore this intelligible universe and the finite minds so well suited to grasp it are the products of intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m totally swayed.  You?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you respond to this nonsense (outside the context of the assignment)?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve travelled a lot, and so am prepared: I take out my laptop and my toiletries (in the requisite one-liter plastic bag), take off my metal belt buckle (which unsnaps from my belt), remove my shoes and any change in my pocket, and put it all in the plastic containers.  That used to be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not this time.  I also had to undergo this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  They sent me through the &lt;a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/ait/index.shtm"&gt;NEW FULL BODY SCAN SEE-YOU-NAKED X-RAY MACHINE&lt;/a&gt;. You have to face the wall of the machine, put your feet in the imprints on the floor, and raise your hands.  And you have to stand there for about 25 seconds while they shoot a sublethal dose of X-rays though you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  They then saw that I had a (buckle-less) belt on. They made me remove the strip of leather around my waist and send it through the conveyer belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Then they spotted my wallet.  Out with that, too, and through the conveyer belt. I have never before had to take out my wallet when passing through security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  After I had passed through the See-You-Naked machine, the uniformed TSA agent informed me, “Sir, I’m going to have to pat you down on the left forearm and buttocks.”  Which they proceeded to do.  Now I can MAYBE understand the left forearm, where my watch resides, but the &lt;em&gt;buttocks&lt;/em&gt;?  There’s nothing there, since I had already removed my wallet and been &lt;em&gt;completely x-rayed.&lt;/em&gt; And, sure enough, I got goosed by the agent.  I didn’t like it at all, and felt like saying something to him.  I restrained myself only because I knew I’d get into trouble if I mouthed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  Was that enough? Nope.  They then swabbed my hands for explosives, and put the swabs through the sniffer machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what was ludicrous about this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making me remove my belt, a leather strip with only a small metal snap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making me remove my wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;patting down my &lt;em&gt;tuchus&lt;/em&gt;, for chrissake—when the X-ray machine presumably had already told them that there was nothing there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking off my shoes, which were New Balance sneakers with no metal.  Yes, I know the shoebomber used his shoes, but this shoe-removal (which they don’t do in much of Europe) is simply &lt;em&gt;post facto&lt;/em&gt; Security Theater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and I do object to the hand swab, since there’s nothing I can detect that would make them think I was a terrorist (granted, I don’t know all the subtle cues the TSA uses to spot potential terrorists).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing we can do about this, except perhaps ask for a humiliating full-body pat down in lieu of the Naked Body Scan. We are powerless before the impresarios of the Security Theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thank goodness for the awesome Southwest Airlines, which provides comfy leather chairs with plugs—and for Logan Airport, which has free wi-fi. (It’s hidden on their site, but all you need to do is watch a short commercial).  And I have a bagel with cream cheese.  Life is tolerable again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is &lt;a href="http://scienceonline2011.com/"&gt;ScienceOnline&lt;/a&gt; a meeting like no other? Because it’s the sort of meeting where a biologist named Rob Dunn can set up shop in the lobby to ask for samples of bellybutton shmutz that he can analyze for &lt;a href="http://www.wildlifeofyourbody.org/"&gt;biological diversity&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is it a place where such a person will not be hustled out by security, but it’s a place where a whole bunch of people respond by grabbing Q-tips to do their part for science. And &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13micro.html"&gt;you can bet&lt;/a&gt; every last bit of your bellybutton lint that I was right up near the front of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days later, my sample is now thriving nicely on a Petri dish, awaiting a more detailed analysis of its DNA. And &lt;a href="http://www.wildlifeofyourbody.org/plates.html#"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are the rest of the samples from the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

Again. It’s just a matter of getting the internet to behave itself and upload them onto Libsyn. Absolutely annoyed, but nothing can be done until things are fixed here. Should be fixed by tomorrow – and I’ll see about getting another episode out to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However – there’s still some listening or reading to do!&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/archive/category/curiouser_and_curiouser"&gt;Curiouser and Curiouser&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; my column over at the CSICOP site, &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/speaking_of_skeptical_activism"&gt;features an interview with Desiree Schell – &lt;strong&gt;Speaking Of Skeptical Activism:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KS: I’ve read online and  heard skeptics claim during discussions at conferences that  “paralysis by analysis” is inevitable when it comes to researching  skeptical efforts. That there’s no one who would be willing to research,  find resources, fund, or even ask the right questions and implement  improvements to grassroots activism if it were needed. How would you  respond to those claims and where can people look to improve their activist  methods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DS:&lt;/strong&gt; Although there are  books and papers written specifically about effective science communication,  which is an aspect of what we’re trying to do, there really hasn’t  been a lot of research about the best practices for activism [in] science  and critical thinking. There is, however, a wealth of resources on social-justice  activism, political pressure tactics, and labor organizing that’s  been compiled over many years of people planning actions and campaigns  and sharing and repeating the methods that worked. With a little adjustment  [those] successful tactics, and the planning that went into them, can  work for us. (And it isn’t just skeptics who are starting to think  in these terms. For an example of folks working at politics and activism  from a science-advocacy standpoint, take a look at &lt;a href="http://geekmanifesto.wordpress.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;The Geek Manifesto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desiree was kind enough to mention the &lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2011/01/21/1023-campaign-in-australia-token-skeptic-special-episode/"&gt;Token Skeptic episode on 10:23&lt;/a&gt; on her last episode of &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.ca/episodes/95-the-science-of-allergies"&gt;Skeptically Speaking&lt;/a&gt; (episode 95) – part of that special Token Skeptic episode also features on the &lt;a href="http://parafort.com/ri/?p=1428"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Righteous Indignation podcast&lt;/strong&gt;, Episode 82, along with an interview with Eugenie Scott!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of skepticism’s biggest hitters, Eugenie Scott is the executive director of the National Centre for Science Education.

&lt;p&gt;The Pope doesn't even use a computer, and apparently writes all his missives in longhand, with a quill, unless he's still using a stylus and wax tablet. Letting this antique make recommendations about your computer use makes as much sense as asking a mob of celibates to dispense sex advice, and no one would be that crazy, would they? I don't think the Pope has done much research. Someone needs to show him our social networking outlet, the Endless Thread here on Pharyngula, and let's see how quickly he reverses his opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. We've got an internet poll to resolve all questions and determine the truth, a far more sensible approach.&lt;/p&gt;

—Homer SimpsonIn twenty-two seasons of The Simpsons, the eponymous family&amp;#39;s bumbling father Homer has tried his hand at dozens of different jobs, and failed hilariously at most of them. Homer is a one-man illustration of &amp;quot;Jack of all trades, master of none,&amp;quot; the idea that it&amp;#39;s hard to do many different things well. This principle applies more broadly than the curriculum vitae; in biology, it means that living things face trade-offs between different ways of making a living.

A wild radish (Raphanus raphaistrum) flower. Photo by Valter Jacinto.For instance, a plant whose pollen is carried from flower to flower by just one pollinating animal only needs to match that one pollinator very well. But most plants&amp;#39; flowers are visited by many different potential pollinators, and matching all of them probably means finding a middle ground among the best ways to match each individual pollinator. A study of one such &amp;quot;generalist&amp;quot; flower, the wild radish, has found exactly this: working with multiple partners takes evolutionary compromise [$a].

Wild radishes are visited by a wide variety of different insects, including honeybees, bumblebees, syrphid flies, and cabbage butterflies, among others. Each of these pollinators comes to a radish flower with a slightly different agenda. Butterflies are there for nectar, but bees like to eat pollen as well—and bumblebees will sometimes bite into the base of a flower and &amp;quot;steal&amp;quot; nectar without ever coming into contact with pollen. Figuring out how natural selection from each of these different pollinators adds up required some clever experimental design.

The study&amp;#39;s authors arrayed potted radish flowers inside a big mesh flight cage, and then introduced either bumblebees, honeybees, cabbage butterflies, or all three pollinators to visit the plants and circulate pollen from flower to flower. They measured the plants&amp;#39; flowers before putting them in the flight cage, then let the pollinators do their thing. Afterward, the authors collected seeds resulting from the pollinators&amp;#39; activity, grew them up, and measured the offspring to see whether their traits differed. The procedure was essentially one generation of experimental evolution.

Photo by ComputerHotline.By taking DNA fingerprints of both the parents and the offspring, the authors could also estimate the relationship between each parental plant&amp;#39;s floral measurements and the number of offspring it produced, either from its own seeds or by pollinating another plant.

The results are complex. Depending on the floral measurement under consideration, different pollinators selected in different directions, or the same direction, or not at all. One particularly interesting result, though, was in the effects each pollinator had on the &amp;quot;dimorphism&amp;quot; of the radish flowers&amp;#39; stamens—the difference between the length of the shortest, and longest, of the male parts of the flower. Flowers only visited by honeybees evolved less dimorphic stamens, while flowers visited by either bumblebees or cabbage butterflies evolved more dimorphic stamens. Flowers in the treatment visited by all three pollinators, however, evolved to find a happy medium, an evolutionary compromise to work with the different partners.

The way these interactions played out in a flight cage probably don&amp;#39;t reflect exactly how they operate in the wild, but this is a pretty cool result all the same. I&amp;#39;ve written in the past about how incorporating multiple interactions can alter the way coevolution works. Gerbils under attack by fleas are less careful about watching for predators; but for the protists living inside pitcher plants, competitors can help distract predators. Here we have an example of multiple similar interactions pulling a generalized plant in different evolutionary directions.

Good question. Sometimes I wonder that myself. After all, Adams is so far out there, so beyond the realm of rational thought, so full of bizarre conspiracy theories and defenses of quackery that anyone the least bit rational and science-based should be able to see through his nonsense. Applying a heapin' helpin' of not-so-Respectful Insolence to someone as reality-challenged as Mike Adams at times seems like killing a flea with thermonuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do it because (1) there are times when I enjoy it and, more importantly, (2) there are times when Adams so perfectly encapsulates the sheer unreason that undergirds so much of "alternative" medicine. A few days ago, Adams did it again, in fact. His distillation of the nonsense behind so much of "alt-med" was entitled &lt;a href="http://www.NaturalNews.com/031073_science_tyranny.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The downfall of science and the rise of intellectual tyranny&lt;/a&gt;. "Intellectual tyranny." You keep using that term. I do not think it means what you think it does. Not that that ever stopped Adams from going off the deep end of crazy before. And when Adams goes off the deep end, sometimes killing a flea with thermonuclear weapon is not only justified but required.

Because we know humans are prone to these biases. We know this. So we should all become skeptics. We should all ask for &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-positive-evidence-is-there-for.html"&gt;positive evidence&lt;/a&gt; for that which we accept as true. We should adopt a science-based reasoning rather than a faith-based reasoning. Dr. James Alcock defined faith-based reasoning as "belief in search of data."

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commentator on a website discussing the Gaskell affair went so far as to write, "If Gaskell has produced sound, peer-reviewed literature of high quality then I see no reason for denying him the position, even if he believes Mars is the egg of a giant purple Mongoose". That commentator probably felt rather pleased with his imagery, but I don't believe he could seriously defend the point he makes with it and I hope most of my readers would not follow him. There are at least some imaginable circumstances in which most sensible people would practise negative discrimination.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you disagree, I offer the following argument. Even if a doctor's belief in the stork theory of reproduction is technically irrelevant to his competence as an eye surgeon, it tells you something about him. It is revealing. It is relevant in a general way to whether we would wish him to treat us or teach us. A patient could reasonably shrink from entrusting her eyes to a doctor whose beliefs (admittedly in the apparently unrelated field of obstetrics) are so cataclysmically disconnected from reality. And a student could reasonably object to being taught geography by a professor who is prepared to take a salary to teach, however brilliantly, what he believes is a lie. I think those are good grounds to impugn his moral character if not his sanity, and a student would be wise to avoid his classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all true. We&amp;#39;ve got a new wave of creationists like Wells and Ross who are going through the motions of graduate programs to earn degrees in subjects they intend only to repudiate, who basically lie their way through a program of advanced study, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to hire them or even trust them. Marcus Ross, for instance, wrote a whole thesis on Cretaceous paleontology while publicly professing at creationist meetings that the earth is less than 10,000 years old — who in their right mind would hire such a confused and deceptive fellow for a job which involves regularly dealing with geologic ages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren't minor, scientific disagreements, like hiring a paleontologist who emphasizes punctuated equilibrium or neutral theory in his analysis; those are legitimate scientific issues that will be resolved with evidence. These are people who throw out the evidence in favor of their religious dogma, and they are about as anti-scientific as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re about to re-open a search for a tenure-track position at my university. If Jonathan Wells applied, how far do you think he&amp;#39;d get in the review? We&amp;#39;d examine his application with the same impartial eye we do all the others, but the fact that he has demonstrated his incompetence in biology in his books and public speaking events, and has a known malicious intent to &amp;#39;destroy Darwinism&amp;#39; means it would be round-filed very early in the process—and if you were privy to committee comments during the review, they&amp;#39;d probably involve lots of incredulous expletives. Would that be discrimination? I don&amp;#39;t think so. He&amp;#39;s patently unsuitable for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many of the applicants to our position would likely be Christian with varying degrees of devotion — but if their work, the basis for hiring that person, showed no attempt to shoehorn personal and private ideas that I, for instance, find ridiculous, into their science, then it wouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue. Christians believe in something as absurd as the purple mongoose egg theory, this whole bizarre notion of incarnated gods dying to magically redeem us from a distant ancestor&amp;#39;s dietary error, but good scientists are capable of switching that nonsense off entirely in the lab, and are also aware of the impact on their credibility of espousing folly…if they weren&amp;#39;t, they wouldn&amp;#39;t be good scientists (or they&amp;#39;re Nobel prize winners who know they can get away with it now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful about letting personal disagreements on matters of taste intrude on our decisions; if the person has been circumspect about keeping them from poisoning a body of good work, I'm willing to accommodate them. The alternative is that we start rejecting applicants because we discover that they listen to 70s hair metal bands while they work, are fans of the New York Yankees, or put milk in their teacup &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; they add the hot water, all irrational and unforgiveable heresies. It's all fine unless they join a Poison tribute band and start slopping dairy products about with manic abandon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/dawkins_on_gaskell.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/POupMZkeC-c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295963765311"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6543843383376508821">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68124b3ebfdf5ce1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I Met a Former Mormon Bishop in Canada</title><published>2011-01-25T13:29:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T14:09:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/xvkA6AALKA4/i-met-former-mormon-bishop-in-canada.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6543843383376508821/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6543843383376508821" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2011/01/i-met-former-mormon-bishop-in-canada.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, after I spoke for CFI’s Extraordinary Claims Panel in Canada this former Mormon Bishop came up to me and introduced himself. Afterward we talked over a Foster’s Beer. Someone overheard us talking who said to me, “Mormon’s have some really weird beliefs, don’t they?” Yes they do. But then I see no difference between their beliefs and my former Christian beliefs. I learned to think this way because of my wife. She grounds me. I used to say the same thing about other religions and every time she would tell me they are no different than Christianity. It finally sunk in. She’s right. Then it stuck me. There are people who have never been religious at all. When I tell them I am a former evangelical they must shake their heads and wonder how in the world I could ever have believed what I did. I too am stunned at times. Do natural born atheists think about me the way former evangelicals-turned-skeptics think about Mormonism? Do they shake their heads and wonder how stupid I must be to have believed what I did? Some of them probably do. If so, I hope to show that children are taught to believe in their respective cultures because of indoctrination, brainwashing and enculturation. It could have been them too, ya see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6543843383376508821?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Probably not, but it is possible that the rare person is, with the super mutant power of enhanced color vision. OK – I would rather have Wolverine’s regeneration, but enhanced color vision would be cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color vision in vertebrates is a result of the cones in the retina. Vertebrate retinas have two types of light-sensing neurons: rods see in black and white but have good light sensitivity, and so are specialized for low-light (night) vision. Cones are less sensitive than rods, but they respond to a specific range of wavelengths of light – i.e. color. By combining the color information from different cones with different wavelength sensitivities the brain is able to perceive a wide range of colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different groups of vertebrates have different numbers of cones, and therefore a different range and ability to discriminate colors. Birds, for example, are tetrachromats – they have four different cones and can see farther into the ultraviolet than humans. In fact the common ancestor of tetrapod vertebrates was likely a tetrachromat. Most mammals are dichromats with only two cones. It is thought this reduction occurred during the early years of mammal evolution when our mammal ancestors were nocturnal and burrowing animals, and so needed night vision more than color vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many primates, however, (including humans and our close relatives) are trichromats with three cones, and therefore have rich color vision, but not as good as birds. In fact our understanding of the genetics of cones and color vision provided yet another compelling line of evidence for evolution. Trichromatic primates do not have the same cones as their vertebrate ancestors. They did not regain one of the two cones that were previously lost. Mammals have two cones – an autosomal S-cone (a short wavelength sensitive cone), and an X-linked L/M cone (sensitive to median and long wavelength visible light and located on the X-chromosome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime after the divergence of new-world and old-world monkey, &lt;a href="http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/17/3/93.full"&gt;an old-world monkey ancestor underwent gene duplication of the X-linked cone gene&lt;/a&gt;. At first these genes would have been identical, but over time they diverged to become distinct cones with separated wavelength sensitivity. In humans these cone genes are 98% identical. The cones added sensitivity to red wavelengths and resulted in trichromacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research into the evolution of color vision has also led to some interesting findings about human color vision specifically. It seems that humans have a significant degree of variability in the sensitivity of the cones. You have probably heard that some people are partially color blind, because it is standard (at least in the US) to test all school children for color blindness. But you may not have known that there is variability in the other direction as well, and that there are cases of tetrachromacy in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible mechanism for this is that women may inherit two different versions of an X-linked gene for color vision. Women have two X-chromosomes, and in each cell one X-chromosome is inactivated essentially at random. So the retina would have a mixture (a mosaic) of cones from the two versions on the two different X-chromosomes, functionally producing four different cones in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study they found that most women with this condition did not demonstrate tetrachromacy on color vision tests – they still functionally were trichromats. This is likely due to the fact that the cones were not different enough. Although some hypothesize that the optic nerve or perhaps the brain combines the information from these distinct cones and treats them as one stream of color information. However, going against this hypothesis is the fact that 1 in 24 such women (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20884587"&gt;according to one study&lt;/a&gt;) demonstrated four-dimensional (or tetrachromatic) color vision. This means that the optic nerve is capable of carrying tetrachromatic vision and the brain is capable of interpreting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be other mechanisms as well that could result in true tetrachromatic vision in humans. These cases demonstrate the plasticity of biology and the brain in particular. It also demonstrates that spontaneous mutations can result in the addition of function – in this case expanded color vision. Not only has this almost certainly happened in our evolutionary past, but it is happening today in living humans. This is not likely to result in the evolution of tetrachromacy in humans in general for two reasons. The first is that, in our modern society, there likely isn’t any selective advantage to tetrachromacy. Our primate ancestors probably benefited from trichromacy – the speculation being that it enabled them to forage for fruit and vegetables better. But unless we lived in a world dominated by fashion designers and painters, it’s hard to see how tetrachomacy would provide a significant survival advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, humans are a large out-bred population. This does not mean that we are not evolving, but it makes it very unlikely that such a mutation will significantly spread throughout the population. It could by chance become prominent in an isolated population – the so-called founder effect. This has been demonstrated for inherited diseases, but can also occur with favorable mutations like tetrachromacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now tetrachromacy remains in isolated individuals who are lucky enough to have their own mutant power.&lt;/p&gt;

Quantum, frequency, energy, infrared, if you can put it in a hat, they’ll pull it out at random and stick it on their packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One company who likes to use “science” to sell their products is Power Balance. They love the big science words like mylar, hologram, frequency and hertz. But after today, I’m not sure Power Balance and science are gonna be such good friends. You see, some researchers busted their magic hologram silicon bracelet using well, science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it was a team of chiropractors – a profession not universally known for evidence based practice. Indeed, some* chiropractors believe some pretty weird things like in the existence of subluxations. Put simply, this term is commonly used by chiropractors to describe signs and symptoms of the spinal column, yet evidence that these even exists remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.3333px"&gt;In May 2010, the &lt;a title="General Chiropractic Council" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Chiropractic_Council"&gt;General Chiropractic Council&lt;/a&gt;, the statutory regulatory body for chiropractors in the United Kingdom, issued guidance for chiropractors stating that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.3333px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease or health concerns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.3333px"&gt;A similar stance is taken by the &lt;a title="National Health Service" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.3333px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There is also no scientific evidence to support the idea that most illness is caused by misalignment of the spine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emphasis on woo in the chiropractic profession always struck me as kinda odd, since in Australia, chiropractic is a 2 year post graduate course meaning students have 3 years of undergraduate science education under their belts before they even begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s clear that evidence-based practice is not the general rule (again please see *), as evidenced by a cursory glance at any of their websites. Chiropractors claim to treat a wide range of conditions including &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/06/21/australian-chiropractor-claims-to-be-able-to-treat-colic/"&gt;colic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.backtobasicschiropractic.com.au/children/children-asthma.html"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.backtobasicschiropractic.com.au/children/sleep-disorders.html"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.backtobasicschiropractic.com.au/children/children-ear-infections.html"&gt;ear infections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.backtobasicschiropractic.com.au/children/adhd-children.html"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. I addition to this, many &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760163"&gt;chiropractors are also anti-vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and I have blogged about &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/12/04/the-wakefield-in-the-room/"&gt;one such in particular&lt;/a&gt; in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was somewhat surprised today when the results of the Power Balance trial being conducted by the Discipline of Chiropractic in RMIT’s School of Health Sciences in Melbourne were &lt;a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=e2qghr5uu3xn"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, and the results were negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about this trial several months ago, I was not confident the results would come out the right way – and by that I mean that Power Balance is an expensive rubber band, and nothing more, as the &lt;a href="http://www.powerbalance.com/australia/CA"&gt;company itself admits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already been disappointed by the gushing testimony of another chiropractor on the &lt;a href="http://au.todaytonight.yahoo.com/article/6615459/general/bracelet-claims-test"&gt;Today Tonight story&lt;/a&gt; where Richard Saunders showed the magic bands could not be distinguished from placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melbourne chiropractor, Dr. Matt Bateman, said he had tried it on hundreds of his patients, and even staked his reputation on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I felt it for myself. There is so much you can fake – I am not faking 500% strength and stability, which is what I felt – I can’t fake that,” Dr. Bateman said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No word yet from Dr Bateman on whether he wishes to retract his statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in what is another nail in the coffin for the reputation of expensive rubber band, the study found there was no statistically significant change in balance performance brought about by the silicon wristbands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The randomised, double-blind controlled trial tested 42 volunteers on a computerised dynamic posturography device that measures balance and stability. The test was performed three times: once with no wristband, once with a placebo wristband (where the holograms were replaced with two stainless steel discs of the same dimensions and weight) and once with a Power Balance wristband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We saw no difference in people’s balance whether they were using the wristband, wearing a placebo or wearing no wristband at all,”&lt;/strong&gt; study showed Chief investigator, Dr Simon Brice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“…given this study strongly refuted the primary balance benefit of holographic wristbands, the validity of other purported benefits seems highly unlikely.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another author on the study. Dr Jarosz explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“They think it will work, therefore they feel like it’s working.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study will be published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies &lt;/em&gt;, which is PubMed indexed and published by Elsevier. I say kudos to the team for publishing the first scientific study looking at the claims of Power Balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just goes to show, if you abuse science for nefarious purposes, it might just come back to bite you. How ya liking science now Power Balance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;br&gt;
* I say this based on my research, experience and the contact I have had with chiros. I wish to stress, I do not apply this statement the entire profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no surer sign that nothing major is going to happen on global warming in the next two years–except maybe some brutal battles at the EPA. The president can adopt centrist, business friendly talking points and even get himself reelected in that way–but the climate system is another matter. It won’t be waiting for anybody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, a valued correspondent reminds me of a weakness in &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/will-state-union-address-state-planet"&gt;my last piece&lt;/a&gt;, in which I argued that the clean energy message &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the right one for the president to adopt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I think climate scientists should communicate clearly about climate science to address the many misconceptions out there on the topic—and they’re becoming better and better at &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/a-case-study-in-climate-science-integrity.html"&gt;doing just that, in real time&lt;/a&gt;. I also think it’s important to expose misinformation campaigns, and trace them to their corporate and think tank origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not sure that presidents, environmental groups, and even some leaders of industry are wrong to focus on a message about clean energy innovation, rather than warnings of planetary climate instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that there’s no room left for talking about climate change adaptation, which is something that citizens, cities, and states have to be concerned with, but that gets left out of the “green jobs” message–and isn’t an exclusively scientific matter either. There’s a need for the government and president to lead on this subject. I may have more about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
An Iowa House panel will begin hearings Monday on a bill that would repeal gay marriage in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Iowa Marriage Amendment (IMA) seeks to put a question on the 2013 ballot that would define marriage in the Iowa constitution as a heterosexual union –- and thereby reverse the 2009 Iowa Supreme Court ruling that brought gay marriage to the Midwest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not the reason I’m posting this, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What bugs me is how the “nice” Christians are reacting to all this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Several of us plan to bring a token of Christian love (like a small bag of cookies or other treats) to share with homosexual activists who we’ll be encountering Monday,”&lt;/strong&gt; the group [The Family Leader] wrote in a newsletter to supporters. &lt;strong&gt;“It’s time we dispel lies about Christians, by tangibly showing love to people who struggle with homosexuality.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at how sweet they are!  They’re giving everyone cookies!… Meanwhile, they are doing everything in their power to make sure gay couples cannot be legally wed in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s Christian love for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lies are they dispelling, exactly?  That Christians are the biggest barrier to marriage equality in the country?  That they’ve done more harm to the institution of marriage than any of the couples they demonize?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. They’re just confirming those things…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cookie idea makes as much sense to me as those &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/07/01/im-sorry-is-not-enough-for-the-gay-community/"&gt;Christians who hold signs&lt;/a&gt; saying things like “I’m sorry for how the church has hurt you” at gay pride rallies — it seems like they’re our allies, but in fact, they will never come out and say they support gay marriage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, they may not fight it as vociferously as other Christians, but they do very little to voice their opinion either way.  It’s the cowardly way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need are Christians who bravely and proudly tell their church they support marriage equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, keep your goddamn cookie.  Unless you’re opposing this amendment, you’re part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href="http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2011/01/iowa-we-hate-you-have-cookie.html"&gt;Joe. My. God.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: There are some well-said comments below and I wanted to highlight a few I really liked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/25/i-dont-want-your-cookie/#comment-646375"&gt;hoverFrog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They’re making cookies to ease their own guilt about the dehumanising of another group by a group to which they are affiliated. It is nothing to do with supporting gay people and everything to do with Christianity’s favourite game: Doing nothing while patting yourself on the back.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/25/i-dont-want-your-cookie/#comment-646400"&gt;timberwraith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think a bag of cookies is the perfect metaphor for this version of “Christian love”: junk food that contains little nutritional content. It’s not a love that sustains. It’s empty and in the long run, it will ruin a person’s well-being when one is exposed to large quantities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/TEDxCaltech-web-screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot from TEDxCaltech website" title="screenshot" width="560" height="100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, January 14, 2011, the spirit of &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/"&gt;TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design)&lt;/a&gt; was enacted as &lt;a href="http://tedxcaltech.com/"&gt;TEDxCaltech&lt;/a&gt;, one of many independent lecture series that have spontaneously emerged from the bottom up by what I call “ideas entrepreneurs,” creative individuals who want to change the world by spreading ideas in the format modeled after the annual event now held in Long Beach (albeit at a fraction of the cost: $85 versus $6000). The theme of TEDxCaltech was “Feynman’s Vision: The Next 50 Years,” celebrating Richard Feynman’s famous 1959 lecture, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” which helped launch the field of nanotechnology. As Feynman said, “Our imagination is stretched to the utmost, not, as in fiction, to imagine things which are not really there, but just to comprehend those things which are there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feynman was famous for telling stories, so first up on the morning program was Feynman’s daughter Michelle, who recounted what it was like to hear bedtime stories from her famous father. Michelle then introduced Christopher Sykes, the British documentary film maker who cast Feynman’s stories into filmic narrative in his famous film &lt;em&gt;The Pleasure of Finding Things Out&lt;/em&gt; (the phrase inspired by a Feynman quip about why he does science—not to change the world or discover some grand unifying theory of everything, but just for the pleasure of finding things out). Sykes recounted how intimidating it was to initially approach the normally reclusive Feynman with the idea of sitting him down in front of a camera, but Feynman agreed, perhaps because he knew his life was coming to an end because of cancer, or perhaps because Sykes is such a warm and engaging man. Whatever the reason, the world is a better place with Feynman’s voice still engaging us two decades after his death (you can watch&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Pleasure+of+Finding+Things+Out"&gt; excerpts from the film on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks throughout the day were peppered by video clips of Feynman, plus musical performances inspired by Feynman’s passion for drumming. But the meat of the day was in the lectures by scientists, grad students, and even undergrad students who have carried on Feynman’s vision in various fields. To wit, Curtis Wong, a Principal Researcher in eScience at Microsoft introduced us to &lt;a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/"&gt;WorldWideTelescope.org&lt;/a&gt;, “a free interactive storytelling and virtual learning environment providing the highest resolution multispectral imagery of the universe.” It is a 3D tour of the universe, inspired by Feynman’s creative genius in visualizing data in a manner that enhances understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:260px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Kip-Thorne-and-Michael-Shermer-lg.jpg" rel="lightbox[TEDx]" title="Kip Thorne and Michael Shermer at TEDxCaltech January 14, 2011"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Kip-Thorne-and-Michael-Shermer-sm.jpg" alt="" title="Kip Thorne and Michael Shermer at TEDxCaltech" width="250" height="175"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;click to enlarge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afternoon sessions of heavy-duty science and technology talks were broken up with some seriously geeky humor when Caltech cosmologists Kip Thorne (whom I posed with in the picture) and John Preskill played a science-geek version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, complete with the music, rotating spot lights between questions, and slides projecting the question and four-answer options on the screen. Since TEDxCaltech was a tribute to Feynman, all questions pertained to things that Feynman said or did, so of course the correct answer to every question was “Richard Feynman.” Nevertheless, Thorne and Preskill could not seem to agree on an answer so they had to use their three lifelines: 50/50, poll-the-audience, and phone-a-friend. The first question was: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who said ‘If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics.’?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer choices: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Feynman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this question Thorne and Preskill used their 50/50 lifeline and narrowed it down to Einstein or Feynman, and they correctly guess the latter because the former never fully accepted quantum mechanics, much less understood it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two questions went the same way, forcing Thorne and Preskill to poll the audience (we got it right: “Richard Feynman”) and, finally, to phone-a-friend. For the latter, Thorne and Preskill deduced that the answer was either Stephen Hawking or Richard Feynman, so they chose to phone no less an expert than Stephen Hawking, who not only answered his phone, but when Thorne asked him to please come to Caltech to answer the question, there he was, wheeling down the aisle of Beckman Auditorium at Caltech and up onto the stage, where he promptly answered, “Richard Feynman. That’s my final answer.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day wrapped up with speakers discussing Feynman diagrams, the squiggly lines that help particle physicists visualize what interacting subatomic particles are doing when they collide in atom smashers. Even though Feynman diagrams are so useful that they appear on blackboards in physics departments around the world—and even on the side of Feynman’s van—additional discussions noted how difficult it is to actually compute mathematically what is really happened in even the simplest of particle interactions depicted in such diagrams. Nonetheless, Feynman’s vision, and his legacy lives on. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Shermer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295947328497"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=4793">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/475e3d89b78d694d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Favourites"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="You Tube"/><title type="html">Little Kitten – Cats Playing Patty-Cake</title><published>2011-01-25T09:21:56Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T09:21:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/jpWf5PJz1_w/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2011/01/little-kitten-cats-playing-patty-cake/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3iFhLdWjqc"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3iFhLdWjqc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t really surprised to learn that camel milk is being promoted as a medicine. I long ago realized that the human power of belief is inexhaustible. The news did make me laugh, probably because camels are rather funny-looking animals, because I am easily amused, because it reminded me of some of my favorite camel jokes, and because it wouldn’t do any good to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camel milk has been claimed to cure or benefit patients with diabetes, tuberculosis, stomach ulcers, gastroenteritis, cancer, allergies, infections, parasites, autism, even AIDS.  This isn’t really quite as silly as it might sound.  PubMed does list several studies showing health benefits from camel milk. A handful of studies have suggested that &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19459752"&gt;camel milk improves control of blood sugar in diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, but they are preliminary studies that typically compare standard treatment to standard treatment plus camel milk rather than using a blinded control. There are also a few small, poor quality studies suggesting a possible benefit in allergies, in peptic ulcers, in infections such as hepatitis, and in schistosomiasis. All in all, the research doesn’t amount to much. Camel milk can only be classed as experimental treatment. The existing studies justify doing more (and better quality) research, but they don’t justify prescribing it to treat patients.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other properties, camel’s milk is high in vitamin C, low in vitamin A, and low in fat compared to cow’s milk, and it is tolerated by those who are lactose intolerant. It is different from cow’s milk in many other ways that I won’t attempt to list, but the clinical significance of those differences is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of studies suggested reasons for caution. A study in Saudi Arabia, where brucellosis is endemic, showed that the main source of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12718832"&gt;brucellosis infection was unpasteurized camel milk&lt;/a&gt;  and there is &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20560906"&gt;a report of anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt; to camel’s milk in a child with atopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of the American Camel Coalition, &lt;a href="http://www.camelmilkusa.com/"&gt;Millie Hinkle, ND, says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high levels of insulin in camel’s milk and the antibodies, which are much simpler in structure than human milk antibodies, enable it to penetrate deeper into the human tissue and cells [&lt;strong&gt;whaat?&lt;/strong&gt;], which means that the milk has the potential to serve as a major weapon against many human illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She thinks that studies done in other countries on autism, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, Crohn’s, Parkinson’s, food allergies and a variety of other illnesses have been “impressive.” I couldn’t locate the studies she cites for some of these claims, and I didn’t think the ones I did find were “impressive.”  &lt;a href="http://camelmilkforhealth.com/admin/uploads/pubs/etiology%20of%20autism%20-yagil.pdf"&gt;The one she cites for autism&lt;/a&gt; is not original research but just a speculative rumination that includes brief, unconvincing reports of three patient observations and talks about highly controversial and disproven hypotheses as if they were proven facts. She wants to repeat previous studies using pasteurized camel milk; obviously pasteurization is a wise move, but rather than repeating previous studies, why not do better designed, controlled studies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to make of &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6146445"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; I found on PubMed. Its abstract said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camels’ milk, women’s milk and cows’ milk were kept at 30 degrees C and refrigerated at 4 degrees C. This explains the necessity to immediately freeze milk if it needs to be kept even for a few days. Cows’ milk remained good for days if stirred and then turned sour, enabling the making of cheeses and butter. Camels’ milk did not sour at 4 degrees C for up to 3 months. This means that camels’ milk is mainly good only for drinking, as was promised to this animal by the Prophet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it inappropriate to make religious comments in scientific articles? Is religious support pertinent? In Sunni Islam, &lt;a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/071.sbt.html#007.071.590"&gt;the Sahih Bukhari,&lt;/a&gt; one of the six major Hadith collections, does include several verses where the prophet Muhammad is said to have advocated drinking camel’s milk and urine as medicine. For instance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate of Medina did not suit some people, so the Prophet ordered them to follow his shepherd, i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they followed the shepherd that is the camels and drank their milk and urine till their bodies became healthy. Then they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sahih Bukhari’s medical advice is not reliable or even consistent. It also says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healing is in three things: A gulp of honey, cupping, and branding with fire (cauterizing). But I forbid my followers to use (cauterization) branding with fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that mean Muslims shouldn’t bother with any medical treatment but honey and cupping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not just picking on Muslims. Other religious texts also give questionable medical advice.  In the Essene Gospel of Peace, Jesus gave&lt;a href="http://www.healthbanquet.com/enemas.html"&gt; detailed instructions for colon cleansing&lt;/a&gt; using river water and a long-necked gourd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seek, therefore, a large trailing gourd, having a stalk the length of a man; take out its inwards and fill it with water from the river which the sun has warmed. Hang it upon the branch of a tree, and kneel upon the ground before the angel of water, and suffer the end of the stalk of the trailing gourd to enter your hinder parts, that the water may flow through your bowels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather drink camel milk than do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is even a book &lt;em&gt;Love Thine Enemas and Heal Thyself&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-Thine-Enemas-Heal-Thyself/product-reviews/0759675988/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending"&gt;One of the customer reviews&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.com says “This book helps people understand the love of God, in a very intimate area.”  You can find the darnedest things on the Internet! But I digress…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a website, &lt;a href="http://www.camelmilkforhealth.com/"&gt;Camel Milk for Health&lt;/a&gt; that recounts one (only one!?) story about a young man who had an undiagnosed condition that allegedly made him “allergic to all foods…unable to eat or digest any foods, unable to absorb any food nutrients” so that he was “subsisting on a tablespoon of rice and a tablespoon of rice milk per day.” Do you believe that? His parents claim he was cured by drinking camel milk, and they tell how they had to battle the authorities to get special permits to import the milk into Canada. The website announces a symposium to be held in Vancouver BC on February 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; with 3 panelists entitled “&lt;a href="http://www.camelmilkforhealth.com/symposium.php"&gt;Camel Milk: A New Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.” The main speaker is a retired professor of veterinary medicine from Israel who has done some of the research. The symposium is sponsored by an orthodox Jewish congregation, the oldest and largest synagogue in Vancouver. I am puzzled, because camels and camel milk are &lt;em&gt;trayf&lt;/em&gt; (not kosher) and are forbidden to orthodox Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for evidence of possible health benefits, I came across some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel"&gt;intriguing camel trivia in the Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camel milk can’t be made into butter by conventional churning methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Abu Dhabi Officer’s Club serves camelburgers. Bubonic plague has been transmitted by eating camel liver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ancient Roman emperor Heliogabalus enjoyed eating camel’s heel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camel blood is consumed in Northern Kenya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camel lasagna is available in Alice Springs,  Australia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to know these things. Forgive the digression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try camel milk, you can’t. Selling it is illegal in the US. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/16/health/main6685191.shtml"&gt;CBS news report&lt;/a&gt; in July 2010,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA allows people to drink camel milk, but it can’t be imported or sold in the U.S. until a test for drug residues is validated, said FDA spokesman Michael Herndon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could this be a conspiracy by Big Dairy to prevent competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Camel Milk for Health website links to &lt;a href="http://www.cameldairy.com"&gt;the Oasis Camel Dairy website&lt;/a&gt;, which is interesting and has some cool pictures. The OCD is producing camel milk but is not legally allowed to sell it. What they can and do sell is &lt;a href="http://www.shop.cameldairy.com/category.sc;jsessionid=7E2994F4AE4CE6E02F038E15DD0D27AC.qscstrfrnt03?categoryId=2"&gt;camel milk soap&lt;/a&gt; for $5.00 in varieties like “gold frankincense and myrrh” and “rosemary mint.” They also sell camel milk chocolate bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the research seems to be on one-hump camels. It’s not clear whether Bactrian camel milk is equally efficacious. The “one hump or two” question remains to be answered; but there’s no rush, since we can’t get either kind of milk. Jabalicious and other brands have recently come on the market in the UK, but those of us who live in the US will have to either wait for FDA approval or buy our own camel and milk it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First he got struck off the medical register in the UK, then his favourite paper was retracted from the Lancet, then the anti-vaxers &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/02/13/and-so-it-begins-to-unravel-for-wakefield/"&gt;favourite paper&lt;/a&gt; got withdrawn (which they still cite BTW*), then he was quietly removed from his job at Thoughtful House. Following his move to Texas in 2010, the phrase going around the internets was he “lost his career and his country”.  Not only that, he also lost all respect from the scientific community and the chance to ever publish in the mainstream scientific literature ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reap what you sow, then it appears Wakefield’s chickens have come home to roost – and these are not small chickens either. Imagine Brian Deer in a chicken costume, sitting aloft Wakefield’s tower, watching every move with beady eyes (well that was what I imagined anyway). Brian Deer of course being the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;“UK investigative journalist&lt;/a&gt; who exposed Wakefield’s Lancet work for not just “bad science” but for deliberate fraud. Deer has been on Wakefield’s case for some seven years now and was the first guy to blow the whistle on the now infamous paper which kicked-off the worldwide vaccines-cause-autism scare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been following this case for a long time, so I knew the background well, but even I was shocked when I read the three part series published by the BMJ last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deer provides evidence that Wakefield fabricated the clinical data for the 12 kids to make it appear they had suffered neurological disorders soon after they received their MMR. Wakefield had a business plan to set-up a company making kits to detect ulcerative colitis which was projected to make 72.5 million pounds a year. Wakefield received almost $AUD700,000 (plus expenses) from lawyers assembling a class action suit against the manufacturers of the MMR. The same lawyers had paid 50,000 pounds to fund the Lancet study. Wakefield had a patent for a single measles vaccine, which was projected to make him a very wealthy man once he had discredited the triple version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And none of this was revealed to the journal before he published the paper. This constitutes a huge conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reaction from the anti-vaxers has been predictable. Even Wakefield himself referred to Deer as hit-man sent by “them”. On Anderson Cooper in the US, Wakefield claimed it was an effort by the medical community to quash valid research into the safety of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is interesting. Really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because what was so revealing to me – out of all the revelations in the papers from the BMJ – was the fact that Wakefield was offered the chance to reproduce the results from the Lancet paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:13.1944px"&gt;From “&lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5258.full"&gt;How the vaccine crisis was meant to make money&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#808080"&gt;“…UCL volunteered to support his work. It offered him continuation on the staff, or a year’s paid absence, to test his MMR theories. He was promised help for a study of 150 children (to try to replicate his Lancet claims from just 12) and, in return for withdrawing from the January London conference, he would be given the intellectual property free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#808080"&gt;“Good scientific practice,” the provost’s letter stressed, “now demands that you and others seek to confirm or refute robustly, reliably, and above all reproducibly, the possible causal relationships between MMR vaccination and autism/“autistic enterocolitis”/inflammatory bowel disease that you have postulated.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#808080"&gt;“At the time, Wakefield agreed. Then his employer waited. It prompted, waited longer, and prompted again. “Three months have elapsed,” Llewellyn-Smith wrote to him in March 2000, asking for “a progress report on the study proposed” and “not to make any public statements” in the meantime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#808080"&gt;But the study did not happen. The 1998 Lancet research had been a sham. Trying to replicate it with greater numbers would have been hopeless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Wakefield’s claims of “trying to quash valid vaccine research” are lies. He was given the opportunity to reproduce his work – he never did. And it all becomes clear why. A complex lie based on 12 children when amplified in 150, just becomes a bigger lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn’t stop Wakefield from spiralling further down the rabbit hole. I hoped he might have retreated into a corner somewhere, maybe to slap out some more fictional books with forwards by our favourite Mommy warrior, Jenny McCarthy. But given that the man has an ego the size of a buffet in Vegas, sadly, this has not happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, yesterday it was revealed on Twitter by @sthmnookin and @doctorblogs that he’s back stomping the pavements trying to recruit patients for his next favourite woo autism therapy. This time, instead of parents recruited by a law firm, he’s targeting  the Somalian population of Minnesota who reportedly have a higher than usual occurrence of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 18th it was announced that the CDC, the NIH and Autism Speaks National would begin a study to investigate this anomoly among Somali-Americans in Minneapolis. The Minnesota Department of Health released a report in 2009 confirming higher rates of Somali-American kids participating in special education classes for children with autism in Minneapolis. But it’s still unclear whether these data are real or artificially inflated because Somali parents prefer to enroll their children in school-based programs, as opposed to seeking help from autism specialists in the medical community. You can read more about it &lt;a href="http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/dpp/news/autism-fraud-wakefield-mn-somali-community-jan-6-2011"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Wakefield, given that he is incapable of understanding he is a danger to children, has jumped on the bandwagon, sticking his fraudulent nose where it doesn’t belong and addressing a group of parents at a local restaurant in an effort to recruit patients for his own study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="229827371" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/229827371.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="640"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This screen cap was published on Twitter by @doctorblogs and retweeted by @sethmnookin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially Wakefield wants to use the Somali kids as more guinea pigs – as he did in his Lancet study – with the unproven and potentially dangerous therapy of hyperbaric chamber treatment for autism. According to the newspaper clipping, many parents have already signed up. And why wouldn’t they. There is no cure for autism, we don’t even know yet what combination of factors cause it. So of course desperate and vulnerable parents are only willing to agree to participate, even if it potentially puts their kids’ health at risk and in the knowledge that Wakefield is a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much more harm can Wakefield do? Sadly, it seems a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*when a paper is withdrawn or retracted it can be for a number of reasons, including the work has been published elsewhere, something fundamentally wrong with the data has been detected or the data is deemed to be fraudulent. Only under exceptional circumstances will a paper be retracted or withdrawn. When it happens, it means you can no longer refer to it or “cite” it – it has essentially been scratched from the scientific record (even if it is cached on InfoWarriors).&lt;/p&gt;

There is a trust element involved. I trust the sciences. I trust the consensus of the scientists. Why? Because in those areas where I have studied I agree with them. In fact, if believers were to stop and think about it they trust the sciences too, in an overwhelming number of areas. They just disagree with them in those few areas when the sciences contradict what some pre-scientific ancient agency detectors claimed in a group of canonized texts. -- John W.

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/science/25smile.html?ref=science"&gt;the cover story&lt;/a&gt;, I write about smiles.

I talked to David Corcoran about the story for the first twelve minutes of &lt;a href="http://dts.podtrac.nytimes.com/redirect.mp3/podcasts.nytimes.com/podcasts/2011/01/24/25science.mp3"&gt;the latest  Science Times podcast.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two species–Tasmanian devils and dogs–have given rise to cancer cells that can hop from host to host. I &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/science/01devil.html"&gt;wrote about Tasmanian devils in the Times&lt;/a&gt;, and about dogs &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/08/09/a-dead-dog-lives-on-inside-new-dogs/"&gt;here at the Loom&lt;/a&gt;. Now there’s news that the dog cancer (which I want to call &lt;em&gt;Canis cancer&lt;/em&gt; after talking to the scientists who study it) rejuvenates itself from time to time by stealing its host’s mitochondria.

It might be the shape, if not the texture, but I think the answer lies in the Brazil nut&amp;#39;s high concentration of selenium.   Selenium is protective against prostate cancer, and good for testicular development (fetal period . . . sorry guys) and possibly protective against other oxidative-stress-induced ailments, testicular or not.    On the other hand, selenium, at high concentrations can result in DNA damage, and thus increase risk of cancer.  The problem with supplementing, either through tablets, or through consumption of a natural product high in selenium, is that we do not know where the lines of good and evil cross. A second thought is that selenium concentrations in any plant should be dependent on the concentration of selenium in the soil in which it grows, therefore, the concentration of selenium in Brazil nuts probably varies.  This turns out to be the case, with nuts grown in Manaus-Belem more than ten times higher in selenium than those grown in Acre-Rondia.  Someone consuming Brazil nuts may or may not be making a significant increase in selenium intake.There seems to be a lot out in the popular press or online material that selenium will increase a healthy man&amp;#39;s testosterone production, but little, if anything, in the scientific literature to support that idea.   Elevated testosterone, long term, will increase risk of testicular and prostate cancer.  Testosterone, like any other hormone, can be powerful stuff.  Chang, J. (1995).

&lt;p&gt;He just sent me a note about &lt;a href="http://www.astrosurf.com/sguisard/Pagim/Tikal1.html"&gt;a new set he’s created&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s every bit as lovely as the ones from Rapa Nui.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/bogus-power-balance-bracelets-get-pwned/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/6gIMxjr3n5U/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Power Balance technology is supposed to work by…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… harnessing naturally occurring frequencies by programing them into a Mylar hologram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a quote directly from the Power Balance video above, and &lt;em&gt;it’s complete and utter garbage. &lt;/em&gt;Firstly, as a physics professor, I can tell you that the goober in the video peddling this nonsense (and his bosses manufacturing and marketing it) don’t know the first damn thing about “naturally occurring frequencies” or “holograms” – if they did they wouldn’t be putting them into the same sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is quite easy to definitively show that this whole Power Balance scheme is just a big, fat scam.  Just take a look at how skeptic &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Richard Saunders and his crew at the SkepticZone&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how the scam works…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/bogus-power-balance-bracelets-get-pwned/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/B9_6St8XDms/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it’s not just skeptics like me and Richard Saunders pointing out the scam, but it seems the law in the United States is catching up with the Power Balance charlatans as well.  Just look at this article at the &lt;a href="http://podblack.com"&gt;Podblack Cat blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src="http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2011/01/power-balance-bracelet-facing-usa-class-action-lawsuit/"&gt;Power Balance Bracelet Facing USA Class-Action Lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s official – if you’re in the USA and brought a &lt;a href="http://www.powerbalanceclassaction.com/"&gt;Power Balance bracelet&lt;/a&gt;, you can sign up at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.powerbalanceclassaction.com/"&gt;www.powerbalanceclassaction.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And be a part of the nationwide class-action        lawsuit against the makers of the &lt;a href="http://www.powerbalanceclassaction.com/"&gt;Power Balance bracelet. &lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, that’s a triple whammy.  Spread the word far and wide about this scam, because these charlatans are actively marketing &amp;amp; selling this bogus product to far too many gullible customers.  Folks, you might as well burn your money for all the good it’ll do you.  In short, I think it is appropriate to deliver the following message to the Power Balance company…&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, though, Deepak Chopra has been praising &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Montagnier"&gt;Luc Montagnier&lt;/a&gt;, the Nobel prize winning co-discoverer of the human immunodeficiency virus, for tumbling down the walls of science — which ought to be enough to condemn the poor guy right there. But I had to take a look at exactly what Montagnier is claiming, and I&amp;#39;m afraid the only thing tumbling is his credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montagnier claims in several papers that the DNA of pathogenic bacteria emits an electromagnetic signal, and further, that if you dilute that DNA homeopathically so that no DNA is actually present, the water continues to emit that same signal. Further, if you put two vials of homeopathically diluted EMS emitting water next to each other, the signal can move from one to another. And further, only bacteria and viruses pathogenic to humans produce this signal; ordinary &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; does not. It's madness piled upon madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no sensible explanation given for this phenomenon, only some wild-eyed speculation that "water molecules can form long polymers of dipoles associated by hydrogen bonds" that may be "self-maintained by the electromagnetic radiations they are emitting". More madness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to criticize the paper because it postulates a mysterious mechanism with no coherent physical cause, though. I read the paper and call it crap by virtue of the sloppiness of the work. I disbelieve it, not because I'm predisposed to find it unlikely (although I do), but because it's an appallingly bad paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at the gadget he uses to record these signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2011/01/it_almost_makes_me_disbelieve/montagniers_toy.jpeg" width="449" height="357" alt="montagniers_toy.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Awesome, isn't it? He uses a laptop PC with a Soundblaster audio card for analog to digital signal conversion, plugged into a hifi amplifer, which is in turn hooked up to a coil of copper wire. A vial contain the solution to be tested is dropped into the coil. Un-freaking-believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not at all impossible to measure electrical signals with an apparatus like this. I&amp;#39;ve done it myself; when I was a graduate student, I built a fun little gadget which consisted of an electronic circuit board that I etched to create a fine meshwork of thin interdigitating copper lines, on which I would place a larval zebrafish, and with it I could record the action potentials from the Mauthner neuron, a large cell that mediates an escape reflex in the fish. It actually worked reasonably well, but was a bit finicky — the fish had to be oriented just right, there couldn&amp;#39;t be too much water on the plate or it would float away from the contact, and the signals were highly variable in strength. But yes, when an extraordinarily large cell fired off a massive signal (many tens of millivolts!) within a millimeter of the plate, we could pick it up with our apparatus. Of course, it was also wildly sensitive to all kinds of external signals — we&amp;#39;d do our experiments with the apparatus in a Faraday cage, and you could have great fun wiggling your fingers near the plate and picking up all kinds of spurious signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I look at Montagnier's apparatus, which looks even more rinky-tink than my old gadget, and what I see is a sensitive noise detector. It's little more than a fancy small-scale version of a Scientology e-meter, a gadget that picks up on noise in the environment and makes a needle on a dial wiggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look at the 'data' that comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2011/01/it_almost_makes_me_disbelieve/montagniers_signal.jpeg" width="500" height="515" alt="montagniers_signal.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detection of EMS from a suspension of Mycoplasma pirum: Left: background noise (from an unfiltered suspension or a negative low dilution). Right: positive signal (from a high dilution D-7 (10-7)). (a) actual recording (2 seconds from a 6 second recording) after WaveLab (Steinberg) treatment; (b) detailed analysis of the signal (scale in millisecondes); (c) Matlab 3D Fourier transform analyzis (abcissa: 0-20 kHz, ordinate: relative intensity, 3D dimension: recording at different times); Frequencies are visualized in different colors; (d) Sigview Fourier transform: note the new harmonics in the range of 1 000-3 000 Hz.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, all a Nobel prize winner can do is raw screen dumps from his PC, and he can get away with publishing that. But look at the raw data on the top — background noise from a cell-free vial on the left, and a massive homeopathic dilution of a &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; suspension on the right. Woo hoo! How many of you would like to be able to get crap data like that and &lt;i&gt;publish it&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, it's not just my tiny reduction of the figure that makes the scale invisible. They don't say anywhere what the magnitude of the EMS is. I suspect they don't know; they just crank up the amp to the max to get a lot of jangly jitter, and don't bother to calibrate anything.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of other indicators that this is pathological science. They're looking at a minuscule, variable result that is prone to be picking up all kinds of irrelevant signals, yet nowhere in the entire paper can I find the word "blind". This is the kind of experiment that &lt;i&gt;demands&lt;/i&gt; extreme rigor and care, yet the authors don't even bother to describe the protocols used. That's a warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sign is that the paper flits from topic to topic, doing quick superficial experiments with dilutions and crosstalk and chemical treatments. The paper itself is a welter of noise, and is one of the more unprofessional write-ups I&amp;#39;ve ever run across — and remember, I teach undergraduates. They are claiming the existence of a truly remarkable phenomenon. A good scientist would focus on &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; fundamental observation, the claim that they can record species-specific bacterial signals with their crude apparatus, and nail that one down good and hard and believably. But no. They show off some very poor raw data and then rush off to dilute the experiment a trillion fold and claim to see the same signal. I found the first observation dubious, why are you showing me something even more unlikely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, another suspicious sign are the dates. This paper was submitted on 3 January 2009, revised on 5 January 2009, and accepted on 6 January 2009. That's an unbelievable turnaround, especially for a paper with such incredible results, and the revisions must have been trivial to be able to be whipped around in a day. Yet it's an awful paper that I would have shredded in a sea of red ink if it had come to me. Who reviewed this, the author's mother? Maybe someone even closer. Guess who the &lt;a href="http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/bioinformatics/journal/12539?detailsPage=editorialBoard"&gt;chairman of the editorial board&lt;/a&gt; is: Luc Montagnier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work does have some historical precedent, though. This is the same nonsense and the same apparatus that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Benveniste"&gt;Benveniste&lt;/a&gt; was peddling. Is there something in the wine in France? I could almost believe this terrible waste of time was done under the influence of a hogshead or two of the cheap stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lottery.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="lottery" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/lottery.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;h=320" alt="" width="320" height="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is the fallacy that when the jackpots are high, more people play because they “feel lucky that they’re going to win the BIG one!”  Of course, when more people play the lottery it actually &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt; the odds that any specific person will win, yet this doesn’t stop the gullible from scarfing up the lottery tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there’s this horrible headline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://dailyherald.com/article/20101217/news/712189968/"&gt;Wanna win Powerball? Try these numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 13 years, a red ball  with the number “20″ printed on it has been whirling around with its  numerical counterparts in an enclosed Powerball kettle waiting to  potentially make someone a millionaire. That No. 20 red ball has made  its way out of the kettle 49 times, the most of any of the numbered  balls. No. 20 also is the second most common number on the five white  balls that are selected in each Powerball drawing as well, behind 26 and  ahead of 32, 16 and 42, a Daily Herald analysis of the numbers shows. …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This headline and the leading paragraphs of the article play directly into the &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/gamblers.html"&gt;gambler’s fallacy of “lucky numbers”&lt;/a&gt; – in reality there are no more or less “lucky” numbers.  In fact, the past performance of the lottery is in no way, shape, or form a predictor of the next random drawing of numbers.  The article cited above actually does attempt to be at least marginally responsible by interviewing a mathematician, though their discussion is buried in the article…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… While some gamblers may see that information as an edge, mathematicians and oddsmakers say it’s all just luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The numbers and the pingpong balls have no memory,” said  Jeff Bergen, a mathematics professor at DePaul University. “So whether a  given number has come up once or twice or 10 times or never, it is no  more or less likely to come up today than any other number.” …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Exactly.  Unfortunately, the “news” article quickly followed up the math professor’s advice with some anecdotes from believers in these supposed lucky numbers.  So how did the Powerball drawing in question go?  &lt;a href="http://www.illinoislottery.com/subsections/History/Win2010.htm"&gt;Here were the results of the Dec. 18th Powerball drawing:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 style="text-align:center"&gt;04-11-19-33-43 and 14 as the Powerball&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;And remember, the so-called “lucky numbers” referenced in the article were 16, 20, 26, 32, 42, and 20 for the Powerball.  Not a single one of these numbers appeared in the drawing – &lt;strong&gt;NOT… ONE.&lt;/strong&gt; So much for “lucky numbers.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;So how should one win the lottery?  Simple: by not playing it at all.  To sum up the best way of dealing with this foolishness, I like &lt;a href="http://dailyherald.com/article/20101217/news/712189968/comments/"&gt;this comment &lt;/a&gt;which appeared in response to the article:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You have much better chances of most things than of winning the  lottery–getting struck by lightning, dying in a plane or car crash,  etc.  The odds are astronomically low of winning the big prize.  Invest  that money instead, and you’d end up with far more in the long-term,  even with the low interest rates.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As for the “news” paper which so irresponsibly reported this article, I can only say one thing…&lt;/div&gt;

The discovery of Mirror Neurons in Macaque monkeys has lead to theories of the neurophysiological substrate of speech perception being grounded in mirror neurons. This is also relevant to the evolution of speech as if ability to perceive a rapid stream of phonemes is present in species such as macaques then this provides a foundation on which  . . . → Read More: Are mirror neurons the basis of speech perception?...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The paper, The invasive Australian redback spider, Latrodectus hasseltii Thorell 1870 (Araneae: Theridiidae): current and potential distributions, and likely impacts, details recorded sightings of redback spiders in New Zealand, then used  biological and climatic information to reveal where redbacks could  establish. Warm, dry conditions in some eastern areas of New Zealand are suitable  for redback spiders to become established, and they are likely to spread further as they are surviving in places with relatively high  rainfall. Urban areas, for example, provide shelter from the rain. The spread of redbacks is likely to have arisen from the  establishment of new invasions through New Zealand&amp;#39;s ports.

There is genetic evidence that redbacks have interbred with the protected, endemic katipo and there is a danger that redbacks could competitively displace katipo or cause extinction by interbreeding. Redbacks are also a public health issue as they have the potential to become established in areas close to urban populations. Successful border control already produces regular interceptions of the redback as well the invasive brown widow and the western black widow. Both these species are related to the redback and have similar habitat and climate requirements.

I spoke to lead researcher Dr Cor Vink about this work and how they are  developing new approaches and tools to ensure harmful organisms are kept  out of New Zealand.

In other words, "in no uncertain terms" means "in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;certain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; terms", construing "certain" as in &lt;em&gt;certainty&lt;/em&gt;. The earliest example that I've been able to find is this sentence from the Chicago Tribune, July 20 1863:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Our dispatches contain another circular from the Provost Marshal General's office, and accompanying, the voice of the Government, couched in no uncertain terms, that the draft will be enforced in every loyal State, without fear or favor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And "in no uncertain terms" is still being used that way, as in this example from &lt;a href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/finally-getting-some-sleep/"&gt;today's New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;After last week, the question now is: Why am I writing a post this week instead of sleeping?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;When more than 200 people tell you, in no uncertain terms, that the first step to dealing with the exhaustion incurred when a child does not sleep is to find ways and moments for you, yourself, to sleep, that’s a fair question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently, through the miracle of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2918"&gt;misnegation&lt;/a&gt;, this elderly cliché has found a new role in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynthia McLemore spotted an example Ben McGrath's article "&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/01/31/110131fa_fact_mcgrath"&gt;Does football have a future: The NFL and the concussion crisis&lt;/a&gt;", The New Yorker, 1/31/2011:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/InNoUncertain1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ignore the &amp;quot;beg the question&amp;quot; usage — or read &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2290"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; if  equanimity in the face of question-begging is beyond your powers — and contemplate the &lt;a href="http://theconcussionblog.com/about/disclaimer/"&gt;captalized assertion&lt;/a&gt; that "IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS DO I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD OUTLAW OR "WUSS DOWN' CONTACT SPORTS".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we temporarily leave aside the subject-auxiliary inversion ("do I believe" rather than "I believe"), we  take this to say the opposite of what Dustin Fink means. Using the traditional interpretation of "in no uncertain terms", it seems to mean "Emphatically, (do) I believe that we should outlaw or wuss down contact sports", whereas he clearly means "In no way (do) I believe that we should outlaw or wuss down contact sports".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's note that Dustin is not alone in using "in no uncertain terms" to mean something like "in no way", as a search for "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22in+no+uncertain+terms+do+I%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq="&gt;in no uncertain terms do I&lt;/a&gt;" demonstrates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;I am 25 wks pregnant now and I have told my partner in no uncertain terms do I want another one that close!!&lt;br&gt;
One thing to id like to make clear i do know this person and in no uncertain terms do i support his group,in fact he sickens me.&lt;br&gt;
In no uncertain terms do I want my tax money used to issue school vouchers.&lt;br&gt;
i hope that explains that in no uncertain terms do I disagree with ben regarding our military nor do i disagree with him about the situation&lt;br&gt;
thirdly, in no uncertain terms do I excuse rape, or will ever excuse rape&lt;br&gt;
in no uncertain terms, do i want her kissing any of my children on the lips, least of all my infant - ever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now let's get back to that subject-auxiliary inversion. It's an interesting characteristic of contemporary English that with initial negative adjuncts, subject-aux inversion happens just in case the negation takes scope over the following clause. Thus consider this pair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) With no friends, John would be happy.&lt;br&gt;
(b) WIth no friends would John be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentence (a) means roughly that if he had no friends, John would be happy. In that case, the scope of the negation is limited to the interpretation of the prepositional phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentence (b) means roughly that there are no friends such that John would be happy if he had them; and in that case, the negation takes scope over the interpretation of the whole sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This curious connection between form and meaning was the subject of one of my first published papers, "On conditioning the rule of subject-auxiliary inversion", in Ellen Kaisse and Jorge Hankamer, Eds., &lt;em&gt;Papers from the Fifth Annual Meeting of the North East Linguistic Society&lt;/em&gt;, 1974.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that when the people take "in no uncertain terms" to mean something like "in no way at all" rather than "emphatically", they uniformly seem to use subject-aux inversion, as illustrated by these web examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Admittedly, the No. 4 seeded Eden Prairie High School boys soccer team opned Section 2AA play Thursday with a chip on its shoulder. In no uncertain terms did they think they deserved the No. 4 seed and if Bloomington Kennedy, Thursday's opponent, was in any way responsible, they were going to pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;In no uncertain terms will I ever support any legislation that infringes on the rights of law abiding citizens to keep and bear arms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;In no uncertain terms does the mayor condone any behavior of this sort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;In no uncertain terms should hitting your dog be considered appropriate punishment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when people mean a clause-initial instance of this phrase in the conventional, old-fashioned way, they don't invert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;In no uncertain terms she blamed “that spoiled Addison girl” whom Elijah D. had married for the unwashed aspect of that “somber hard-faced boy".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;In no uncertain terms, he wants the press to know that Oswald isn't being mistreated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;In no uncertain terms he told them that Jesus is holding everything together!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be pleased to hear we&amp;#39;re committed to providing the best of everything and in no uncertain terms we feel our unique product offers the best solution …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;In no uncertain terms, he reeled off the news about Iran, why it was bad, what it meant for the markets, why it wasn't priced in to the markets, and what would probably happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — Those of you who have checked out Dustin Fink&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://theconcussionblog.com/about/disclaimer/"&gt;Concussion Blog&lt;/a&gt; will have noticed that in addition to providing excellent information about the issues around concussions in general, and sports-related concussions in particular, it's overall quite a rich source of syntactic innovation: "All information and photos are brought to you via the blog is for the intent of education and communication of concussions"; "WE JUST NEED TO BE EDUCATED AS TO PREVENT LONG TERM EFFECTS AND DEATHS"; "By developing this blog it is the hopes that we can create a community for support, education and communication for this rising epidemic"; etc.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — The Google n-gram viewer &lt;a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=in+no+uncertain+terms,under+no+circumstances&amp;amp;year_start=1840&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3"&gt;seems to confirm&lt;/a&gt; that the phrase "in no uncertain terms" originated in the mid-19th C., and came into widespread use after 1900:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/InNoUncertain2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/InNoUncertain2.png" width="475" title="Click to embiggen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how to explain the apparent fact that usage leveled off around the end of WWII — as often with the n-gram counts, it&amp;#39;s not clear to what extent this is a change in the language and to what extent it&amp;#39;s a change in the mix of books in the underlying corpus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But checks with other sources (e.g. COCA and BNC) do confirm that "in no uncertain terms" has in recent decades become somewhat more common than "under no circumstances".]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295918320998"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f5b8c4a535e4623</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><title type="html">Different Views of our Closest Neighbor</title><published>2011-01-25T01:04:22Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T01:04:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The distance is nothing; it is only the first step that is difficult." -&lt;i&gt;Madame Marie du Deffand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If you've got some solidly dark skies, you might notice -- in addition to the great field of thousands of stars -- a few faint, fuzzy objects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/Andromeda.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/Andromeda-thumb-500x333-60622.jpeg" width="500" height="333" alt="Andromeda.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible with the naked eye (and captured with &lt;a href="http://www.pearsonmusic.co.uk/walton-astro/Widefield/wide.htm"&gt;only a digital camera&lt;/a&gt;), this is the Andromeda Galaxy, as seen from Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a "mere" 2.4 million light years from us, it is the closest large galaxy to us, by &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt;.  As far as our best telescopes can show us, Andromeda looks like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/M31CombineFilesExcAvgDDPPSnew50.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/M31CombineFilesExcAvgDDPPSnew50-thumb-500x332-60624.jpeg" width="500" height="332" alt="M31CombineFilesExcAvgDDPPSnew50.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Mosaic by &lt;a href="http://astropix.nl/images/M31/M31.html"&gt;astropix.nl&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you don't want to use something like the Hubble Space Telescope!  Andromeda is &lt;i&gt;too close&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;too large&lt;/i&gt; to image with a narrow-angle camera like Hubble.  In fact, in sheer terms of angular size, Andromeda embarrasses &lt;a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap061228.html"&gt;even the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/m31moon.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/m31moon-thumb-500x332-60628.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="m31moon.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why limit yourself to what &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; eyes can see?  After all, we know that there are a great many more wavelengths of light that exist, and we have telescopes specialized to see &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; wavelengths, highlighting different parts of the galaxy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/wavelength-light1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/wavelength-light1-thumb-500x314-60626.jpeg" width="500" height="314" alt="wavelength-light1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start in the Ultraviolet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/andromedaUV.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/andromedaUV-thumb-500x404-60630.jpg" width="500" height="404" alt="andromedaUV.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/uv_andromeda.html"&gt;Swift Satellite&lt;/a&gt;, we get a view of more than 20,000 ultraviolet sources in the Andromeda Galaxy.  Most of these objects are hot, young, bright stars, along with dense star clusters.  The galaxy's core, of course, is also very bright in the ultraviolet.  (This image, itself, is a composite of more than 300 separate Swift images!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about the cooler regions?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/AndromedaIR.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/AndromedaIR-thumb-500x294-60632.jpg" width="500" height="294" alt="AndromedaIR.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/1634-ssc2006-14a1-Andromeda"&gt;Spitzer Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, looking in the far infrared, picks up stars (in blue) and great, cool dust lanes, in orange.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those dust lanes are great, of course, and the pictures &lt;a href="http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/public/science/m31.html"&gt;even farther to the cool end&lt;/a&gt; -- in the radio -- are far less exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if we head all the way to the high end of the energy spectrum, and look in the X-ray?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/andromedaX%2BIR.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/andromedaX%2BIR-thumb-500x366-60634.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="andromedaX+IR.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMY1K0SDIG_index_0.html"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shown in combination with Herschel's infrared data (in orange), the XMM-Newton satellite grabs the X-rays, shown in blue, above.  It's only the dying stars -- white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, and catastrophic events -- that give off X-rays.  But if we look at the X-rays alone...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/andromedaXray.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest/andromedaXray-thumb-500x342-60636.jpg" width="500" height="342" alt="andromedaXray.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;i&gt;hundreds&lt;/i&gt; of them, clustered around the center, with X-rays that head straight for us!  So keep in mind, whether you're looking out into space or at the world around you, there's only a &lt;i&gt;tiny fraction&lt;/i&gt; of the light that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; can actually see.  But as our ability to look improves, so does our understanding of our closest galactic neighbor, which in turn helps us understand our own!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/different_views_of_our_closest.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295917459333"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-2679922894494981773">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7355611dc5ce8544</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Manly Monday" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Geekery" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Manliness" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Joss Whedon" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="TV" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Awesomeness" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Manly Monday: James Marsters</title><published>2011-01-25T00:32:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T00:32:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2011/01/manly-monday-james-marsters.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TT4TS4OgznI/AAAAAAAABEY/vLfwKD-lg-0/s1600/Spike.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TT4TS4OgznI/AAAAAAAABEY/vLfwKD-lg-0/s200/Spike.jpg" width="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;James Marsters is The Man. I am, admittedly, heavily biased on this one, as he plays one of my favorite TV characters of all time, William Pratt AKA William the Bloody AKA motherfucking Spike. The introduction of Spike in season 2 of &lt;i&gt;Buffy &lt;/i&gt;may just have saved the show from obscurity after a first season that, let's admit it, was very 90s genre TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, my wife tells me I'm a little gay for Spike. Which is probably true, and I'm perfectly comfortable admitting it. She's okay with it, too, because, in her words, "I think there's something wrong with any dude who's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a little gay for Spike." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Mr. Marsters has done many other things in his long and illustrious career and they're not all on the small screen. His manliness is hardly in doubt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Positive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spike&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Captain John Hart in &lt;i&gt;Torchwood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He wanted to have sex with a poodle. Now &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; omnisexual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;His wiry buffness and overall agelessness at nearly 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's marrying a 24 year old&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I initially resisted including this as it feels like the kind of "manly" shit covered in the douche magazines I'm trying to counter here, but my wife pointed out to me "Come on. If you were 50, you'd sleep with a 24 year old," and I had to agree.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;His turn as Lex Luthor in the animated &lt;i&gt;Superman: Doomsday&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spike&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was kicked out of Julliard. Not sure why, but he was and then he talked shit about them. Manly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; He adapted and performed his own version of MacBeth, which is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seriously, if you really read it you realize it's essentially the first modern horror film, and it's extremely effective&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's been in rock bands and/or performing solo for most of his adult life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He's apparently going to star in a new Syfy series as a former government operative leading a team of superheroes. I'll watch that shit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was also in a SyFy original space western called "High Plains Invaders." I Netflixed that shit as soon as I heard of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spike&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Negative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Piccolo in &lt;i&gt;Dragonball: Evolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not that I ever saw that notorious piece of shit; I didn't have to to know it was a piece of shit. I half wanted to see it just to catch his performance, but apparently the flick was just bad all around.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That's all I really have, but it's so bad that it counts for like five&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; So where to begin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah: Spike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My wife and I had only been dating a few months when she decided to try to get me into two of her favorite shows, &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt;. I had, up until then, regarded them with the utmost scorn. But she knew me well already (to be fair, we had been friends for years before we ever started dating) and knew how to hook me on the shows. She found the fifth season of Angel used at a secondhand game store, purchased it, and convinced me that I'd love it. The reason I would love it? Spike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spike is the kind of badass but vulnerable character that many badasses would benefit from being. Some badasses are just one-note badasses, and that's pretty badass, but being a badass with a heart of gold (even if he doesn't technically have a soul) is what made Spike that much more interesting. He'll kill you if he doesn't like you, or if you look at him funny, or if he's hungry, but then he'll go home and pine away after the woman he loves. He'll try to be better than he is, better than he is actually physically capable of being, for her. He's a layered badass, which comes from his human life as a complete and utter wuss, a romantic, and a failed poet. When he gained the ability to grow fangs and eat people, he pushed back against his human personality, but not before turning his mother in an attempt to be with her forever (aww...). Spike overtook William Pratt, but William was always under there somewhere, and nowhere is that more obvious than in my favorite episode of &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt;, the fifth season's &lt;i&gt;Fool for Love&lt;/i&gt;. It reveals Spike's secret origin and, toward the end, Buffy rebuffs his advances and completely emasculates him in a back alley before throwing cash at him to complete the insult. He starts to cry while desperately gathering the cash (not only does he need it, it's all his love is willing to give him) and no matter how many times I see that scene I never fail to get choked up. Marsters utterly &lt;i&gt;sells&lt;/i&gt; the pain and conflict in the character in that moment, and you're right there with the poor son of a bitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, then he pulls Spike back on like a black leather duster and grabs a shotgun to go and kill the Slayer once and for all. He finds her crying on her porch because her mother has brain cancer, sets down the shotgun, and puts his arm around her in comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a hell of an episode, and Marsters is there at every step of the way making Spike, originally conceived as a one-note badass, a layered and complex character and doing it with style and skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I can't leave Spike without mentioning the fact that, by the middle of the second season of &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt;, Marster's British accent was so good that Brits thought he was a Brit. Hell, I'm so used to hearing him with the accent that he sounds fucking weird when he &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; using it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of his British accent, there's his turn as Captain John Hart in &lt;i&gt;Torchwood&lt;/i&gt;, AKA "Brown-Haired Time-Travelling Omnisexual Spike." He played the hell out of that character and succeeded in bringing some complexity to a character that was really only as complex as Russel T. Davies could write him, which, let's be honest, isn't much. He chews the scenery and wears a weird 18th-century military coat like a fucking man. I'll be sad if he doesn't show up in future seasons. Of which there are supposed to be some. I hope that's still the plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the rest of his manly attributes have been mentioned up in "The Positive" and don't need much elaboration down here. It is worth reiterating that he was in &lt;i&gt;Dragonball: Evolution&lt;/i&gt;, because no Manly Man is without his faults. Except for Teddy Roosevelt, and there was only one of him and there only ever will be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James Marsters is The Man, and if you disagree, you're wrong.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-2679922894494981773?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295915605455"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=32896">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be90b795ab18fc7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">What’s It Like to Have an Atheist Car?</title><published>2011-01-25T00:00:27Z</published><updated>2011-01-25T00:00:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/24/whats-it-like-to-have-an-atheist-car/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Normally, the way people link their vehicle with religion is by putting a few bumper stickers on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_68dc2X9bOzA/THvPheux6qI/AAAAAAAACAc/3CbC02ZULXo/s1600/Christian+Car.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_68dc2X9bOzA/THvPheux6qI/AAAAAAAACAc/3CbC02ZULXo/s1600/Christian+Car.jpg" width="550" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know atheists who have done that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some atheists have taken a different path by purchasing their state’s &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/11/30/34-unconvincing-arguments-for-god/"&gt;ATHEIST license plate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/august_berkshire.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/august_berkshire.JPG" width="450" height="338"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since his state’s ATHEIST plate is already taken (by &lt;strong&gt;August Berkshire&lt;/strong&gt;, above), Minnesotan &lt;strong&gt;Bjorn&lt;/strong&gt; decided he wanted something &lt;a href="http://bjornisageek.blogspot.com/2011/01/atheist-smart-car-aftermath.html"&gt;far more overt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he purchased a used smart car in 2009, he turned it into a driving advertisement for the &lt;a href="http://outcampaign.org/"&gt;OUT Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://minnesota.camp-quest.org/"&gt;Camp Quest of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lCJbp-HZKq4/TTzkZ2_j0UI/AAAAAAAAMRk/HmVLX9E8CIY/s1600/P5280607.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lCJbp-HZKq4/TTzkZ2_j0UI/AAAAAAAAMRk/HmVLX9E8CIY/s1600/P5280607.JPG" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He drove in it for 10 months.  No vandalism or anything like that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he’s ready to buy a new car, what was the result of driving in an atheist-mobile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… A handful of conversations at gas stations and parking lots and a few thumbs up on the highway. I’m sure most of the people I work with have no doubt how I view the God issue, but no one has brought it up. My goal for having the decals was to gain awareness, just as the Out Campaign is supposed to do. I think to some degree, that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is it dangerous to have atheist decals stuck all over your car?…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read Bjorn’s &lt;a href="http://bjornisageek.blogspot.com/2011/01/atheist-smart-car-aftermath.html"&gt;response to that question here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing identifiably “atheist” about my car.  Part of it is because of where I work, but I also don’t think it’s the most effective way to get out our message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s extremely important to be “out” as atheists… to people who know us.  It’s hard to demonize atheists when you know one personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you shout it out to the world in an anonymous way, I feel like the reaction you’d get most often is, “That guy’s a douche.”  Bjorn says he had a good experience overall. I know him personally, and I can vouch for the fact that he’s a really nice guy, so I believe it when he says he’s had positive conversations at gas stations and other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder, though, how many people saw him driving the car and only thought nasty things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a question for all of you: &lt;strong&gt;Would you feel comfortable driving a car that was emblazoned with atheist decals/bumper stickers?&lt;/strong&gt;  (For a moment, put aside your thoughts about the brand/model/whatever of the car, and let’s assume the messages are pro-atheist and not anti-any-religion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In fact, they’re so beneficial that researchers are busy trying to figure out if those at &lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt; risk for heart disease might benefit from taking the prescription meds. But after reviewing the progress of 14 medical trials, researchers at the Cochrane Systematic Review found that for those of us who have low risk for heart disease, &lt;a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/01/20/statins-may-not-prevent-heart-disease-in-healthy-individuals/"&gt;statins may not prevent heart disease&lt;/a&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re all for taking vitamins and supplements that boost our ability to fight disease and illness, but when it comes to prescription drugs — shouldn’t we focus on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle instead of finding drugs to keep our arteries intact while we continue scaring Big Macs and Diet Cokes? There are several known ways to lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and maintain healthy levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol, and a vast majority involve simple diet and lifestyle choices (not pricey prescription drugs). So while researchers spend time calculating whether taking prescription drugs to prevent a disease we’re already at low risk to contract, we’ll stick with our oats and vegetables, &lt;em&gt;thankyouverymuch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve teamed up with &lt;a href="http://www.getsomeheadspace.com/"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;, a modern meditation project aimed at demystifying the mind-bending practice: “there’s no chanting, no sitting cross-legged, no incense and definitely  no gurus … no religious agenda or mystical mumbo-jumbo, just  simple, practical tools to help you find a bit more clarity and calm in  your everyday life,” says their website. Together, Headspace and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; have created a guide: “&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2011/jan/22/how-to-meditate-ten-steps-headspace"&gt;How to Meditate In Ten Easy Steps&lt;/a&gt;,” with videos like the one below to help break down the hows, whys, and whats of mediation practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you practice meditation? Does the “mystical mumbo-jumbo” scare you away, or is that what makes you like it in the first place? If you think Headspace’s no-nonsense meditation methods might be right for you, watch the video above, and check out their &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/audio/2011/jan/24/headspace-mindfulness"&gt;podcast series&lt;/a&gt; — and tell us if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t think of a better example than &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/multimedia/gallery/pia13455.html"&gt;this stunning picture&lt;/a&gt; of a runaway star from NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, aka WISE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOOooo, pretty! Click to embiggen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star in question is the bright blue one in the center of the picture. Its name is Zeta Ophiuchi, and to the eye it’s a non-descript reddish star in the constellation of Ophiuchus (yes, the same one that recently found itself entangled in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/13/astrological-sign-of-the-times/"&gt;the zodiac embroglio&lt;/a&gt;). You wouldn’t look twice at it, but it hides some secrets. For one, it’s not red, it’s blue! It’s actually a supergiant, hot, blue star that’s probably 20 times the mass of the Sun. It looks reddish to the eye because there’s quite a bit of interstellar dust between us and it, and that tends to make light look redder (much like junk in the air &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/blue_sky.html"&gt;makes a sunset look red&lt;/a&gt;).

Or rather, scientometrics has a lot of problems. Scientific careers are built off the publish or perish foundation of citation counts. Journals are ranked by impact factors. There are serious problems with this system, and many ideas have been offered on how to change it, but so far little has actually been affected. Many journals, including the PLoS and Frontiers series, are making efforts to bring about change, but they are mostly taking a social tactic: ranking and commenting on articles.I believe these methods are treating the symptom, not the problem.Publish or perish reigns because our work needs to be cited for we scientists to gain recognition. Impact factors are based on these citation counts. Professorships are given and tenure awarded to this who publish in high-ranking journals. However citations are biased, and critical citations are often simply ignored.Bear with me here for a minute. How do you spell &amp;quot;fish&amp;quot;? g-h-o-t-i: &amp;quot;g-h&amp;quot; sounds like &amp;quot;f&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;laugh&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;o&amp;quot; sounds like &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;women&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;t-i&amp;quot; sounds like &amp;quot;sh&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;scientific citations&amp;quot;. This little linguistic quirk is often (incorrectly) attributed to George Bernard Shaw; it&amp;#39;s used to highlight the strange and inconsistent pronunciations found in English. English spelling is selective. You can find many spelling examples that look strange, but support your spelling argument.Just like scientific citations.There are a lot of strange things in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Currently, PubMed contains more than 18 million peer-reviewed articles with approximately 40,000-50,000 more added monthly. Navigating this literature is a crazy mess. When we created brainSCANr, our goal was to simplify complex neuroscience data. But now we want to shoot for more.At best, as scientists we have to be highly selective about what studies we cite in our papers because many journals limit our bibliographies to 30-50 references. At worst, we&amp;#39;re very biased and selectively myopic. On the flip side, across these 18+ million PubMed articles, a scientist can probably find at least one peer-reviewed manuscript that supports any given statement no matter how ridiculous. Don&amp;#39;t believe me? Here&amp;#39;s my first whack at a questionable series of statements supported by peer-reviewed literature:Human vision extends into the ultraviolet frequency range1, possibly mediated by an endogenous violet receptor2.Or:The effects of retroactive prayer are well-described in improving patient outcomes1. Herein we examine the hypothesis that such retroactive healing is mediated by an innate human ability for &amp;quot;psi&amp;quot;; that is, for distance healing mediated by well known quantum effects2.What we need is a way to quickly assess the strength of support of a statement, not an authors&amp;#39; biased account of the literature. By changing the way we cite support for our statements within our manuscripts, we can begin to address problems with impact factors, publish or perish, and other scientometric downfalls.brainSCANr is but a first step in what we hope will be a larger project to address what we believe is the core issue with scientific publishing: manuscript citation methods.We argue that, by extending the methods we present in brainSCANr to find relationships between topics, we can adopt an entirely new citation method. Rather than citing only a few articles to support any given statement made in a manuscript, we can create a link to the entire corpus of scientific research that supports that statement. Instead of a superscript number indicating a specific citation within a manuscript, any statement requiring support would be associated with a superscript number that represents the strength of support that statement has based upon the entire literature.For example, &amp;quot;working memory processes are supported by the prefrontal cortex&amp;quot;0.00674, gets strong support, and a link to PubMed showing those articles that support that statement. Another statement, &amp;quot;prefrontal cortex supports breathing&amp;quot;0.00033, also gets a link, but notice how much smaller that number is? It has far less scientific support. (The method for extracting these numbers uses a simple co-occurrence algorithm outlined in the brainSCANr paper).My citation method removes citation biases. It provides the reader a quick indication of how well-supported an argument is. If I&amp;#39;m reading this paper and I see a large number, I might not bother to look it up as the scientific consensus is relatively strong. But if I see an author make a statement with a low number--that is, a weak scientific consensus--then I might want to be a bit more skeptical about what follows.We live in a world where the entirety of scientific knowledge is easily available to us. Why aren&amp;#39;t we leveraging these data in our effort to uncover truth? Why are we limiting ourselves to a method of citations that has not substantially changed since the invention of the book? My method may have flaws, but it much harder to game than the current citation biases that only give us the narrowest slice of scientific support. My citation method entirely shifts the endeavor of science from numbers and rankings of journals and authors (a weak system for science, to say the least!) to a system wherein research is about making statements about truth. Which is what science should be.Thoughts?. (2006). The Impact Factor Game PLoS Medicine, 3 (6) DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030291 (2010).

The International Darwin Day Foundation lists the better part of 100 activities &lt;a href="http://darwinday.org/events/" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, most but not all between February 9 and 12. But if anyone has any pet activities to publicize, please go at it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will start: One of my colleagues tells me that the Iowa City &lt;a href="http://iowacitydarwinday.org/default.aspx" rel="external "&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; on February 11 and 12 will feature two talks by Frans de Waal, one technical, and one general. The general talk is entitled “Morality before Religion: Empathy, Reciprocity and Fairness in our Fellow Primates.”  You may find the entire schedule and location at the link directly above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secular Students and Skeptics Society at the University of Colorado is sponsoring a &lt;a href="http://ssassatcu.blogspot.com/p/darwin-week.html" rel="external "&gt;weeklong event&lt;/a&gt;, February 7-11. On Wednesday, February 9, I will discuss my contention that our sense of morality is an evolved trait; by a not entirely surprising coincidence, de Waal’s work figures into my talk. The no doubt sassy students will also show the movie “Creation” on Monday, February 7, followed by a discussion led by philosophy professor Carol Cleland. Again, you may find the entire schedule and locations at the link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I have so far. I invite anyone else who wants to publicize a specific event to do so in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 26&lt;/strong&gt;: Please see below the fold for an &lt;strong&gt;update &lt;/strong&gt;by Michael Zimmerman of the Huffington Post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will have to get through certain amount of boilerplate, but Michael Zimmerman has an article on the Huffington Post &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-zimmerman/betty-white-and-science-e_b_812762.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in which he suggests writing to various media outlets and asking them to cover Evolution Sunday. Here is his list:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this simple step and make a difference – a difference that can have a lasting effect on our understanding of both religion and science as well as on the very nature of science education for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I write, I plan to direct them to &lt;a href="http://darwinday.org/events/" rel="external "&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://darwinday.org/events/" rel="external "&gt;http://darwinday.org/events/&lt;/a&gt;) and note that countless events are planned all across North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="center" border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/horoscoped/"&gt;&lt;img style="border:1px solid #000000" alt="horoscoped" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/horoscoped.png" height="225" width="265"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A chart showing the most common words used &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in horoscopes on Yahoo.com's horoscope web pages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, believers in Astrology usually repeat the same old tired explanations for the inability of science to confirm astrological predictions. These include a lack of scientific equipment or theory capable of measuring or understanding the mystery of astrology, and of course simple lack of belief. As former JREF President and Bad Astronomer Phil Plait has pointed out many a time and in great detail: “Astrology is wrong.” Seriously, if you want to know why Astrology and Horoscopes can’t possibly make any sense, read Phil’s take on it &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; at his Bad Astronomy website (&lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/"&gt;www.badastronomy.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I bring this up is that a fine chap named David McCandless &lt;a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/horoscoped/"&gt;recently analyzed 22,168 horoscopes&lt;/a&gt; from the Yahoo.com astrology website in an effort to see if there was any correlation between the sorts of words that most commonly appear in horoscopes. After filtering out words like ‘the’, ‘and’ and the like, McCandless discovered that no matter what sign a person may be, and no matter what type of horoscope a person may be reading, the words that appear are pretty much identical with over a 90% match between signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even isolated the most common words and wrote a generic meta-prediction that applies to all of the star signs for every day of the year. Here is what they came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:comic sans ms,sans-serif"&gt;“Whatever the situation or secret moment, enjoy everything a lot. Feel able to absolutely care. Expect nothing else. Keep making love. Family and friends matter. The world is life, fun and energy. Maybe hard. Or easy. Taking exactly enough is best. Help and talk to others. Change your mind and a better mood comes along…” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, reading that has just changed my life; specifically in that the 30 seconds I spent reading it is time that I can never get back.  We need to take our hats off to folks like David who go to the trouble of exposing Astrology for what it really is, and the resulting graphic that his team came up with to show the most common words is actually sort of pleasing to the eyes.

First days of classes are always challenging since students will try to push boundaries as quickly as possible and set the bar where they want it. I'm generally pretty good at curbing that, but today my new 11th graders pulled a rather dirty trick that's going to mess me up for a good long time now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The class is only 6 students and before class, they all met, organized, and traded names. Only after 20 minutes of using the wrong names, I asked a student to remind me of her name and she slipped, giving me her real name, which had previously been associated with a different student which is when I caught on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very sneaky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I'm going to like this class.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-3305613710462992494?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295909051097"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=15218">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3dcbac35f9bf171b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Culture"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Media and Science"/><category term="Science Workforce"/><category term="Sexed Up Science"/><title type="html">Bad Project</title><published>2011-01-24T22:43:12Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T22:43:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DiscoverIntersection/~3/YNW4eHNEJws/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/24/bad-project/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already caught &lt;em&gt;Bad Project&lt;/em&gt; by Zheng Lab, watch this and compare to the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrO4YZeyl0I"&gt;original fabulous video&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bad Romance&lt;/em&gt; by Lady Gaga (&lt;em&gt;produced by my brilliant cousin Nicole Ehrlich).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Enter &amp;quot;Le Packing&amp;quot;, which is the target of an unprecedented consensus statement just out from a list of 18 big-name autism experts (available free here).This alleged therapy consists of wrapping the patient (wearing only underclothes or naked in the case of young children) several times a week during weeks or months in towels soaked in cold water (10°C to 15°C). The individual is wrapped with blankets to help the body warm up in a process lasting 45 minutes, during which time the child or adolescent is accompanied by two to four staff persons.The alleged goal of this technique is to “allow the child to rid him- or herself progressively of its pathological defense mechanisms against archaic anxieties,” by achieving “a greater perception and integration of the body, and a growing sense of containment.”No, really. Frankly, they could have stopped there, because the description is condemnation enough, but they go on to write:We have reached the consensus that practitioners and families around the world should consider this approach unethical. Furthermore, this “therapy” ignores current knowledge about autism spectrum disorders; goes against evidence-based practice...and, in our view, poses a risk of preventing these children and adolescents from accessing their basic human rights to health and education.Le Packing, as the name suggests, originated in France, and its use seems to be confined to France and other French-speaking areas. This is the first I&amp;#39;d ever heard of it. Little has been written about it in English (though see this long article and this piece from 2007) so here&amp;#39;s my loose translation of the the article on the French Wikipedia:Packing is used in children with autism, but also in others: psychotic adults (specifically when they&amp;#39;re recovering from an acute psychotic episode), in the elderly, etc.It&amp;#39;s intended to restore &amp;quot;awareness of the body image&amp;quot;.It&amp;#39;s extremely controversial. Well, duh.The technique was invented, in France, by a &amp;quot;controversial American psychiatrist&amp;quot; called M. A. Woodburry. It was intended for the treatment of severely autistic children and adolescents, especially those with severe behavioural problems such as self-harm, aggression, and refusal to eat.The patient is wrapped in towels covered in cold water: two towels for the torso, and one for each arm and leg. They&amp;#39;re then additionally wrapped in a sheet and then blankets, over the towels. The cold water quickly warms up thanks to body heat: the child is never actually hypothermic.After this session, the child is &amp;quot;frictionné&amp;quot; (I guess this means massaged) and taken to their living quarters and offered a snack &amp;quot;in a friendly atmosphere&amp;quot;.Le Packing is intended to recover a physical sense of their own body. It should be used as part of a wider package of care, and only with the consent of the patient&amp;#39;s parents.The cold water is optional; some, e.g. a Dr A. Gillis, use warm water nowadays. The key point is the restraint, i.e. the fact that their attempts to move their body are restricted temporarily. Hence &amp;quot;le packing&amp;quot;, huh.The scientific status of Le Packing is controversial. A group called &amp;quot;Léa pour Samy&amp;quot; say it should be banned, and replaced by the (much more orthodox) method of ABA. However, in 2007, authorities approved a randomized controlled trial led by a &amp;quot;Dr Goeb&amp;quot; of the CHU hospital in Lille.Critics accuse Le Packing of being an unethical, inhuman and degrading treatment, maybe even torture. There are allegations of cases in which the towels were much colder than 10°C, e.g. straight out of the freezer.There are also allegations of its use without parental consent. A Professor Pierre Delion, of the CHU in Lille, reportedly defended this in remarks to The Lancet &amp;quot;if a child is in danger following a road accident, you do not wait for the parents&amp;#39; agreement to give him a transfusion.&amp;quot; But this is actually a misquote. In the Lancet piece, he was referring to the patient&amp;#39;s consent and said parental consent was always sought.In 2009 a government minister told the French Senate that Le Packing should only be used under strictly controlled conditions according to a protocol - but others, e.g. the &amp;quot;Léa pour Samy&amp;quot; group, want it banned altogether.This rather speaks for itself, but I&amp;#39;ll say this. If someone is suffering these kinds of severe behavioural disturbances, the temptation to do something dramatic must be intense. Indeed, if someone&amp;#39;s disturbed to the point of trying to mutilate themselves, or refusing to eat, almost by definition you&amp;#39;re going to have to restrain them, either physically or with sedatives, temporarily. While Le Packing may be a French peculiarity, it&amp;#39;s not like psychiatrists in other countries never resort to drastic measures.Amaral D, Rogers SJ, Baron-Cohen S, Bourgeron T, Caffo E, Fombonne E, Fuentes J, Howlin P, Rutter M, Klin A, Volkmar F, Lord C, Minshew N, Nardocci F, Rizzolatti G, Russo S, Scifo R, &amp;amp; van der Gaag RJ (2011).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engrish.com/2011/01/even-the-dog-is-hot/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/hot-family-photo.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seldom does one encounter so many delectable Chinglishisms in such small space.  Furthermore, several of the items, especially the last, are both rare and challenging, so I take particular delight in explaining how they came about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Starting at the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the dish is &lt;em&gt;málà quánjiāfú&lt;/em&gt; 麻辣全家福.  &lt;em&gt;Málà&lt;/em&gt; 麻辣 is often rendered as "spicy," but it more specifically refers to the "numbing" effect of Szechwan peppercorn and the "hot" quality of chili peppers.  &lt;em&gt;Quánjiāfú&lt;/em&gt; 全家福, literally "whole family welfare / blessing / happiness / good fortune," is a colloquial term referring either to a "portrait of a whole family" or something quite different, "a hodgepodge."  Unfortunately, the person who drew up this menu made the wrong choice between the two meanings.  The correct translation should be something like "Spicy Combo," not "Hot family photo."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;yuánliào&lt;/em&gt; 原料 should be "ingredients," not "stuff"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;zhǎngzhōng bǎo&lt;/em&gt; 掌中寶 literally, "treasure in the palm"; depending on the context, this could means lots of different things (e.g., certain portable electronic devices go by this name), but in recipes it usually signifies the cartilage or gristle of chicken claws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hǎixiā&lt;/em&gt; 海蝦 "sea lobster," not "crayfish"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;bāzhuǎyú&lt;/em&gt; 八爪魚 literally, "eight claw fish," but referring to "octopus"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;jīchì&lt;/em&gt; 雞翅 this is pretty hard to mess up:  literally, "chicken wing"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;niúròu wán&lt;/em&gt; 牛肉丸 this one is also difficult to get wrong:  literally, "beef meat ball."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, that's the end of the ingredients.  Now we move on to&lt;em&gt; pēngtiáo&lt;/em&gt; 烹調, which refers to how all the above will be cooked, and that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;zhà&lt;/em&gt; 炸 means to "scald in hot oil or water"; unfortunately, because it also enters into the word for "explode," viz., &lt;em&gt;bàozhà&lt;/em&gt; 爆炸, it often gets mistranslated on Chinese menus and in Chinese cookbooks as "explode," which is not exactly what one wants to happen while cooking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;chǎo&lt;/em&gt; 炒 is "stir fry," the usual way to cook most vegetables and meats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough for the cooking process.  What about the results?  Well, the menu informs us that the &lt;em&gt;wèixíng&lt;/em&gt; 味型 ("flavor type"), what is rendered on it as "taste," is  "Kim Possible."  A Google search for "麻辣" + "Kim Possible" yielded a fairly large number of occurrences of  "麻辣女孩 Kim Possible OP," where the "OP" could appear at various places in the string of characters and letters, or even separated from the string.  I guessed that "&lt;em&gt;málà&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;nǚhái&lt;/em&gt; 麻辣女孩 Kim Possible&amp;quot; must mean &amp;quot;Spicy Girl Kim Possible&amp;quot; (not &amp;quot;Spice Girl Kim Possible&amp;quot;!) — Kim Possible being a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Possible"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/kimpossible/"&gt;Disney cartoon character&lt;/a&gt;. The chat rooms are full of youths who confess to being in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was still confused about what the "OP" stood for, so I had to ask my students, and they immediately informed me that "OP" means the opening theme song for an anime show; it contrasts with ED, which means the ending theme song that is played at the conclusion of each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kim Possible theme in Chinese can be found &lt;a href="http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/aIhq-fa55mI/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; or in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAFQlFN71T4"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/yAFQlFN71T4?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor should we forget Kim Possible's friend &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU93bZvmtVA"&gt;Ron Stoppable&lt;/a&gt;, and his naked mole rat Rufus, though they have yet to be documented on a Beijing menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXTl9Gbk5Y"&gt;Danish, even&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Possible is indeed a spicy girl, so that is how this inimitable "Hot family photo" got its "Kim Possible" taste.&lt;/p&gt;

As bad as that was, it got worse when The Huffington Post weighed in, adding their own nonsense to the story, misattributing parts of the story and making even more faulty connections to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story went viral rapidly. Other media venues quickly picked up on it, furthering the nonsense without doing any independent investigation of it. Happily, not everyone got it wrong; I’ll note that the first venue that apparently got it right was &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/01/21/betelgeuse-explode-scientists-say/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, who linked to an earlier article I wrote about Betelgeuse.&lt;/p&gt;

From time to time, I’ll be posting a segment of these so you guys can share some of the random hilarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, our discussion was around the &lt;a href="http://on.msnbc.com/f3AJDs"&gt;mysterious disappearing OB tampons reported here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elyse:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF?!? People don’t work this hard to get heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“this is like taking my right to breathe”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello whut. Because buying a particular brand of tampon is a basic human right, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elyse:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that time in high school when you got your period early and  didn’t have any o.b. in your purse so you spent the day stuffing paper  towels in your pants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you know what Darfur is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Tracy with no e, not a basic human right … A BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, I use o.b. tampons, and have not noticed the disappearance.   I assume this is due to my need to have what my family calls “the Cold  War Stash” of supplies under the bathroom sink.  Does it qualify as  hoarding if it’s less than 10 of each item?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elyse: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use(d?) ob. But I didn’t notice because  if you have a baby you don’t get a period until god declares you pure  again. So the last time I bought a box of huge ass absorbency obs, it  was almost two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I still find those fuckers everywhere I go. Like goddamn Legos and  Lite Brite bulbs. They live in the crevices of my floorboards. In my  car. In my pockets.  I think I even gave 40 to Amy last year. AND  THEY’RE STILL EVERYWHERE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact I just found 12 that were actually in my vagina. In their wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hahahahah! It’s true! I keep finding the ones you gave me and I have even moved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t like non-applicator tampons, but I get cross by Tampax Pearl, which has a super-smooth plastic applicator “like pearls”. Ridiculous waste of resources. That said, I got a free one with a regular pack&lt;br&gt;
and it did slide in like a lubed cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I’ve ever lubed a cucumber, you understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn’t I have a behind the scenes at skepchick feature at one point? Where I posted emails? Can I post this? I am dying here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then everyone will know I don’t lube my cucumber!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that supposed to be news, Tracy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I still needed tampons, I’d cut a bitch to get some OBs during a shortage. Those little bastards are the only ones that didn’t feel like dry cotton finger of Satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heheh Satan is a huge evil red leathery dude with slim white cotton fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HEY WAIT WHADDYA MEAN NEWS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*mutter grumble vagina complain*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elyse:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Tampon Hands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elyse:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not believe in God — any god. I strive to be a good atheist and person by setting an example of decency to all and service to my community. The whole “good without god” thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In raising my 6 and 7 year old sons, I’ve always responded to the rare god/heaven/religion questions with “That’s what &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people believe, but lots of people including me don’t.” That’s always felt like a clever answer, and been easy in the abstract, and I pride myself on not lying to or indoctrinating them with bogus beliefs I don’t share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my mom is dying…soon. She’s been given “weeks to months” to live. I’ve got my own grieving to do, but better and lesser people than me have gotten through it, and so will I. (said through tears, lest you think I’m a cold-hearted bastard) She’s religious (LDS) and completely confident she’s queued up for an afterlife, but I see it as saying goodbye forever. (yes, she’ll live on in our memories and how we honor her with service, etc., but still…dead is gone, it’s not the same.) I’m already planning on shrugging my way through the countless “she’s in a better place” references, but what about my boys for whom the question/statement will guide their impressions of what happened to grandma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing this very real situation I find myself debating the advantages/drawbacks of letting them believe the myth that grandma’s looking down on them from heaven to help them cope/grieve. I sure won’t be the one telling them that, but they’re gonna hear it from left and right, and when they ask me about it I think I’m going to bite my tongue and say something “Yup!” or more likely something less certain that still doesn’t amount to outright rejection. “I dunno buddy, maybe, I sure hope so!” I’m thinking of it like Santa Claus and the stockings — a short term lie/myth that I ignore/perpetuate until they’re old enough to consider the facts/faith and decide for themselves how they want to think about their grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net-net, I want to be a good parent and do what I can to make the loss of their grandmother as easy as possible for my boys, but I also want to stand by my beliefs, even as they are put to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
- Neil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Neil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, please accept my heartfelt wishes for your mother’s comfort in her illness and for your comfort in your grief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you’re an excellent father because you’re giving your sons respect, and you’re demonstrating integrity. You’re clearly not a “cold-hearted bastard,” and you don’t have to choose between that extreme or the other extreme of supporting feel-good fairytales. I think you should continue to be consistently honest with your boys even now when it might be tempting to “kid” your kids. This is where respect and integrity will be the most important; when it is about real people and events, and not just in the abstract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most precious gift you are giving them, the most important role you are playing as a parent is being the man who always tells them the truth &lt;em&gt;as he sees it.&lt;/em&gt;  As small children, they naturally come to you for answers to their questions. But as they grow, they will continue to come to you only if you consistently demonstrate for them the difference between truth and honesty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, people who fancy that they possess the truth, especially when they spell it with a capital “T”, lose track of being honest. With your sons, you are being honest about what you’re sure of, honest about what you think might be so, and honest about what you just don’t know. If they imitate and adopt that kind of integrity, it will serve them well their whole lives. Don’t discard that in a futile attempt to spare them sadness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadness is an important and inevitable part of life, and trying in vain  to “protect” them from it with fantasies will only cause problems later. It does not “help them to cope and grieve,” it only postpones their coping and grieving until they are not as good at learning to cope with feelings, and they’re better practiced at &lt;em&gt;avoiding&lt;/em&gt; feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each stage of their development, children become more capable of understanding concepts such as death, and their emotions will be equal to their current level of understanding. At the age of your two sons, most children have just begun to realize that dead things don’t come back, but it is still mostly abstract and distant when applied to themselves and other people. So children feel a child’s level of grief, and adults feel an adult’s level of grief.  Supported by your caring attention, they are not likely to be devastated by their feelings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of trying to protect them from their feelings, provide them reassurance that they do not have to endure their feelings &lt;em&gt;alone.&lt;/em&gt; The most injurious experience of childhood is not sadness and grief; it is abandonment or the threat of abandonment, being left to cope on their own. Don’t worry,  refraining from confirming the reassuring stories they may hear from their relatives does not have to mean coldly abandoning them to emotionally fend for themselves. Instead, it is respecting and validating the reality of their emotions, and reaffirming that you are there to walk through it all with them in the here and now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comfort them with your &lt;em&gt;company&lt;/em&gt; instead of with wishful thinking. Be an open ear to their feelings, but also respect their need to quietly brood for a while. Also just as importantly, let them comfort &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; if they wish. Helping to soothe someone soothes the helper as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sons will not just be listening to your words, they will also be watching your reactions to the events playing out. Even though they will have their own level of feelings, they will be learning how to handle their feelings in the future by watching how you handle yours.  Do not try to hide your sadness from them, afraid that you will be adding to their burden. Let them see that it is not only okay to express feelings, it’s &lt;em&gt;important,&lt;/em&gt; and that doing so in the company of your loved ones is the best way. As the old proverb says, &lt;em&gt;“A grief shared is half a grief, and a joy shared is twice a joy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time during and shortly after the memorial service or funeral will be hectic and filled with people with all sorts of beliefs. Some of them will not stop for a moment to consider what your wishes might be when they express their beliefs to your boys.  So it might be helpful to prepare your boys shortly ahead of time. Let them know that some people will probably tell them that “Grandma’s in a better place,” or that “You’ll all be together again in heaven,” and similar things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell them that this is how many people help themselves feel better, and they’re trying to help the boys feel better too. Encourage them to ask you about such things just as they have in the past. Let your basic honest response be as you have consistently done: “Well buddy, lots of folks believe that stuff, and lots of folks do not. I don’t, but nobody really knows.  What I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know for certain is that I miss her a lot and I love you a lot.”  Then offer them those things you mentioned about remembering her and honoring her by copying the best of her example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil, as you said, you have your own grieving to do. Be sure to attend to your own grief with as much permission and latitude as you give to your children. Don’t let the idea of protecting them from grief actually be an attempt to vicariously protect yourself from your own, and don’t distract yourself from your own feelings by focusing exclusively on theirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grief comes in waves. Large and rapid at first, gradually diminishing in intensity, length and frequency. Whenever one comes on, stop whatever you’re doing and let it have its say in your mind without distraction or interference. Express your feelings just as they are, and in its time the wave will pass. Just as you have done for your kids, give yourself the company of loving adults, and give yourself some time alone as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend that you buy and keep two excellent books by Dale McGowan, &lt;em&gt;Parenting Beyond Belief&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Raising Freethinkers.&lt;/em&gt; Both have very insightful and practical chapters on talking to children about death.  Read those chapters, and after this difficult time has passed, read the rest of both books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever and whenever you learn a good thing to do for your children, remember it also applies to you.  You’re already doing a very good job nurturing your boys, and you can expand that same wisdom to include nurturing yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click to Hephaestenate and get the stunning full-res shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a magnificent photograph! The south (left) side of Onekotan is a collapsed caldera; magma filled a gigantic chamber underneath the cone, building up enormous pressure, until one day it exploded. Once the chamber emptied the mountain above and around it collapsed down, leaving that huge depression 7.5 km (4.6 miles) wide. Eventually water filled the bowl, forming the Kal’tsevoe Lake, and a new volcanic stratovolcano, Krenitzyn Peak, built up in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side (north or right) is the smaller lake Chernoe, the remnants of a caldera that’s millennia old. Nemo peak is a new volcano forming there in the ashes of the old. The entire island is about 43 km (26 miles) long, with Krenitzyn topping out at 1350 meters, and Nemo at just over 1000. It’s part of the Kuril chain of volcanic islands that stretch north of Japan ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/3i00hd7iomquf4dkhramao81dk/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fbadastronomy%2F2011%2F01%2F24%2Ffire-and-ice%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~4/tH3t3yOGL6g" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295899299379"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/how_often_are_the_mars_space_r.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a633ae8c1e663b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Mars"/><title type="html">How often are the Mars space robots out of contact with the Earth?</title><published>2011-01-24T19:59:59Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T19:59:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/a0R1uZ2H9nQ/how_often_are_the_mars_space_r.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/how_often_are_the_mars_space_r.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A question came up in the comments on the post &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/mars_will_pass_behind_sun_rove.php"&gt;Mars will pass behind sun, Rover operations affected&lt;/a&gt;, and the answer turns out to be very interesting.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/how_often_are_the_mars_space_r.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/how_often_are_the_mars_space_r.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/a0R1uZ2H9nQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295896941481"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8285737581949527996.post-2506426340660467064">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf413bfa3866793a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Is low dose citalopram as effective as other antidepressants?</title><published>2011-01-24T19:18:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T19:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pyjamasinbananas.blogspot.com/2011/01/is-low-dose-citalopram-as-effective-as.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>pj</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295896810747"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/see_exercise_will_kill_you.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc19071c4ee2d42b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="News"/><title type="html">See?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a short survey about how your sexuality has developed over time and how it has changed in relation to your lack of belief in a god. The research is being conducted by Dr. Darrel Ray, author of The God Virus and Amanda Brown at the University of Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This survey is for ATHEISTS, AGNOSTICS, SPIRITUALISTS, HUMANISTS, and SECULARISTS. We need to have people who do not believe in a deity, or organized religion, of any sort.

&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and filled it out, but I&amp;#39;m afraid mine was rather boring.

How can thermophilic bacteria not only survive, but actually proliferate, at elevated temperatures that would be lethal to all other forms of life? After extensive research during the past five decades, this question has been answered in a general way, but the molecular basis for this unusual capability has not been clearly resolved. Thermophiles [I use this term to include both thermophiles (optimal growth temperatures of 50-70 °C) and hyperthermophiles (optimal growth temperatures &amp;gt;80 °C)] synthesize intrinsically thermostable cellular components and/or extrinsic stabilizing factors (chaperonins and polyamines, for example).

Most proteins isolated from thermophiles are thermostable and the mechanisms underlying this property have been extensively studied. These investigations have their roots in the pioneering work on the heat stability of hemoglobin and ferredoxin carried out by Perutz in 1975. Some of the strategies reported to bring about protein thermostability include higher levels of charged amino acids on the protein surface that promote ionic interactions, amino acid preferences, hydrophobic cores, aliphatic side chains, disulfide bridges, and solute accumulation. It is obvious from these studies that a universal mechanism to achieve protein thermostability does not exist. The complexity of this problem is highlighted by differences that appear to be in play for multimeric proteins versus single polypeptide chains, for soluble proteins versus membrane proteins, and for proteins from thermophiles versus proteins from hyperthermophiles....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s your strategy, you may end up a teetotaller, &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/will-state-union-address-state-planet"&gt;as I point out at DeSmogBlog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2011/01/23/obama-climate-change-global-warming-state-of-the-union-address/"&gt;As Joe Romm notes&lt;/a&gt;, even those pre-speech analysts who do intimately understand the climate issue (and most do not) want the president to talk about energy innovation, not how much of a risk we’re running from ongoing warming. And at a time when the unswerving focus is the economy and jobs, and the president has just named the CEO of a clean energy company, General Electric, to head his new Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, you have to figure they’re on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, even in the last State of the Union Obama only mentioned climate change twice. And he only did so to quickly reframe it as a clean energy issue…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a bad thing? Not, as I argue, if you’re a sheer political realist. &lt;/p&gt;

But this &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=414868&amp;amp;c=2"&gt;awful little article&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Ormell in &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; merits an exception.   It has been ably demolished &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/life-and-physics/2011/jan/22/1?CMP=twt_gu"&gt;Jon Butterworth at the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, but is worth revisiting, because its badness illuminates a larger point.   (Via &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/astroparticle/status/28784864144654336"&gt;@astroparticle&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ormell’s thesis is laid out at the start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematics tends to be both misunderstood and credited with magic powers, especially by those who are intelligent but not mathematically inclined. Arising from this, there is a perennial temptation for mathematicians to play to the gallery and to assume the role of magicians and, even more temptingly, high priests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worrisome sign here is not the explicit content, which is vague enough to be unobjectionable, but the gleeful indulgence in overgeneralization.  It seems clear that what we are in for is a broad denunciation of mathematicians and their ilk, not a nuanced appreciation.  The devil will be in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have seen blind faith in mathematics in action recently. In addition to the contribution of mathematical models to the great credit crunch of 2008, take physicist Stephen Hawking’s claim that philosophy is dead. The reason he gave was that philosophers have stopped bothering trying to understand modern mathematical cosmology. This cosmology is based on current mathematical physics, most of which has been in place for less than 100 years. It is an impressive edifice of concepts and mathematical models, but one that has not yet built up a track record for reliability over a thousand years, let alone a million years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking’s claim that philosophy is dead was silly, but not nearly as silly as this.  I’m not sure what the implication is supposed to be — we shouldn’t trust sciences that don’t have a thousand-year track record of reliability?  Since that includes almost all of contemporary science except for a bit of astronomy, we’d be living in primitive circumstances indeed.  The “million years” criterion is even more awesome.  That means we shouldn’t trust things like “writing,” or for that matter “human beings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1900, various theorists wondered whether the velocity of light might be slowly changing. It was a pertinent question. If the velocity of light was changing very slowly, many of our astronomical calculations would have to go into the bin. Perhaps the gravitational constant might be slowly changing: that, too, would throw our calculations out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what Ormell is talking about here.  I suppose it’s possible that there were people around 1900 who were questioning the constancy of the speed of light; I don’t know all of the relevant history.  But certainly the famous part of the story was that people were looking for direction-dependent differences in the speed of light due to our motion through the aether, not a slow secular change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead it was discovered that light does not travel in absolutely straight lines, but bends slightly due to the Earth’s gravitation. It is a minute effect and detectable only with great difficulty, but its consequences are deadly.  If this degree of bending occurred in outer space, the light from the nearest star would have completed a circular trajectory on its way from its source to our telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some truth here, wrapped in the colorful garments of severe misunderstanding.  Yes, light does not travel in absolutely straight lines.  But this has nothing to do with its speed, only its direction.  And it wasn’t simply “discovered”; it was first predicted by Einstein, and then verified by Eddington and others.  (All of whom used math, by the way.)  Its consequences are certainly not deadly.  The bending is caused by gravity, which is not uniform through space, so the business about circular trajectories is just some earnest babbling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, but, but…we all tend to be quite sure that this is only fanciful thinking. Of course light travels in straight lines in outer space! We all have a degree of blind faith in mathematics. We have no reason to believe that merely travelling through space will cause light to bend, though the presence of dark matter in space would have a bending effect if that matter were not absolutely uniformly distributed. (As we know almost nothing about dark matter, it is a material assumption to suppose that it is absolutely uniformly distributed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything here is entertainingly wrong.  Nobody who understands the subject believes this is fanciful thinking; we’re quite convinced of the reality of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens"&gt;gravitational lensing&lt;/a&gt;.  That is because of, not despite, our knowledge of mathematics.  And dark matter is certainly not uniformly distributed; if it were, we wouldn’t have been able to find it in galaxies and clusters.  Its non-uniformness is kind of the point.  It’s very hard to tell what he is even trying to say here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we reach the culmination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So were the values of &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; – the speed of light and the gravitational constant – the same a million years ago as they are today? It must surely stick in the throat to say that we are quite sure about this. At one time people thought that the magnetic poles were absolutely fixed. Now we know that they are on the move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes.  “Once some people were wrong about something, so there’s no reason to believe anything.”  One of my favorite arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s admit that there is a minute element of doubt here, say 1 per cent. If so, we can be 99 per cent sure that these physical constants were the same 1,000,000 years ago as they are today. If we follow logic – and being blindly sure that the mathematics is right should hardly incline us to reject logic – then we can be only (0.99)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x 100 per cent sure that these constants were the same 2,000,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And (0.99)&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; x 100 per cent sure that they were the same 100,000,000 years ago. This is 36.6 per cent, a reasonable figure perhaps, given that 100,000,000 years ago was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmologists assure us that the Big Bang happened 13.7 billion years ago, that is, 13,700 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the figure for the degree to which we can be sure that the constants &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; were the same then? Clearly it is (0.99)&lt;sup&gt;13,700&lt;/sup&gt; x 100 per cent, which comes out as 1.59 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-58&lt;/sup&gt; per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hardly knows where to begin.  We could point out that dimensionful quantities like &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; can’t really change on their own, only with respect to some other dimensionful quantities — only dimensionless ratios are observable.  But physicists often speak this way out of laziness, so we will cut Ormell some slack.  Obviously there is no reason to attach at 1 percent uncertainty to the value of &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; a million years ago — that was pulled out of some orifice or another.  The assumption that such an uncertainty can be independently assigned to every million-year period in the history of the universe is so woefully wrong that the feelings it conjures are closer to compassion than annoyance.  (Don’t skip over “being blindly sure that the mathematics is right should hardly incline us to reject logic.”  That’s a rare gem; treasure it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real point is this:  after pushing around these nonsensical numbers, Ornell concludes with a flourish that we have essentially zero reason to believe that Newton’s constant of gravitation had the same value in the early universe that it has today.  Put aside for the moment the question of whether this is “right” or “wrong.”  The thing I want to highlight is:  does he really believe this is something professional physicists have never thought of?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the irksome bit.  I am a firm believer that this is everyone’s universe, and every person has an equal right to think and theorize about it, regardless of their credentials or education.  But when you are tempted to take those musings seriously — enough to write them up in an essay and present the results proudly in &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; — a reality check is in order.  Scientists aren’t right about everything (far from it), but they do spend a lot of time thinking about these things.  In order for them to have never considered a possibility like this, the whole lot of them would have to be in the grips of an extremely anti-scientific blindness to alternative possibilities.  Which I suppose is Ormell’s thesis, but he is only proving that he believes it, not that it is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody is harder on scientific theories than scientists are.  That’s what we do.  You don’t become a successful scientist by licking the metaphorical boots of Einstein or Darwin or Newton; you hit the jackpot by pushing them off their pedestals.  Every one of us would love to discover that all of our best theories are wrong, either by doing an astonishing experiment or coming up with an unexpectedly clever theory.  The reason why we have the right to put some degree of confidence in well-established models is that such a model must have survived decades of impolite prodding and skeptical critiques by hundreds of experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioning whether Newton’s constant &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; is really constant (with respect to some other measurable quantities) is an old game, going back at least to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_large_numbers_hypothesis"&gt;Paul Dirac&lt;/a&gt;.  Many contemporary cosmologists have used data from the early universe to constrain any such variation — I’ve even &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108002"&gt;dabbled in it myself&lt;/a&gt;.  The answer is that the value of &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; one minute after the Big Bang is within ten percent of its value today.  That’s from data, not theory; if it weren’t true, the expansion rate of the universe during &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis"&gt;primordial nucleosynthesis&lt;/a&gt; would have been different, and we wouldn’t correctly predict the abundance of helium that we observe in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of which is this:  if your thesis requires that generations of scientists have completely missed some idea that, when you sit and think about it, is really pretty frikkin’ obvious — maybe you should do a little homework before using it as a jumping-off point for a rant about the intellectual shortcomings of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ormell goes on to say more silly things.  Apparently he has demonstrated that Goedel’s theorem undermines Cantor’s discovery of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number"&gt;transfinite numbers&lt;/a&gt;.  I’m sure the mathematics journals are eagerly awaiting his upcoming papers on this important result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony here is that Ormell is trying to teach us two lessons:  we need better mathematics education, and we should be less arrogant.  Those are indeed good lessons to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve been sabotaging science, history, and social studies, and doing a pretty thorough job of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the helm for most of that time was Don McLeroy, an avowed young-Earth creationist who has been tireless in trying to insert his own narrow view of the world into the Texas textbooks. And this is no local problem; the books Texas chooses can affect other states as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by Vijay Dewan, who is working on a documentary about this. He and his team have 200 hours of footage, and they’re looking for funding to get a good editor for it.  To do this, they’ve got &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/OrlandoWood/standing-up-to-the-experts?ref=city"&gt;a Kick Starter campaign&lt;/a&gt; set up to raise the money to complete the documentary. They’ve put together a trailer video which you can see on the Kick Starter site, and you can watch here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will come two days after President Obama’s State of the Union Address. With economic recovery limping along and war ongoing in Iraq and Afghanistan, health care reform is likely to play a pivotal role when the president lists his administration’s accomplishments during Tuesday’s address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; articles over the weekend, “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/fashion/23THISLIFE.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=modern%20family&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;What ‘Modern Family’ Says About Modern Families&lt;/a&gt;,” contemplates why the hodgepodge families depicted on one of television’s most popular shows are so well-loved. The author suggests that fans connect to the show’s portrayal of our (sometimes dysfunctional) relationship with technology and media; that the characters’ confessional interviews with the camera reflect our own running monologues, updated regularly on Twitter and Facebook. But in conclusion, the article suggests that many of us love the Pritchett-Thacker family so much because under the surface of their oddball characters, technologically-advanced snafus, and unconventional relationships, they’re acting out the very traditional family values that even we modern viewers crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the weekend’s more interesting articles was an infographic made by the Pew Research Center and hosted on GOOD’s website: “&lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/infographic-the-new-american-family/"&gt;The Decline of Marriage and Rise of New Families&lt;/a&gt;” (above). The infographic is a snapshot of how marriage and family have changed between 1960 and 2008, as well as public attitudes about the transformation of the American household. Not surprisingly, less people are married, more people are divorced, and more children are living in households that don’t include both Mom and Dad. As the soaring popularity of &lt;em&gt;Modern Family&lt;/em&gt; suggests, the infographic also says that most of us view the growing diversity of family arrangements in a positive light, or don’t care at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some still lament the fact that so many children now come from “broken homes,” but this weekend’s articles suggest that, for the most part, Americans are getting over their family issues. Whether your family looks like the same-sex couple (Cameron and Mitchell) raising their adopted daughter (Lily), or the remarried grandfather (Jay) raising his much-younger wife’s (Gloria) son (Manny) — most Americans are starting to admit: It’s normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a little reminder of why you should care about recycling plastic and buying from companies that don’t dump in the ocean, check out this photo of the view from inside a wave, taken on the coast of Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photographer, Clark Little, told MSNBC’s &lt;a href="http://photoblog.msnbc.msn.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photoblog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his experience capturing the photograph: “A half-second after this shot was made; the wave hit me straight on,  knocking the camera out of my hand and pulling me into the spinning mass  of air and water. I enjoy the power and beauty of the thick bombs that  roll through and can usually capture some of those moments without  getting slammed. Well, most of the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who don’t live near an ocean that inspires eco-friendly behavior, Clark’s photo is a good reminder of why we put all that effort into trading reusable bags for plastic, and lugging around our own water bottles, instead of buying Fiji water every time we’re thirsty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/24/are-birthers-crazy/#comment-87627"&gt;When pressed in these comments,&lt;/a&gt; Mooney simply denies that unsupported birther claims have anything to do with unsupported Jebus claims, and takes the opportunity to once again flog &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America. &lt;/em&gt;He also pulls a Fermat, saying, “I have a marvelous answer, but the margins of my computer screen are too small to contain it.”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone for the comments, but I must say, I’m a bit dazed by this thread…it just never occurred to me that we’d have a birther/totality of religion analogy. To address the questions being raised under this heading would be tantamount to redebating all the issues that were debated after Unscientific America came out in 2009…e.g., mega time consuming, and probably not productive, I’m afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but evidence is evidence, and what’s good for the birthers is good for the faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would not have thought this possible in the fractious blogosphere, but I’m pretty sure that the decline in readership at &lt;em&gt;The Intersection &lt;/em&gt;mirrors its readers’ recognition that there’s little intellectual integrity—but a lot of self promotion—to be found at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/24/are-birthers-crazy/"&gt;At the &lt;em&gt;Intersection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Mooney discusses—and agrees with—House Majority leader Eric Cantor’s stand that Obama’s citizenship is a stupid issue that should be dropped. Mooney says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m growing increasingly convinced that outside of true mental illness, people believing weird things–or even being in denial about certain facts–is not craziness or insanity. Rather, it’s very normal, even if often lamentable. It’s human nature to convince yourself of things that humor your prior beliefs. In this case, the prior belief is a certain strain of Obama hatred, but it could be pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why Cantor’s stand is important–because as Brendan Nyhan explained on Point of Inquiry, the more we see a uniform rejection of birther claims across the punditariat and political world, and especially on the Republican side, the more they will become simply untenable. At that point, many birthers will still cling to their beliefs–but their wrongheaded view, much like the view that cigarettes don’t cause lung cancer, will no longer trouble serious discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree!  But isn’t there &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; set of beliefs that is just as untenable, but even more harmful, than the claim that Obama is an alien? And shouldn’t we start uniformly rejecting &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; claims, too, knowing that that strategy will eventually purge them from serious discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refer to religion, of course, which Mooney thinks should not be rejected, but respectfully engaged. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see Mooney also call religious belief “untenable” and “wrongheaded,” but I’m not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/"&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/a&gt;, based on a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is a science fiction film about children that are bred for the sole purpose of organ donation. The children attend what appears to be a boarding school called Hailsham, where they are told that health is of the utmost importance because their lives have a very special purpose. It is slowly revealed to them what that “special purpose” is. The story is built around three of the children who are embroiled in a sort of love triangle, which has a uniquely bittersweet feel given that their lives will be so short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/MV5BMTM3NDQ1MjE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNTk2Mw@@._V1._SX214_CR00214314_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="MV5BMTM3NDQ1MjE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNTk2Mw@@._V1._SX214_CR0,0,214,314_" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/MV5BMTM3NDQ1MjE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNTk2Mw@@._V1._SX214_CR00214314_1-204x300.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The film stops short of soapbox bioethics. There’s no cautionary tale about the dangers of scientific progress, or allusion to real-world dilemmas like the story of &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=5490111&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Marissa Ayala&lt;/a&gt;, a child that was conceived for the purpose of donating bone marrow to her ill sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the heart of the film is psychological. The children don’t try to escape or resist their fate. Two of the main characters do try to achieve a small stay of execution that they believe is permitted, but they never try anything outside of the rules laid out for them.They simply accept and live out their fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up in our world, such acceptance seems ridiculous. But these children didn’t grow up in our world. Everything they’ve ever known, every adult they’ve ever known or trusted has told them that this is their purpose and destiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a political statements, this film uses the premise to subtly suggest that we all should question the assumptions we have about our own lives, especially those learned in childhood. What would someone who didn’t grow up in &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; world think it’s ridiculous for us to accept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, some think &lt;a href="http://content.foxsearchlight.com/inside/node/4694"&gt;Never Let Me Go is the most wrongly overlooked film of 2010&lt;/a&gt;. And Carey Mulligan, as always, is magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27068" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/are-western-zoologists-imperialistic/a-male-snub-nosed-golden-monkey/"&gt;&lt;img title="A male snub-nosed golden monkey" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-male-snub-nosed-golden-monkey.jpeg?w=190&amp;amp;h=275" alt="" width="190" height="275"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fig. 1.  A male golden snub-nosed monkey (from &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; article, photo by George Wong/European Pressphoto Agency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, in today’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times’s Opinionator &lt;/em&gt;column, Richard Conniff details a tiny controversy about this very beast.  The question is who gets credit for “discovering” the species.  Conniff says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, for instance, I wrote that a 19th-century French missionary and naturalist in China, Pére Armand David, had “discovered” the snub-nosed golden monkey. A reader sent me this somewhat testy comment: “The answer to the question ‘who discovered it’ is actually the Chinese.” Père David had merely “observed it and introduced it (and many other animals) to the West and into the Western zoological system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has increasingly been talk, in these postmodern times, about who gets credit for “discovering” stuff.  And there is a point: it now rankles a bit to hear that Columbus “discovered” America when, after all, people had been living there for over ten thousand years.  How far does this apply to “discovering” species?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conniff continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;David himself may never actually have seen these mountain-dwelling monkeys in the wild. Instead, his Chinese hunters brought him six specimens in the course of a long and productive expedition into western Sichuan province. David shipped the specimens back to Paris, along with more than 100 other mammal species. There, in an act of blithe cultural hodgepodgery, a French naturalist described the golden monkey in a scientific journal and gave it the species name roxellana to commemorate the Ukrainian wife of an Ottoman Turkish sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, because monkey and wife both had distinctive up-turned noses. You can see how this might leave people in China feeling a little left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed. Some countries, such as Brazil, wary of “biological imperialism,” have passed strict regulations about what kind of material can be taken out of the country by foreign biologists.  The species of a country are not simply a resource to be plundered by—or used to advance the careers of—biologists from other places.  And we’re becoming more sensitive to this: scientists from more biologically-savvy nations are involving locals (who, after all, often help them &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; the species, and know an enormous amount of natural history) in the scientific descriptions of new discoveries. You will often see strange one-word names, for example, on papers describing new species from New Guinea or Indonesia: those are the locals who helped find the species or made other contributions to its discovery. I rarely saw that when I was in graduate school thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do read Conniff’s column, for he describes a nearly forgotten chapter in the history of zoology:  how skilled but amateur naturalists, such as the missionary Pére David, made significant contributions to natural history. You may have heard of another species he discovered, the rare and eponymous Pére David’s deer, &lt;em&gt;Elaphurus davidianus:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-27075" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/are-western-zoologists-imperialistic/pere-davids_deer/"&gt;&lt;img title="pere-davids_deer" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/pere-davids_deer.jpeg?w=400&amp;amp;h=321" alt="" width="400" height="321"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;(Pére David’s deer is another interesting story. It has been extinct in the wild for a thousand years due to overhunting, and was discovered by Pére David in one place: The Emperor’s hunting park near Beijing.  It was exported to Europe, where it was bred in zoos, and subsequently disappeared completely from China. It was reintroduced to China in the 1960s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Conniff concludes that we shouldn’t stigmatize early Western naturalists as imperialistic, because their work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;. .  continues to save lives and protect resources today. The best evidence of its value is that every country from China to Gabon to Colombia now employs this scientific system of discovery and classification as a better way to understand not just our world, but theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Well, I’m not sure whether the use of Linnaean taxonomy is the greatest contribution of these naturalists.  After all, research has shown that indigenous peoples generally recognize the same species (although, of course, giving them different names) as do Western taxonomists.  In &lt;em&gt;Speciation&lt;/em&gt;, Allen Orr and I describe Ernst Mayr’s observation (made in the 1920s) that the tribesmen of the Arfak Mountains of New Guinea had 136 vernacular names for the 137 Linnaean species of birds they encountered, so even before Western taxonomists “invaded” the country, the distinct forms of bird life had already been correctly distinguished.  The names are just a way of formalizing new species and placing them in relationship to others already described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It’s not so much the nomenclature that Western biologists contributed to the countries they explored, then, but the calling of the world’s scientific attention to new species (their description does involve nomenclature, of course).  This immerses them into mainstream biological research—and, when species are endangered like Pére David’s deer, helps bring them to the attention of people who can save them.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there’s already &lt;a href="http://professorkateclancy.blogspot.com/2011/01/science-online-2011-even-when-we-want.html"&gt;an outstanding blog post&lt;/a&gt; by one of my co-panelists Kathryn Clancy that’s a must-read. She hit a home run reporting on our session entitled, “Perils of blogging as a woman under a real name” where we shared the floor with &lt;a href="http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/"&gt;Anne Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://joannelovesscience.com/"&gt;Joanne Manaster&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a sample, but I strongly encourage everyone to visit her blog for the entire piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;..while I think all my co-panelists had some very important things to say,  and some great stories (and awful stalker stories), the audience is  what made the panel. Here are a few things they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to be clear about how bad it really is to write under  your own name — some women have had no problems at all where others  have been driven out. Depending on the topic you write about and the  kind of audience you write for, you will have different experiences, and  many women will have only good experiences. We shouldn’t be too  negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people think writing for a female audience is lame.  Apparently there is a listserv of science writers, and about once a year  a conversation starts up about whether science writers should write for  women’s magazines — apparently many people come down on the side of  not thinking science writers should write for them. (My take? Any time  anyone says there is anything wrong with writing for women, it is  sexist.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One fantastic young woman talked about how she avoids  discussing her blog with her peers for fear of becoming the “soft skills  chick.” Doing anything other than the hottest science seems to  delegitimize women very quickly; however in some cases men get rewarded  for doing the same thing (examples that come to my mind are picking up  extra teaching and service, or having offspring, the latter being  empirically supported).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robin Lloyd already &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=woman-science-bloggers-discuss-pros-2011-01-18"&gt;mentioned this in her article&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/"&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt; attended our panel (one of, I think, only three men). He mentioned that  he gets DMed on Twitter regularly by men who want him to Tweet or  promote their posts. He said he had never been DMed for promotional  reasons by a woman. I was completely flabbergasted by this comment (and I  don’t think I was the only one), because it had never occurred to me  that I could even do that sort of a thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientopia.org/blogs/thusspakezuska/"&gt;The brilliant Zuska&lt;/a&gt; made several great comments (as Sheril pointed out, she really should  have been on the panel!). One that really struck me is that we need to  interrogate assumptions about women and provide empirical evidence  against them. The reason this came up was that we were discussing where  attacks can come from, and how sometimes the attacks come from women as  well as men. I believe someone made the comment that women can be worse,  and alluded to the idea that women make bad bosses for women. Zuska  pointed out that when you look at the evidence male bosses are still  worse to women than women are to women. And of course, towards the end  of the panel Zuska also used what is likely her most famous and beloved  line, “I want to puke on their shoes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an honor and privilege to spend the hour with such the incredible group of women and men in the room. This is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2007/09/19/sex-in-the-blogosphere/"&gt;not a new subject&lt;/a&gt;, but one I hope we will continue to address on- and offline as science–and the blogosphere–continue to evolve.

&lt;p&gt;But if you’re a fan of the New Orleans Hornets, are you aware of what happens before the anthem is sung?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sportslogos.net/images/logos/6/226/full/q8cgr5dizhfukxvgzk5zf3dt6.gif"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sportslogos.net/images/logos/6/226/full/q8cgr5dizhfukxvgzk5zf3dt6.gif" width="200" height="195"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hornets247.com/blog/2011/01/23/drink-pray-play-basketball/"&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;Joe Gerrity&lt;/strong&gt; at Hornets247&lt;/a&gt; (an unofficial fan site):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Before each and every Hornets game for as long as the team has been in existence, a Christian invocation is done at half court before the national anthem, in which everyone is asked to rise&lt;/strong&gt;. George Shinn, a devout Christian, began having this done long ago in Charlotte and then brought the practice to New Orleans. For the many years, he remained the only NBA owner in the league to do such a thing. Now that he’s gone and the league controls the team, the question should be asked- &lt;strong&gt;Why is a league owned team in clear support of one religion over any other?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a great question.  Joe updated his post to add that a Rabbi conducts the invocation “once in a blue moon,” but I don’t see the need for any prayer at all at an NBA game.  Still, I’m &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/06/14/interview-with-tom-krattenmaker-author-of-onward-christian-athletes/"&gt;used to hearing&lt;/a&gt; about professional sports teams having chaplains and pre-game prayers (if that’s a surprise to you, read &lt;strong&gt;Tom Krattenmaker&lt;/strong&gt;‘s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0742562476?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0742562476"&gt;Onward Christian Athletes: Turning Ballparks into Pulpits and Players into Preachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerrity adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can’t help but think that if the religious prayers spoken before games were Muslim or Hindu that somebody would have said something about it already, but here we are dozens of games into the NBA’s first team ownership and they have yet to address this very unique aspect of the team’s home court experience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBA is a private organization, but this is a very select way to advance religion.  My guess is they’re either unaware of the practice (unlikely), want to keep a tradition going (possible), or they are aware of the practice but are too afraid to say anything (my money’s on this one), but why keep it going when it might alienate many of the fans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Christian fans balked at the thought of the prayers being stopped, it shouldn’t matter. The NBA could just say it’s adopting standard practices or that it’s not a league defined by any particular faith and getting rid of the practice would allow the team to cater to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of its fans instead of a select group of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like an easy fix.  Why would the NBA keep this practice going?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, NBA Commissioner &lt;strong&gt;David Stern&lt;/strong&gt;, what are you going to do about this?&lt;br&gt;

It is breathtakingly ridiculous. He claims that the reason  Gaskell was not hired was religious oppression, overt discrimination against him for the fact of being a Christian. A university in America would have virtually no faculty or staff if they had an unspoken policy of discrimination against the Christian majority in this country; there were believers on that committee, I'm sure, just as there are believers on every committee I've ever worked with at my universities, and the atheists are usually the minority. So to claim that this committee thought that the idea of a candidate going to church was grounds for exclusion is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaskell's employment was questioned, not because he is a Christian, but because he is an evangelical Christian &lt;i&gt;who used his authority as an astronomer to mislead the public about biology&lt;/i&gt;. That was a question of responsibility and competence, well within the domain of inquiry by a hiring committee. It was not about his private, personal religious practices, but how he would engage the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cothran, though, has to carry his argument into the realm of offensive stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of its arguments used to defend UK's actions was that Gaskell would have public outreach responsibilities and that his religious views would embarrass the university.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let's apply this to a similar discrimination case against, say, an African-American, a group protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let's say the University of Kentucky was looking for an agriculture extension officer for a part of the state with a racist history. The job obviously involved public outreach.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And let's say an African-American applied for the job and was clearly the most qualified applicant.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But there were faculty and staff who indicated in e-mails they didn't think highly of blacks and who engaged in a concerted effort to torpedo his candidacy for the job, and one of the reasons was that they felt his race would impair his ability to do outreach in this part of the state.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I think we all know what would happen, and it would have little to do with a potential hire embarrassing the University of Kentucky. It would have a whole lot to do with the university embarrassing itself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This isn't diversity. It isn't equal treatment. It isn't tolerance. UK got off the hook by paying a relatively small settlement in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. Christians. Just like the oppressed African-American minority, with their long history of suffering and repression, and their current underprivileged state in which they are excluded from positions of leadership by bigotry. That whole argument reveals much about Martin Cothran and his coddled Christian privilege, and not much about the University of Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his hypothetical example, imagine that this well-qualified applicant was great at helping farmers with the job of raising crops (he's well qualified!), but would also go off and lecture them about how Kentucky was first settled by Egyptians who developed the system of agriculture, Kentucky bluegrass, and thoroughbred racehorses, which are all descended from purely African stock. I think the agriculture department would be justified in questioning his suitability for employment, not because of his race, but because he is promoting &lt;i&gt;false&lt;/i&gt; ideas justified by a very narrow and ignorant myth about African contributions to history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's Gaskell. He wasn't turned away because he was a Christian, but because he actively uses Christianity as an excuse to peddle falsehoods and doubts. And the objection wasn't to the "Christian" part, but to the "false doubts" part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/tin-eared_martin_cothran.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/9C4AxNWNObM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295884557752"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=4788">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53030d0e8f3ca2d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="You Tube"/><title type="html">Little Kitten – Paranormality Illusion</title><published>2011-01-24T15:55:32Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T15:55:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/mVoVEDTgPJ0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2011/01/little-kitten-paranormality-illusion/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zPhllqQp54"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zPhllqQp54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First all, if you pay attention to brain scanning, you have probably heard a story about fish in fMRI machines that has become the stuff of scientific legend. The salmon in question being scanned for brain activity was deceased. Pushing up daisies. Size feet under. Joined the choir invisible. In a word, dead. 

Yet a brain scan revealed statistically significant brain activity.

Bennett and colleagues were making a point that simple statistics on brain scans could be misleading. But they may have inadvertently dampened other salmon related scanning studies. Brain scans are increasingly being used on small animals. Here, brain scanning gets turned towards studying one of the oldest and deepest questions about salmon behaviour: their ability to return home.

Salmon, like sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), are hatched in freshwater streams. From there, they swim out to the ocean, spend years growing and growing, then swim back to the same watershed they were hatched in. That ability to find that original stream, out of the hundreds or thousands pouring into the oceans baffled people for a long time.

Given the complexity of the task, there is probably going to be no single explanation for the salmon’s homing ability, but it seems like smell is playing a large role. There is both behavioural and physiological evidence supporting this. 

It’s difficult to build up a cohesive picture of brain activity associated with something like smelling with traditional electrophysiology. You can only record a few cells in a brain at a time. This is where fMRI can shines: looking at the big picture.

You would predict would that the salmon’s brain would show some responses that would occur to pretty much any odour, and a different response to water from the stream a salmon was reared in when it was young.

The trick in an experiment like this is what do you use for a control? Fresh water was used as the “rest” baseline stimulus. To test something that had a definite smell that wouldn’t be associated with a stream, Bandoh and colleagues used amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and lots of aquatic organisms respond strongly to amino acids in the water. Amino acids are probably the equivalent of the smell this gives off:

The stream water contains amino acids, too, but at concentrations about 20,000 times lower than the amino acid solution used as a control. The experimenters gave the fish fresh water for 10 minutes, an odour  for 10 minutes – either the stream water or water laced with amino  acids – and then back to non-smelly fresh water for 10 minutes.

The two fluids caused very similar brain activation in the olfactory bulb, which is is basically one step from the nose. If anything, the amino acids activate the bulb more strongly than the stream water.

But things started to differ as the signal went deeper into the brain, through more steps of processing.

When you got into the main part of the brain, the telencephalon, the stream water caused some areas of the brain to activate that the amino acids didn’t. And those regions that were activated by both, the response was stronger to stream water than the amino acid mix.

There are all sorts of interesting questions you could ask with these methods. Could you show that fish that get lost and don’t make it back to their home stream show a weaker signal than those that do? Could you show migrating species have this signal but not non-migrating species? While these could be answered with other techniques, it seems that fMRI might be able to do it a bit more efficiently.

In reality, that picture is quite complex, with many layers of regulation that affect those cycling proteins.  A recent paper from the Nurse lab pares down all of that complexity to show us that the simplicity really has been there all along.     The cell cycle is the sequence of events that leads to a cell’s division and is regulated by two classes of molecules – cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).  Progression through the cell cycle is an orderly process, yet the integration of all players involved is complex—different CDKs associate with different cyclins, which are synthesized and degraded at different times, and these associations are regulated by their localization, interaction with inhibitors, checkpoint mechanisms, and complex feedback loops.  A recent paper shows that a single cyclin-CDK “engine” is the core mechanism driving cell cycle progression in fission yeast.  Coudreuse and Nurse show that without all of the regulatory inputs and feedback loops, a single engineered module containing Cdc2 (a CDK) and Cdc13 (cyclin B) is sufficient to drive cell division.  Image above is of a fission yeast cell going through the cell cycle with this engineered module – top row shows the appearance and degradation of the engineered module, while the bottom row shows the DNA.Adapted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd, copyright 2010.Coudreuse, D., &amp;amp; Nurse, P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said he doesn’t think questions about President Obama’s citizenship should play a role in the discussion of policy matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years into the Obama administration, so-called birthers continue to argue that Obama isn’t a natural-born citizen and that he hasn’t proved he’s constitutionally qualified to be president. Birth records in Hawaii haven’t dissuaded them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor, interviewed Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said he believes Obama is a citizen and that most Americans are beyond that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s an issue that we need to address at all. It is not an issue that even needs to be on the policymaking table right now whatsoever,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantor refused to call people who question Obama’s citizenship “crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s nice to call anyone crazy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is interesting–are they “crazy”, or are they self-deluded, self-deceived, as we all are some of the time about matters in our own lives, or matters that contradict our beliefs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m growing increasingly convinced that outside of true mental illness, people believing weird things–or even being in denial about certain facts–is not craziness or insanity. Rather, it’s very normal, even if often lamentable. It’s human nature to convince yourself of things that humor your prior beliefs. In this case, the prior belief is a certain strain of Obama hatred, but it could be pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why Cantor’s stand is important–because as Brendan Nyhan &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/why_facts_fail_brendan_nyhan/"&gt;explained on Point of Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, the more we see a uniform rejection of birther claims across the punditariat and political world, and especially on the Republican side, the more they will become simply untenable. At that point, many birthers will still cling to their beliefs–but their wrongheaded view, much like the view that cigarettes don’t cause lung cancer, will no longer trouble serious discourse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295879503859"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=50425">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f3025388711ece4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="economists"/><category term="research"/><title type="html">North American Economists Are Losing Market Share</title><published>2011-01-24T14:30:32Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T14:30:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/iAQh3ohMqV4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/north-american-economists-are-losing-market-share/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A new research paper shows that North American economists have lost a lot of market share in research publication to the rest of the world -- but mainly to European economists.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/iAQh3ohMqV4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By FREAKONOMICS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295877941436"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=27010">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c03a20c304c67301</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="Top Post"/><category term="European Space Agency"/><category term="impact"/><category term="Mars"/><category term="Mars Express"/><category term="Phobos"/><title type="html">Phobos is, like, totally groovy</title><published>2011-01-24T14:00:07Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T14:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/24/phobos-is-like-totally-groovy/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As recently &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/12/its-rabbithhh-phobos-season/"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;, the European Space Agency’s Mars Express probe &lt;a href="http://webservices.esa.int/blog/post/7/1317"&gt;made a very close pass of the small moon Phobos&lt;/a&gt;, taking incredibly detailed pictures of the spud-shaped rock.

Specifically I was asked to comment on the arguments of Dr. Richard Kent, a UK creationist. &lt;a href="http://www.freechristianteaching.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=75"&gt;On his evolution- debunking site he claims&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation demonstrates that the Moon is getting farther from the Earth by two inches every year. This indicates that the Moon used to be closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes very serious problems to the Evolutionists, because the proximity of the Moon to planet Earth controls the height of the tides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent’s arguments are bad, even for a creationist. It made me wonder if UK creationists are not as experienced or sophisticated as their American counterparts. Kent argues that 4 billion years ago the tides would have been so large that life would not have been possible. However, life was restricted to the ocean until about 500 million years ago – it is not clear by large tides would have been a problem for bacteria living in the ocean. In fact, the high tides were perhaps a boon to ocean life as they scoured the land and deposited minerals into the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent also has this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The magnetic forces of attraction between the Moon and the Earth  become very slightly weaker every year, so that, in general, tides  become slightly lower on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it when cranks get basic scientific facts wrong, because it so clearly exposes their intellectual laziness and scientific illiteracy. The tides are caused by the gravitational forces between the earth and moon, not magnetic forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But actually I wonder if Kent is one step ahead of his American counterparts, because Kent is not claiming that 4 billion years ago the moon would have been inside the earth or within the Roche limit (which many creationists falsely claim), but perhaps has tried to rescue this failed argument with his point about the tides being too high. That may be giving him too much credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/young-age-for-moon-earth/"&gt;gives the more standard earth-moon argument&lt;/a&gt; for why the earth cannot be 4.5 billion years old. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present speed of recession of the moon is known. If one multiplies  this recession speed by the presumed evolutionary age, the moon would be  much farther away from the earth than it is, even if it had started  from the earth. It could not have been receding for anything like the  age demanded by the doctrine of evolution. There is as yet no tenable  alternative explanation that will yield an evolutionary age of 4 billion  years or more for the moon. Here is as simple a proof as science can  provide that the moon is not as old as claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists love the evolution knock-out punches – the one argument or line of evidence that all by itself proves evolution is impossible. Of course, if their argument were true it would present a huge, perhaps fatal, problem for evolution. Interestingly they often simultaneously claim that evolution is not falsifiable – and then they try to falsify it. Evolution is falsifiable, and if any of these killer creationist arguments were true, evolution (or at least certain aspects of it) would be falsified. Alas, they are all silly and/or outdated arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the ICR and countless other creationist sites are still using the earth-moon distance argument to falsify evolution is also very telling. The argument has been destroyed years ago (during the 1980s and in great detail by the 1990s), but the facts do not seem to get in the way of a good creationist argument. The creationist strategy is clear – find some anomaly that scientists have not yet fully explained and then claim that the anomaly proves evolution is false, or the big bang did not occur, or the sun or moon or earth cannot be billions of years old. Anomalies, however, are not good proofs – they just reveal the fact that our knowledge is incomplete. Scientists treat anomalies as opportunities to deepen our understanding, to great success. Creationists see anomalies as propaganda opportunities, and never let go, even when the anomaly is later explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the distance of the moon was a genuine anomaly. The basic facts are this – the moon is moving away from the earth due to the transfer of angular momentum from the earth to the moon as a result of the tidal interaction between the two. At present the moon is moving away by about 2.5 cm per year (there is some debate as to this exact figure that I do not want to get into here). The ICR and other creationists assume (usually without expressly stating that assumption)  that the 2.5cm per year figure is constant, and can be extrapolated simply into the past. This turns out to be a false assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact manner in which the earth transfers momentum to the moon as a result of the tidal interaction is actually fairly complex. It is affected by the surface features on the earth. Depending upon how you model the earth the calculation can be dramatically different. Initial figures, in fact, produced an age of the earth-moon system that was far too great. But then later revisions came out with an upper limit of 1-2 billion years – short of the needed 4.5 billion years. Creationists latched onto this historical state of the evolution of our understanding of the tidal forces on the earth moon system, because it served their purpose, and then they stopped updating their arguments as the science progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turning point came with the discovery of plate tectonics – the continents on the earth were not always where they are now. In fact for much of the history of the earth all the land mass was joined in one supercontinent or another. This dramatically affects the calculations for momentum transfer. Modern calculations, with better models of the earth and the earth-moon interaction, now agree with a 4.5 billion year old earth. Anomaly solved. &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/moonrec.html"&gt;Talk origins has a thorough discussion of the history of this calculation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information is now freely available, for more than a decade. The creationist argument was always thin, little more than anomaly hunting and denial. But now it is also outdated. The fact that they do not acknowledge the actual science and they stick to their simplistic and wrong models tells us everything we need to know about the scientific and intellectual integrity of creationism.&lt;/p&gt;

So I am skeptical of the extraordinary claim that Jesus resurrected since I cannot dismiss my present experience. I must judge the past from my present. I cannot do otherwise!

Unfortunately, somebody or some algorithm is getting a bit sloppy, and it also returns articles for Answers in Genesis, the Institute for Creation Research, and Creation Ministries International.

Specifically I was asked to  comment on the arguments of Dr. Richard Kent, a UK creationist. &lt;a href="http://www.freechristianteaching.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=75"&gt;On his evolution- debunking site he claims&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation demonstrates that the Moon is getting farther  from the Earth by two inches every year. This indicates that the Moon  used to be closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes very serious problems to the  Evolutionists, because the proximity of the Moon to planet Earth  controls the height of the tides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent’s arguments are bad, even for a creationist. It made me wonder  if UK creationists are not as experienced or sophisticated as their  American counterparts. Kent argues that 4 billion years ago the tides  would have been so large that life would not have been possible.  However, life was restricted to the ocean until about 500 million years  ago – it is not clear by large tides would have been a problem for  bacteria living in the ocean. In fact, the high tides were perhaps a  boon to ocean life as they scoured the land and deposited minerals into  the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent also has this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The  magnetic forces of attraction between the Moon and the Earth  become  very slightly weaker every year, so that, in general, tides  become  slightly lower on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love it when cranks get  basic scientific facts wrong, because it so clearly exposes their  intellectual laziness and scientific illiteracy. The tides are caused by  the gravitational forces between the earth and moon, not magnetic  forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But  actually I wonder if Kent is one step ahead of his American  counterparts, because Kent is not claiming that 4 billion years ago the  moon would have been inside the earth or within the Roche limit (which  many creationists falsely claim), but perhaps has tried to rescue this  failed argument with his point about the tides being too high. That may  be giving him too much credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/young-age-for-moon-earth/"&gt;gives the more standard earth-moon argument&lt;/a&gt; for why the earth cannot be 4.5 billion years old. They write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  present speed of recession of the moon is known. If one multiplies   this recession speed by the presumed evolutionary age, the moon would be   much farther away from the earth than it is, even if it had started   from the earth. It could not have been receding for anything like the   age demanded by the doctrine of evolution. There is as yet no tenable   alternative explanation that will yield an evolutionary age of 4 billion   years or more for the moon. Here is as simple a proof as science can   provide that the moon is not as old as claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists  love the evolution knock-out punches – the one argument or line of  evidence that all by itself proves evolution is impossible. Of course,  if their argument were true it would present a huge, perhaps fatal,  problem for evolution. Interestingly they often simultaneously claim  that evolution is not falsifiable – and then they try to falsify it.  Evolution is falsifiable, and if any of these killer creationist  arguments were true, evolution (or at least certain aspects of it) would  be falsified. Alas, they are all silly and/or outdated arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That  the ICR and countless other creationist sites are still using the  earth-moon distance argument to falsify evolution is also very telling.  The argument has been destroyed years ago (during the 1980s and in great  detail by the 1990s), but the facts do not seem to get in the way of a  good creationist argument. The creationist strategy is clear – find some  anomaly that scientists have not yet fully explained and then claim  that the anomaly proves evolution is false, or the big bang did not  occur, or the sun or moon or earth cannot be billions of years old.  Anomalies, however, are not good proofs – they just reveal the fact that  our knowledge is incomplete. Scientists treat anomalies as  opportunities to deepen our understanding, to great success.  Creationists see anomalies as propaganda opportunities, and never let  go, even when the anomaly is later explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the  distance of the moon was a genuine anomaly. The basic facts are this –  the moon is moving away from the earth due to the transfer of angular  momentum from the earth to the moon as a result of the tidal interaction  between the two. At present the moon is moving away by about 2.5 cm per  year (there is some debate as to this exact figure that I do not want  to get into here). The ICR and other creationists assume (usually  without expressly stating that assumption)  that the 2.5cm per year  figure is constant, and can be extrapolated simply into the past. This  turns out to be a false assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact manner in which the  earth transfers momentum to the moon as a result of the tidal  interaction is actually fairly complex. It is affected by the surface  features on the earth. Depending upon how you model the earth the  calculation can be dramatically different. Initial figures, in fact,  produced an age of the earth-moon system that was far too great. But  then later revisions came out with an upper limit of 1-2 billion years –  short of the needed 4.5 billion years. Creationists latched onto this  historical state of the evolution of our understanding of the tidal  forces on the earth moon system, because it served their purpose, and  then they stopped updating their arguments as the science progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  turning point came with the discovery of plate tectonics – the  continents on the earth were not always where they are now. In fact for  much of the history of the earth all the land mass was joined in one  supercontinent or another. This dramatically affects the calculations  for momentum transfer. Modern calculations, with better models of the  earth and the earth-moon interaction, now agree with a 4.5 billion year  old earth. Anomaly solved. &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/moonrec.html"&gt;Talk origins has a thorough discussion of the history of this calculation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  information is now freely available, for more than a decade. The  creationist argument was always thin, little more than anomaly hunting  and denial. But now it is also outdated. The fact that they do not  acknowledge the actual science and they stick to their simplistic and  wrong models tells us everything we need to know about the scientific  and intellectual integrity of creationism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295871030922"><id gr:original-id="http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2011/01/article-review-online-curriculum-for.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1bb8168200cb68ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Article Review: Online curriculum for non-EM residents in the ED</title><published>2011-01-24T06:00:13Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T06:00:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://academiclifeinem.blogspot.com/2011/01/article-review-online-curriculum-for.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In many academic Emergency Departments, there are &amp;quot;off-service&amp;quot; or non-EM residents rotating in the department. They are sometimes invited to the EM residency conference series for the month. Often times though, they have too many departmental didactic events and obligations of their own that they don&amp;#39;t have time to attend formal EM didactics.This is the perfect opportunity for an online didactic curriculum, which can be viewed at the residents&amp;#39; own time. The faculty at Northwestern designed such a curriculum, called the Northwestern University Rotating Resident Curriculum (NURRC). The curriculum consists of 6 voiceover lectures:ENT and OphthalmologyEnvironmentalObstetrics and GynecologyOrthopedicsToxicologyTrauma and Wound CareMethodologyThe NURRC team conducted a 9-month, prospective, randomized study of 54 rotating residents (internal medicine and surgical subspecialties). All residents took one of two 42-question tests (A or B) as a pretest. The residents were then randomized into the control (no formal didactics) or experimental group (NURRC access). At the 2-week mark, both groups took the other test as a post-test (A or B). NURRC access was then made available to the control group as well. At the end of the 4 weeks, both groups completed an anonymous satisfaction survey. All residents who completed study participation received a $10 gift card to a local cafe.Results54 of 58 residents completed the study (92%)There was no difference in pretest scores between groups (52.6% controls, 50.8% NURRC group)The post-pre test score difference was 1.6% (control) and 17.3% (NURRC group)43 of the 54 resident completed the survey (79.6% response rate)All lectures received at least a 80% approval rating.My ThoughtsAlthough this study had a relatively small sample size (n=54), there things that the investigators did right:Although 5 of the NURRC group admitted to no viewing the online modules, they were kept in the study group based on the intention-to-treat model.There was a great participation rate (92%) and survey response rate (79.6%). I&amp;#39;m guessing the gift card made a big difference.A linear regression analysis was performed to show that test version (A vs B) and resident specialty did not impact the study results.ReferenceBranzetti JB, Aldeen AZ, Foster AW, Mark Courtney D.

&lt;p&gt;Your blog is nothing short of fantabulous and it keeps baby scientists like myself going.&lt;br&gt;
I take the first half of my qualifying exams tomorrow morning, and as a result am losing my shit.&lt;/p&gt;

It is clear that some people think &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000236.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The bus blew up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is in the passive; that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000991.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The case took on racial overtones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is in the passive; that &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1227"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Reuben deeply regrets that this happened&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is in the passive; and so on. Our grumbling about how these people don't know their passive from a hole in the ground has inspired many people to send us email asking for a clear and simple explanation of what a passive clause is.  In this post I respond to those many requests.  I'll make it as clear and simple as I can, but it will be a 2500-word essay; I can't make it simpler than it is.  There is no hope of figuring out the meaning of grammatical terms from common sense, or by looking in a dictionary. &lt;i&gt;Passive&lt;/i&gt; (like its opposite, &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt;) is a technical term. Its use in syntax has nothing to do with lacking energy or initiative, or assuming a receptive and non-directive role.  And the dictionary definitions are often utterly inadequate (&lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passive"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Webster's&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is simply hopeless on the grammatical sense of the word). I will try to explain things simply and accurately. If I fail, then the whole of your money will be refunded.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p&gt; I won't be talking about passive &lt;b&gt;sentences&lt;/b&gt; or passive &lt;b&gt;verbs&lt;/b&gt;. Sentences are too big and verbs are too small. We need to talk about &lt;b&gt;clauses&lt;/b&gt;.  A clause consists, very roughly, of a verb plus all the appropriate things that go with that verb to complete a unit that can express a proposition, including all the optional extras modifying that proposition.  Sentences can contain numerous clauses, some passive and some not, so talking about passive sentences doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.  Nor does &amp;quot;passive construction&amp;quot; if you define it, as &lt;i&gt;Webster's&lt;/i&gt; does, as a type of expression "containing a passive verb form". That would be far too vague even if English had passive verb forms; but in fact it doesn't have any such thing. &lt;p&gt; This essay avoids using the rather strange traditional term for the distinction in which active is one choice and passive the other: &lt;b&gt;voice&lt;/b&gt;. It mainly serves to confuse people.  The active/passive "voice" contrast has nothing to do with finding your voice or having a loud voice or the authentic voice of an oppressed people. &lt;p&gt; I'll need to use three abbreviations: a noun-phrase like &lt;i&gt;a storm&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;the roof&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;City Hall&lt;/i&gt; will be referred to as an &lt;b&gt;NP&lt;/b&gt;; a verb-phrase like &lt;i&gt;blew in&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;damaged the roof&lt;/i&gt; as a &lt;b&gt;VP&lt;/b&gt;; and a preposition-phrase like &lt;i&gt;with the others&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;by a bear&lt;/i&gt; as a &lt;b&gt;PP&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;p&gt; Fasten your seatbelt; here we go.  Ten short sections follow. You can ignore the footnotes at the end of section 7 without much loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt; English has a contrast between kinds of clause in which one kind has the standard mapping between grammatical subject and semantic role and the other switches those roles around.  In the kind of clause called &lt;b&gt;passive&lt;/b&gt; some non-subject NP you would expect within the VP is missing, and instead the VP is understood with that NP as its subject. &lt;p&gt; Take the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;damage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as an example.  Active uses of it involve a subject NP denoting a causer or initiator of damage — call that participant the &lt;b&gt;wrecker&lt;/b&gt;.  There is also a direct object NP, denoting something that suffers or undergoes damage; call that entity the &lt;b&gt;victim&lt;/b&gt;. An active clause with the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;damage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; would be something like &lt;i&gt;Hail damaged City Hall&lt;/i&gt;.  Notice that the subject NP (&lt;i&gt;hail&lt;/i&gt;) denotes the wrecker.  In a &lt;b&gt;passive&lt;/b&gt; use of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;damage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (I won't give one just yet, but I will in a minute) you would see a form of the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;damage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; used in such a way that the subject of the clause does not denote the wrecker; it denotes the victim.  &lt;p&gt;(What about the NP that denotes the wrecker, then?  As we'll see, it doesn't have to be expressed at all in a passive clause.  If it is expressed, it is put into a PP in the VP, with the head preposition &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt;: you would add &lt;i&gt;by hail&lt;/i&gt; to the VP.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; Crucial to the form of passive clauses is the notion of a &lt;b&gt;participle&lt;/b&gt;. Nearly all verbs in English (though not quite all) have two tenseless forms with special endings: the &lt;b&gt;past participle&lt;/b&gt;, which typically ends in &lt;i&gt;-ed&lt;/i&gt; (but for irregular verbs may end in &lt;i&gt;-en&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;-t&lt;/i&gt; or have no ending or may have some yet more irregular form), and the &lt;b&gt;gerund-participle&lt;/b&gt;, which always ends in &lt;i&gt;-ing&lt;/i&gt;.  Here are a few example forms for various verbs (I include for each verb the &lt;b&gt;plain form&lt;/b&gt; that you would look up in the dictionary plus the &lt;b&gt;3rd singular present&lt;/b&gt; form ending in &lt;i&gt;-s&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;b&gt;preterite&lt;/b&gt; or simple past tense form, followed by both the participles in red):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border="" cellpadding="5"&gt;

&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;went&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;gone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;going&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;having&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;keep&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;keeps&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;kept&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;kept&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;keeping&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;nibble&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;nibbles&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;nibbled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;nibbled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;nibbling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;writes&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;i&gt;wrote&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;written&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt;&lt;font color="#AA0000"&gt;&lt;i&gt;writing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice that for fully regular verbs like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;damage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;nibble&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and for some irregular verbs, the past participle is identical in written form and pronunciation to the preterite form. &lt;p&gt; The relevance of participles is that &lt;b&gt;a passive clause always has its verb in a participial form&lt;/b&gt;.  (In the vast majority of cases it&amp;#39;s the past participle, but there is an exception, to be considered later, in section &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt; The next thing to note is that participles never have tense, yet virtually all kinds of English independent clauses are required to have tense. This means that a clause formed of a subject and a participial VP understood in the switched-around manner — what &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; calls a &lt;b&gt;bare passive clause&lt;/b&gt; — can hardly ever stand on its own.  But there are a couple of exceptions.  One is newspaper headlines.  Here is an imaginary headline that has the form of a passive clause and nothing else: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;City Hall damaged by hail&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt; Who or what is the wrecker here, semantically?  The hail.  And the victim? Obviously, &lt;i&gt;City Hall&lt;/i&gt;, which is the subject of the clause that makes up this headline.  The usual roles are reversed.  Normally the wrecker would be denoted by the subject NP, placed before the verb, and the victim would be denoted by the object NP, after the verb.  But in the headline above they are switched. &lt;p&gt;Bare passive clauses are not only seen in headlines; one other place you see them is when they are used as modifiers.  It's somewhat literary, but common enough.  A few examples, with the bare passive clause modifier underlined: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;That said&lt;/u&gt;, we should not forget that it has also done some good.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;The day's work done&lt;/u&gt;, they made their way back to the farmhouse.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.&lt;/b&gt; The imaginary headline &lt;i&gt;City Hall damaged by hail&lt;/i&gt; is not an ordinary independent clause in non-headline contexts. To make it into an ordinary independent clause, we need to give it a &lt;b&gt;tense&lt;/b&gt;, either present or preterite.  But the verb of the passive clause has to be a participle, so it can't have tense.  So there has to be &lt;b&gt;an extra verb&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;p&gt; One verb that very commonly accompanies passive clauses is the item known to linguists as the &lt;b&gt;copula&lt;/b&gt;. Its plain form is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and the other forms are &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;aren't&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;wasn't&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;weren't&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;been&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;being&lt;/i&gt;. English often makes passive clauses into tensed clauses by using some tensed form of the copula. The subject goes before the copula rather than before the participle in the passive clause, and the rest of the passive clause comes after the copula (it's an &lt;b&gt;internal complement&lt;/b&gt; in the VP). &lt;p&gt; So to express in the preterite tense the claim that hail damaged City Hall, we could employ the verb &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; (that is, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the preterite form that is appropriate for a third-person singular subject), with &lt;i&gt;City Hall&lt;/i&gt; in the grammatical subject function, and following that the past participle &lt;i&gt;damaged&lt;/i&gt;.  To make the wrecker explicit, as I said above, we simply add the PP &lt;i&gt;by hail&lt;/i&gt;.  The result is the sentence on the right below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;PASSIVE CONSTRUCTION&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hail damaged City Hall.&lt;/i&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;City Hall was damaged by hail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The verb &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; adds no real meaning of its own to the passive; it just enables the whole thing to be in the preterite tense so that the event can be asserted to have occurred in the past.  Changing &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; would put the clause into the present tense, and replacing it by &lt;i&gt;will be&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;is going to be&lt;/i&gt; would permit reference to future time; but &lt;i&gt;damaged by hail&lt;/i&gt; would stay the same in each case.  The participle &lt;i&gt;damaged&lt;/i&gt; does not itself make any past time reference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.&lt;/b&gt; Using the copula is not the &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; way to make a passive clause that says hail has damaged City Hall.  It is &lt;b&gt;often&lt;/b&gt; true that a passive clause contains the copula, but &lt;b&gt;not always&lt;/b&gt;.  This is why it is so disastrous that ignorant writing tutors circle all forms of the copula they notice, writing "Don't use the passive" in the margin (take a look at &lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/grammar/passives.html#nopassives"&gt;this terrible example&lt;/a&gt;).  They are picking up on something that only sometimes occurs near passive clauses.  Many passives don't have the copula, and many uses of the copula are not associated with passives.  The other verbs that sometimes accompany passive clauses include &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;come&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;go&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and a few others (though there are all sorts of limitations on the constructions that different verbs require).  Here are a few examples, with the main clause verb boldfaced and the passive clause underlined: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mary &lt;b&gt;got&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;arrested at the demonstration yesterday&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Don't &lt;b&gt;get&lt;/b&gt; your private life &lt;u&gt;discussed by the newspapers&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;saw&lt;/b&gt; him &lt;u&gt;attacked by a flock of birds&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;had&lt;/b&gt; this &lt;u&gt;made for me by a carpenter&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Susan &lt;b&gt;had&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;her car stolen&lt;/u&gt; last week.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;The problems with the building &lt;b&gt;went&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;unnoticed by the owners&lt;/u&gt; for weeks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This software &lt;b&gt;comes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;pre-installed by the manufacturers&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these examples will typically go unidentified as passives if you ask bad writing tutors or trust bad grammar-checking programs. (So will the foregoing sentence.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.&lt;/b&gt; In all of the examples so far, the NP missing from the VP is a &lt;b&gt;direct object&lt;/b&gt;. Transitive verbs like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;arrest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;discuss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;attack&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;notice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;install&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, etc., just have one NP in the VP, and it's the direct object. In a passive, it is the NP that turns up as the subject. But this is one more thing that is not always true in passives, but only sometimes. &lt;p&gt;First, the non-subject NP can be an indirect object. That's what we see here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;PASSIVE CONSTRUCTION&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;The School gives each graduate student a laptop.&lt;/i&gt;       &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each graduate student is given a laptop.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, more interestingly, the non-subject NP can be &lt;b&gt;inside a PP&lt;/b&gt;: it can be the complement of a preposition in the active.  This is what we see in the following active/passive pair, where the active has a PP (enclosed in brackets) and in the passive version there is a &lt;b&gt;stranded&lt;/b&gt; preposition (I put the relevant PP in square brackets, and show by ‘__’ the gap in the passive where the missing NP would have been.):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;PREPOSITIONAL PASSIVE CONSTRUCTION&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;His classmates sneered&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;at him&lt;/i&gt;].       &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;He was &lt;u&gt;sneered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;at&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; __] &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;by his classmates&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This construction is the &lt;b&gt;prepositional passive&lt;/b&gt; (some linguists have called it the &lt;b&gt;pseudo-passive&lt;/b&gt;).  All the verbs that take passive clause complements can take prepositional passives.  In the following examples the passive clause is underlined, but I don't bother to show the gap after the stranded preposition: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mary &lt;b&gt;got&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;picked on&lt;/u&gt; at the demonstration yesterday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Don't &lt;b&gt;get&lt;/b&gt; your private life &lt;u&gt;talked about by the newspapers&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;saw&lt;/b&gt; him &lt;u&gt;pecked at by a flock of birds&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;had&lt;/b&gt; this &lt;u&gt;worked on by a carpenter&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;If you've ever &lt;b&gt;had&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;your poetry laughed at by an audience&lt;/u&gt; you'll know how I feel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;The problems with the building &lt;b&gt;went&lt;/b&gt; &lt;u&gt;unlooked at by the owners&lt;/u&gt; for a long time.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt; In English prepositional passives are quite frequent, especially in relatively informal style.  Most languages don't have anything like it (Norwegian is a rare example of a language that does). &lt;p&gt; There are some peculiar restrictions on prepositional passives in English. One is that there can be a difference in acceptability according to whether the subject denotes an entity that is tangibly altered in state: &lt;i&gt;This bottom bunk has been slept in&lt;/i&gt; is dramatically more acceptable than ??&lt;i&gt;This bottom bunk has been slept above&lt;/i&gt;, apparently because sleeping in a bunk bed alters its state (the sheets are wrinkled and so on), while sleeping in the top bunk above it doesn't alter its state at all. Intuitively, you use a prepositional passive when the VP expresses a relevantly important property of the subject.  That's a restriction on prepositional passives, because there is nothing peculiar about the active version &lt;i&gt;Someone has slept above this bottom bunk&lt;/i&gt;. (Why would a language have a restriction like that?  Who knows. I don't make or try to enforce any of the rules; I am merely trying to explain what the rules seem to be.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7.&lt;/b&gt; The participle in a passive clause is &lt;b&gt;nearly&lt;/b&gt; always a past participle, but not quite always: most dialects of English have a construction called the &lt;b&gt;concealed passive&lt;/b&gt; in which the verb of the passive clause is in the &lt;b&gt;gerund-participle&lt;/b&gt; form.  Most commonly a concealed passive clause follows the verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, as in these examples: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;It needed washing anyway&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;That rash needs looking at by a specialist&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt;In these examples &lt;i&gt;washing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;looking&lt;/i&gt; are gerund-participles, but the sense is still clearly the one that indicates the passive — the subject of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;wash&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; does not denote the person who does the washing, and the subject of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; does not denote the specialist. &lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Four footnotes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note 1. For some speakers there are a few verbs other than &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that allow this construction.  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; may allow it, for example.&lt;br&gt;Note 2. There are people (some of them Americans) who say &lt;i&gt;It needs washed&lt;/i&gt;; but I think that is accounted for by simply saying that they allow &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to take a subjectless passive clause complement just like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; does.&lt;br&gt;Note 3. In the 18th century there was another passive-like construction with a gerund-participle: the so-called &lt;b&gt;passival&lt;/b&gt;, as in &lt;i&gt;His tooth was pulling out by a dentist&lt;/i&gt;, where a gerund-participle is the complement of the copula. That is another matter, and a purely historical one; but see &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2903"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for recent Language Log discussion of the passival.&lt;br&gt;Note 4. I am not dealing here with the case of those few transitive verbs that are sometimes used intransitively with the subject understood the way the object would have been understood: cases like &lt;i&gt;His books sell quite well&lt;/i&gt;, which means something like "The enterprise of somebody selling his books is going quite well". This construction is sometimes called the &lt;b&gt;middle&lt;/b&gt;. Notice that it differs from the passive in that it can't take a &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt;-phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.&lt;/b&gt; You can of course leave out all reference to the agent in a passive, precisely because the agent isn't the subject, and only the subject is fully and always obligatory in a tensed clause: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;The mayor had the building &lt;u&gt;torn down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t express the identity of the agent of the actual physical tearing down at all — though in this case the identity of the official who gave the order is clear enough, so there&amp;#39;s no evasiveness about responsibility.  The context might be one in which we don&amp;#39;t know which company did it, and any company could have, and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which one it was.  But you don&amp;#39;t have to leave the agent unexpressed in a passive.  You could say this: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;The mayor had the building &lt;u&gt;torn down by his brother's demolition company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt;The demolition agent is specified here, as you might want it to be if corrupt awarding of city contracts was suspected.  So notice that the passive construction has &lt;b&gt;absolutely nothing to do with&lt;/b&gt; the notion of being &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000991.html"&gt;vague about agency&lt;/a&gt;: you can be as explicit as you want to be about who or what did the stuff that the clause talks about, and whether you use a &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt;-phrase may not even matter.  The passive is often better suited to being explicit about agency than the active is, because the end of the verb phrase is an ideal place to put something you want to emphasize: &lt;dir&gt; &lt;i&gt;Don't you see?  The patient was murdered &lt;b&gt;by his own doctor!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/dir&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's no vagueness or evasiveness about whodunnit there: it whacks you in the face with the identity of the murderer.  If you want to name names and point fingers, there's often no better way to do it than with a passive construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.&lt;/b&gt; I have not done full justice to this topic; in particular, I have not opened up the topic of the close relation between passives and predicative adjective constructions (phrases like &lt;i&gt;uninhabited&lt;/i&gt; are rather clearly adjectival, since there is no verb *&lt;i&gt;uninhabit&lt;/i&gt;).  But although I have not been fully exhaustive, I hope I have made it clear that almost everything said about passives in standard books of writing advice (and most of what linguistics books say as well) is mistaken.  Indeed, often wildly mistaken. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The passive is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; an undesirable feature limited to bad writing, it's a useful construction often needed for clear expression, and every good writer uses it. &lt;li&gt;The passive does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; always involve a use of the copula. &lt;li&gt;The passive does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; always involve masking the identity of the agent — it can be used to put the spotlight on the agent. &lt;li&gt;The NP that is the subject in a passive is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; always the one that would have been the direct object if the clause had been designed as an active one: it can be an NP that would have been the complement of a preposition — some passive clauses involve stranded prepositions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.&lt;/b&gt; One other thing.  As mentioned on Language Log &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003366.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, the people who criticize the passive the most tend to use it more than the rest of us.  George Orwell warns against the passive in his overblown and dishonest essay &amp;quot;Politics and the English language&amp;quot;. E. B. White does likewise in the obnoxiously ignorant little book he coauthored with Strunk, &lt;i&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/i&gt;.  Both of these authors have a remarkably high frequency of passives in their work: around 20 percent of their clauses with transitive verbs are cast in the passive, a distinctly higher frequency than you find in most of the prose written by normal people who don't spend their time pontificating hypocritically about the alleged evil of the passive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s amazing is how Hawaii is only the first state to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what prompted this decision?  One person’s complaint about how this was a Christian-specific prayer, not an “all-inclusive” prayer like so many city councils and state legislatures pretend to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A citizen’s complaint had prompted the American Civil Liberties Union last summer to send the Senate a letter noting that its invocations often referenced Jesus Christ, contravening the separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That prompted the state attorney general’s office to advise the Senate that their handling of prayers — by inviting speakers from various religions to preach before every session — wouldn’t survive a likely court challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, said Democratic Majority Leader Brickwood Galuteria.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not anti-religion. This is about keeping government and religion separate, just as it should be, and just as the Constitution demands it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Christian groups are complaining.  As far as I can tell, no non-Christian group opposes this measure.  It’s just an admission that the prayers were directed at the Christian god only:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“They (the ACLU) continue to threaten governments with lawsuits to try to force them into capitulating to their view of society,”&lt;/strong&gt; said Brett Harvey, an attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund, made up of Christian lawyers to defend free faith speech. “Governments should take a stand for this cherished historical practice.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their view of society”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mean the one that follows the law?  The one that defends the Constitution?  The one that shows respect for people of all faiths and no faith?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah… clearly, the ACLU hates America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican state Senator &lt;strong&gt;Sam Slom&lt;/strong&gt; wants to keep the prayer intact for a ridiculous reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“As intelligent as we may be, we can still call on someone higher to help us and guide us.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can… but no one’s going to listen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you spent more time figuring out what would help your constituents and less time talking to the air, you’d be guided in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of thanks go to people like &lt;strong&gt;Mitch Kahle&lt;/strong&gt;, who risked jailtime for &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/12/05/government-prayer-protesters-found-not-guilty-in-hawaii/"&gt;protesting the illegal prayers&lt;/a&gt; — he was found not guilty of disorderly conduct last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-05-at-10.52.15-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-05-at-10.52.15-PM-550x346.png" alt="" title="Hawaii" width="550" height="346"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the complaints and protests work, let’s get rid of Christian prayers and faux-secular invocations in all the other states, too.&lt;br&gt;

One of the great things about the mass personal genomic revolution is that it allows people to have direct access to their own information. This is important for the more than 90% of the human population which has sketchy genealogical records. But even with genealogical records there are often omissions and biases in transmission of information. This is one reason that HAP, Dodecad, and Eurogenes BGA are so interesting: they combine what people already know with scientific genealogy. This intersection can often be very inferentially fruitful.

But what about if you had a whole population with rich robust conventional genealogical records? Combined with the power of the new genomics you could really crank up the level of insight. Where to find these records? A reason that Jewish genetics is so useful and interesting is that there is often a relative dearth of records when it comes to the lineages of American Ashkenazi Jews. Many American Jews even today are often sketchy about the region of the “Old Country” from which their forebears arrived. Jews have been interesting from a genetic perspective ......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Have you ever had the feeling that everyone else seems so sorted, so at ease? You look about you and see friends chatting over lunch, people laughing on their mobiles, others escaping contentedly through novels or newspapers. According to Alexander Jordan and colleagues, most of us have such a tendency to underestimate other people&amp;#39;s experience of negative emotion. In turn the researchers think this skewed perception perpetuates a collective delusion in which we all strive to present an unrealistically happy front because we think that&amp;#39;s the norm. 

Jordan&amp;#39;s team began their investigation by asking 63 undergrads to describe recent negative and positive emotional experiences they&amp;#39;d had. As expected, the negative examples (e.g. had an argument; was rejected by a boy/girl), more than the positive examples (e.g. attended a fun party; had a great meal), tended to occur in private and to provoke emotions that the students had attempted to suppress.

The most frequently cited of these experiences were then put to separate set of 80 students whose task was to say how many times in the last two weeks they had lived through something similar, and to estimate how often their peers had. The important finding here was that the students consistently underestimated their peers&amp;#39; experience of negative events (by an average of 17 per cent) whilst slightly over-estimating their peers&amp;#39; experience of positive situations (by 5.6 per cent). 

What about close friends - surely we have a more accurate sense of their emotional lives? A third study was based on emotional weekly blogs kept by over 200 students, which they used to rate their experience of various positive and negative emotions over the course of a term. Each blog student then nominated a close friend or romantic partner who had to estimate the range of emotions the blogger had experienced that term. Consistent with the study&amp;#39;s main message, close friends and partners tended to underestimate the bloggers&amp;#39; experiences of negative emotions and to overestimate their experiences of positive emotions. A deeper analysis of the data suggested the underestimation of negative emotion was partly mediated by the bloggers&amp;#39; deliberate suppression of their negative emotions. 

A final study showed that students with a greater tendency to underestimate their peers&amp;#39; negative emotions also tended to feel more lonely, less satisfied with life and to ruminate more, thus suggesting that underestimating others&amp;#39; misery could be harmful to our own well-being. Of course the causal direction could run the other way (i.e. being lonely and discontented could predispose us to think everyone else is happier than they are), or both ways. The researchers acknowledged more research is needed to test this.

Assuming the present results can be replicated, an enduring mystery is why we continue to underestimate other people&amp;#39;s misery whilst knowing full well that most of our own negative experiences happen in private, and that we frequently put on a brave, happy face when socialising. Why don&amp;#39;t we reason that other people do the same? Jordan and his colleagues think this is probably part of an established phenomenon in psychology - &amp;#39;the fundamental attribution error&amp;#39; - in which people downplay the role of the situation when assessing other people&amp;#39;s behaviour compared with their own.

A fascinating implication of this research is that it could help explain the popularity of tragic art, be that in drama, music or books. &amp;#39;In fictional tragedy, people are given the opportunity to witness &amp;quot;the terrible things in life&amp;quot; that are ordinarily &amp;quot;played out behind the scenes&amp;quot;,&amp;#39; the researchers said (quoting Checkhov), &amp;#39;which may help to depathologise people&amp;#39;s own negative emotional experiences.&amp;#39;

PhylOTU: A High-Throughput Procedure Quantifies Microbial Community Diversity and Resolves Novel Taxa from Metagenomic Data (doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001061). 

The paper discusses a new software program &amp;quot;phylOTU&amp;quot; which is for phylogenetic-based identification of &amp;quot;operational taxonomic units&amp;quot;, which are also known as OTUs.   What are OTUs?  They are basically clusters of closely related sequences that are used to represent something akin to a species.  OTUs are used a lot in environmental microbiology b/c one key way to study microbes in the environment is through extraction and sequencing of DNA.  Traditionally this has been done through PCR amplification and sequencing of one particular gene (ss-rRNA).  Now it is also being done through random sequencing of all DNA from environmental samples (so called metagenomics).

Anyway - the paper is (of course) fully open access and you can read it for more detail.  Just thought I would post a little here about it.  The paper / project was led by Tom Sharpton, a post doc in Katie Pollard&amp;#39;s lab at UCSF working on a collaborative project between Katie&amp;#39;s lab, my lab, and Jessica Green&amp;#39;s lab at U. Oregon (and recently Martin Wu&amp;#39;s new lab at U. Virginia - he was in my lab previously).  This collaborative project even has a name &amp;quot;iSEEM&amp;quot; which stands for integrating statistical, evolutionary and ecological approaches to metagenomics.  This project has been generously supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (via a grant for which I am PI).

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, there are topics that our readers want — nay, demand — that I cover. This next topic, it turns out, is one of them. It’s a link to a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com"&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt;. I’m guessing that most of our readers have either viewed (or at least heard of) TED talks. Typically, they are 20-minute talks, with few or no slides, by various experts and thought leaders. Many of them are quite good, although as the TED phenomenon has grown I’ve noticed that, not unexpectedly, the quality of TED Talks has become much more uneven than it once was. Be that as it may, beginning shortly after it was posted, readers of both this blog and my other super-not-so-secret other blog started peppering me with links to a recent TED Talk by Dr. Deborah Rhodes at the Mayo Clinic entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/deborah_rhodes.html"&gt;A tool that finds 3x more breast tumors, and why it’s not available to you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I resisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I’ve written about the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6940"&gt;issues of screening mammography&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1926"&gt;USPSTF guideline changes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3082"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, too), the early detection of cancer (including &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2249"&gt;lead time and length time bias&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=133"&gt;Will Rogers effect&lt;/a&gt;), and a variety of other topics related to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2249"&gt;early detection of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=565"&gt;overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=300"&gt;overtreatment&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, to put it bluntly, there really isn’t anything radically new in Dr. Rhodes’ talk, at least not to anyone who’s been in the field of breast cancer for a while. Certainly, there’s no new conceptual breakthrough in breast imaging and screening described. As I will discuss in more depth later in this post, there’s an interesting application of newer, smaller, and more sensitive detectors with a much better spatial resolution. It’s cool technology applied to an old problem in breast cancer, but something radical, new, or ground-breaking? Not so much. What Dr. Rhodes describes in her talk is the sort of device that, when I read about it in a medical journal, produces a reaction along the lines of, “Nice technology. Not ready for prime time. I hope it works out for them, though. Could be good.” So it was with molecular breast imaging (MBI), which is the topic of Dr. Rhodes’ talk. So I continued to resist for about two or three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then our very own Harriet Hall sent me the link. I cannot resist Harriet. When she suggests that perhaps I should blog about a topic, it’s rare that my response would be anything other than, “Yes, ma’am. How soon would you like that post and how many words?” &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I%20keed"&gt;I keed&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but only just. The best I could come up with was a wishy-washy “But this isn’t really anything all that new,” which is true enough, but the way Dr. Rhodes tried to sell the audience on the idea of her technology brings up a lot of issues important to our audience. I also thought it was important to put this technology in perspective. So here I go. First, I’ll start by describing what really set my teeth on edge about Dr. Rhodes’ talk. Then I’ll go to the primary literature (namely her brand, spankin’ new article in &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt; describing the technology) and discuss the technique itself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jacktruth.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/jacktruth.jpg" alt="" title="jacktruth" width="350" height="238"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;The truth? You can’t handle the truth!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What irritates me about Dr. Rhodes’ TED Talk starts right at the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography — women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn’t work well at all. Do you know which group you’re in? If you don’t, you’re not alone. Because the breast has become a very political organ. The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press, politicians, radiologists and medical imaging companies. I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth. But first, my disclosures. I am not a breast cancer survivor. I’m not a radiologist. I don’t have any patents, and I’ve never received any money from a medical imaging company. And I am not seeking your vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the talk, Dr. Rhodes says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this technology is widely adopted, I will not benefit financially in any way. And that is very important to me, because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you can guess what irritates me about these statements. Actually, it’s two things. First, it’s Dr. Rhodes’ invocation of “The Truth.” Strictly speaking, there is no “truth” in science or medicine. There are hypotheses that are supported by evidence, experimentation, and, in medicine, clinical trials, and there are hypotheses that are not. Most scientific hypotheses are not black and white “true” or “false,” either. Rather, individual hypotheses fall somewhere closer to being true or false, based on the evidence, and they can move closer to or father away from being “true” as new evidence comes in. Indeed, the object of scientific investigation is to falsify hypotheses. Hypotheses that are easily falsified fall by the wayside quickly. Those that are not advance to more intense testing. Those that have withstood the most attempts to falsify them and provide highly useful explanatory and predictive value might eventually graduate to being full-fledged theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing that irritates me is Dr. Rhodes’ implication that everyone else has an ax to grind (and is therefore probably lying to you), where as she does not because she doesn’t receive money from medical imaging companies, isn’t a breast cancer survivor, and is not a radiologist. Don’t get me wrong; financial conflicts of interest (COIs), particularly undisclosed ones, are very, very important to know about, because they can (and all too often do) warp the perspective of even the most diligent, honest, rigorous scientist. However, financial COIs are not the only COIs. Just because someone proclaims that she has no financial COIs (or professional COIs) does not mean that she does not have biases or COIs that can be just as strong as the financial COIs of scientists who stand to make a lot of money if their research results in a marketable drug, treatment, or medical device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I examine Dr. Rhodes’ invention (and her claims for it) in a bit more detail, in the interests of full disclosure, I’ll point out that I actually have a non-financial interest in a competing imaging technology for the breast. Researchers at our cancer institute have developed what I consider to be a truly innovative and promising breast imaging device. It’s based on ultrasound and can produce images of the breast almost as striking as those produced by breast MRI. This device has even resulted in a startup company that was featured in our governor’s state of the state address last week. As you can see, it’s a big deal to our cancer center. Since, through some fluke of flukes, I’ve somehow managed to find myself in leadership positions within the clinical and research breast cancer programs at my cancer center (obviously, the cancer center director hasn’t realized his mistake yet), I have a stake in the success of this device. More importantly, not only do we see the chance to have a major positive impact on women’s health if this device is validated but it would bring all sorts of prominence to our institution in general and my programs in particular, just as the success of Dr. Rhodes’ MBI device would improve women’s breast screening and bring all sorts of glory to the Mayo Clinic and her programs. None of this means that either Dr. Rhodes or I are likely to be lying or stretching the truth, but we both have COIs based on our belief in our respective devices. Arguably, my COI is less intense, because this device had been developed before I accepted my current job, and I am not directly involved in its commercialization. A COI does, however, exist nonetheless, and I acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that bugs me about Dr. Rhodes’ talk is her implication that the radiology world is somehow closing ranks to keep her from bringing this technology to the masses. While she does have a point that some radiologists were utterly shameless in protecting their turf and launching what can only be called histrionic attacks on the new guidelines (the quote by Dr. Daniel Kopans, a very prominent breast imaging radiologist at Harvard, about the USPSTF guidelines that Dr. Rhodes cites at 2:49 in the video being an excellent example), it’s a bit of a stretch to claim that somehow radiologists are so biased against &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; technology that they won’t give &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; a fair shake. Before I explain, I mention a couple of points that Dr. Rhodes makes that are correct. First, Dr. Rhodes is correct that breast density appears to be an independent risk factor for breast cancer that has only relatively recently been appreciated as such. Unfortunately, it is in dense breasts where mammography has the biggest problem in detecting cancer. Indeed, that’s part of the reason why it’s not as good in women under 50; their breasts tend to be denser. Second, she is most likely correct that digital mammography is probably not more sensitive or specific for detecting breast cancer, particularly in women with dense breasts, although I will point out that the evidence is not as cut and dried for this assertion as Dr. Rhodes makes it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rhodes also fails to mention that digital mammography does have some major advantages over conventional film mammography and that they are not inconsequential advantages, either. These include permanent storage and duplication of as many copies of a study as needed. In other words, if a woman goes for a second opinion, instead of taking a jacket full of films (what I was used to until relatively recently), she can take a CD and provide an exact copy of her suspicious mammogram to the consulting surgeon. In the old days, she would have to sign out her jacket or bring an inferior film copy. Lost films are a thing of the past, and instead of huge rooms full of large manila envelopes stuffed with X-ray films, the studies can now be stored on hard drives and backed up off site. Digital mammography also allows for the digital manipulation of the image, not to mention the development of image analysis algorithms that can assist the radiologist in detecting suspicious lesions. Finally, digital mammography &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100121135704.htm"&gt;probably requires less radiation&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in women with dense breasts, the very group in whom Dr. Rhodes is trying to increase sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection, although this benefit &lt;a href="http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/new_research/20100121b.jsp"&gt;hasn’t been fully verified yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I wouldn’t be all that surprised if there was some skepticism over her idea. I’ll explain why in a bit more detail in the next section. However, I really do think Dr. Rhodes goes overboard in implying in at least two parts of her talk that the radiology world and the mammography world are somehow conspiring (or at least so resistant to new ideas that the practical effect is the same as conspiring) to prevent new breast imaging technologies (like hers) from gaining a foothold. Perhaps the most egregious example is this passage, where she talks about having submitted her article to four different journals and having it rejected by each one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals. After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least she didn’t mention Galileo or Ignaz Semmelweis. I’m grateful for small favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this is a highly explosive charge to make so casually, without describing the evidence that led the authors to suspect that one of the reviewers had a financial COI in a competing technology. In fact, if three journals rejected her manuscript before &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt; apparently rejected it and then reconsidered it, did it ever occur to her that perhaps her manuscript just wasn’t very novel? Actually, the manuscript that ultimately was published in &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt; was pretty decent, but there are other reasons that papers, sometimes even good papers, have trouble being published. For instance, she didn’t say which journals she tried first before settling on &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, if she had tried the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; (JAMA), the reason her manuscript was rejected would be fairly obvious. It’s an interesting new technology with promising preliminary results, but not interesting enough to a broad enough audience to be likely to be published in such high impact journals. None of this implies that Dr. Rhodes’ work isn’t solid work, but the reluctance of journals to publish her results doesn’t suggest that MBI is a technology “they” don’t want you to know about, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Everything old is new again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Dr. Rhodes is charming and a very effective advocate for her preferred breast imaging technology. Nowhere is that more clear than the middle portion of her talk, where she describes the genesis of the MBI. Who wouldn’t be moved at her description of a friend who found a lump in her breast while she was pregnant (and Dr. Rhodes was pregnant as well), the fear it engendered, and how that event inspired Dr. Rhodes to wonder if there was a better way to detect breast cancer? Who didn’t find her account of serendipitously bumping into physicists, who told her about a new kind of gamma detector that was much smaller than previous generations of such devices, compelling? Who wasn’t appreciative of her description of the first device the medical physicists and Dr. Rhodes cobbled together with duct tape and those early primitive tests of its ability to detect radiotracer concentration in the breast? Certainly not me. The image of a bunch of brand new tiny gamma detectors cobbled together with duct tape was priceless. Nor do I in any way want to detract from the hard work and development that went into her MBI device. I do, however, have a small problem with how Dr. Rhodes discussed it in her TED Talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That problem is that scanning the breast with radiotracers as a means of looking for breast cancer is not a new technology at all. It’s been around for at least three or four decades. Go back to the 1960s, in fact, and it’s not difficult to find references to the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14296380"&gt;detection of breast cancer using various injected radioisotopes&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, at various times such techniques been called &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=386226"&gt;scintimammography&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary/?CdrID=386227"&gt;sestamibi breast imaging&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re all based on the same concept as many nuclear medicine imaging modalities: Inject a small amount of radiotracer that is differentially taken up (or not taken up) by the cell of interest or by cells exhibiting the disease process of interest (i.e., cancerous cells), and then take pictures. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans work this way. So do MUGA scans and bone scans. About 20 years ago, &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Technetium sestamibi became the most commonly used radioisotope for breast cancer detection in the breast (as opposed to looking for metastatic disease).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you read Dr. Rhodes’ &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21045179"&gt;recently published study in &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll quickly see that what Dr. Rhodes and her team are doing is nothing more than sestamibi breast scanning. Specifically, she is using technetium (&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc) sestamibi scanning combined with mammography. Currently, only one &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc sestamibi compound, Miraluma, which is manufactured by DuPont Pharmaceuticals, is FDA-approved for breast imaging in the United States, which is why such scans are &lt;a href="http://www.imaginis.com/breast-health/nuclear-medicine-breast-imaging-scintimammography"&gt;sometimes referred to as Miraluma scans&lt;/a&gt;. The same isotope is sold for cardiac imaging under a different name (Cardiolite). The problem with the various nuclear medicine breast scans for screening purposes has always boiled down to an unacceptable lack of specificity and sensitivity. That’s why I have to wonder if the reason for the skepticism that greeted Dr. Rhodes’ results isn’t at least in part due to a collective shrug of the shoulders, as reviewers thought, “Been there, done that.” Certainly, fair or unfair, that probably would have been my initial reaction if this paper had come across my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it’s a bad study or a technology without promise. Neither is true. In fact, as a proof-of-principle study it’s perfectly acceptable, and that’s all it’s billed as in the paper. The findings of the paper are summarized quite well in this figure (click to enlarge):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Figure3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Figure3-300x259.jpg" alt="" title="Figure3" width="300" height="259"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the study started out with 1,007 women with heterogeneously dense breasts enrolled and ended up with 936 women who completed all imaging whose data were available for analysis and whose cancer status was verified. Positive cancer status was defined as a positive biopsy showing cancer, while negative cancer status was defined as women who had a subsequent negative mammogram in the following year, a negative biopsy, or a negative prophylactic mastectomy. Reported sensitivities were 27% for mammography alone, 82% for gamma imaging (MBI) alone, and 91% for a combination of mammography and gamma imaging. The corresponding specificities were 91%, 93%, and 85%. All in all, these are good numbers, particularly when compared to mammography alone in women with dense breasts. Diagnostic yield was 3.2 per 1,000 for mammography alone, 9.6 per 1,000 for gamma imaging alone, and 10.7 per 1,000 for both. Finally, the positive predictive value (the chance of having cancer if the test is abnormal) was 3% for mammography, 12% for gamma imaging, and 8% for both. Basically, the study suggests that the addition of MBI with &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc sestamibi can increase the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection in women with dense breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it has to be pointed out that there were only 11 women with breast cancer in the entire population. This is lower than one would normally expect for a typical study of mammography, likely because of the large number of younger women (as young as 25) in the population studied. The reason for this was in order to include a lot of women with dense breasts. Unfortunately, this means that it doesn’t take very much to skew the numbers one way or another. What this implies is that a much larger study is very much indicated in order to get a more precise estimate of what the sensitivity and specificity of this test is and how much it really adds to mammography. My guess is that it will add something to the mammographic screening of dense breasts, but probably not as much as this initial study suggests. Sadly, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8987"&gt;the decline effect&lt;/a&gt; will likely rear its ugly head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another consideration here, namely the question of radiation. Dr. Rhodes touches on this issue in her talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast, we had to solve one very important problem. We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose. And we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this. And I’m very happy to report that we’re now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram. And at this low dose, we’re continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67 year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer. So this is not just young women that it’s benefiting. It’s also older women with dense tissue. And we’re now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that’s used in any other type of gamma technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard this, I wondered something. What is the effective total body dose? Injecting a radioisotope is a different thing than aiming an X-ray beam at the breast. &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc has a half-life of around six hours, which means that it takes 24 hours for the radiation levels to fall to 1/16 of the original. In this study, Dr. Rhodes administered &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc equivalent to 20 mCi. According to the chart included in &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/miraluma-drug.htm"&gt;this drug information&lt;/a&gt;, the estimated radiation dosimetry for a dose of 30 mCi of this tracer is 0.2 rads (approximately 0.2 cGy) to the breast, meaning that the dose used in this study was approximately 0.13 rads. Dr. Rhodes is correct that this is &lt;a href="http://www5.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6X_Mammography_and_other_Breast_Imaging_Procedures_5.asp"&gt;approximately the same amount of radiation as a single mammogram&lt;/a&gt; administers. However, she leaves out consideration of the dose of radiation to which other organs are exposed. For instance, 20 mCi of Miraluma results in a dose of approximately 2 rads to the small intestinal wall, 2.6 to 3.6 rads to the wall of the large intestine, 1.0 rads to the ovaries, and 0.3 rads to the bone marrow. In a single dose, these doses are not very high, but remember that we are talking about a screening test that is meant to be administered repeatedly, possibly even yearly, to women with dense breasts. Over the course of 30 years (or even more) of screening, the radiation dose to tissues other than the breast could rapidly add up, in addition to also adding to the dose of radiation to the breasts. These are not trivial concerns, particularly the potential for a significant cumulative whole body dose of ionizing radiation over decades of screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;The return of the revenge of the Will Rogers effect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I hate to be a spoilsport, but some of the images that Dr. Rhodes displayed to me did not impress me that much. For example, she showed an image where a mass was not seen on mammography but showed up on MBI. Here’s what bugged me: It was a 5 cm tumor, and, quite frankly, the signal from MBI was not that impressive at all. I also wonder if anyone actually — oh, you know — examined the patient. Most 5 cm tumors are palpable as masses. True, I’ve seen the occasional patient where such a large tumor is difficult to detect, but these patients are relatively uncommon. In another part of the talk, Dr. Rhodes showed one slide in which the mammogram showed one lesion, but the MBI showed three, one of which was only 3 mm in diameter. Unfortunately, she did not say whether pathology of the resected tissue verified that these were indeed separate foci of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this leads me to believe is that Dr. Rhodes either doesn’t acknowledge or doesn’t seem to understand the concept of the Will Rogers effect, more formally known as stage migration. This is the phenomenon where a new imaging modality detects tumor that couldn’t be detected before. The name is based on Will Rogers’ famous joke: “When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they raised the average intelligence level in both states.” This little joke describes very well what can happen after a new imaging modality is introduced into cancer diagnosis. Basically, the increased sensitivity of a new technique (like MBI) can result in a migration of patients from one stage to another that does the same thing for cancer prognosis that Will Rogers’ famous quip did for intelligence. For example, patients who would formerly have been classified as stage II cancer (any cancer) have additional disease or metastases detected that wouldn’t have been detected in the past, thanks to the new imaging modality. They are now, under the new conditions and using the new test, classified as stage III, even though in the past they would have been classified as stage II. This leads to a paradoxical effect in which the survival of both groups (stage II and III) appears better, even though there has not been any actual change in the overall survival of the group as a whole. This paradox comes about because the patients who “migrate” to stage III tend to have a lower volume of disease or less aggressive disease compared to the average stage III patient and thus a better prognosis. Adding them to the stage III patients from before thus improves the apparent survival of stage III patients as a group. Meanwhile, the patients who have extra disease detected by the new technology tend to be the stage II patients who would have recurred and done more poorly compared to the average patient with stage II disease; i.e., the worst prognosis stage II patients. But now, they have “migrated” to stage III, leaving behind stage II patients who truly do not have as advanced disease and thus in general have a better prognosis. Thus, the prognosis of the stage II group also ends up appearing to be better with no real change in the overall survival from this cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another effect, as well, an effect that was first noticed when breast MRI began to be widely used for the preoperative workup of breast cancer. Because of the greater sensitivity of MRI, frequently more disease was discovered than expected, leading to more extensive surgery. The mastectomy rate, which had been falling for decades as a result of the greater understanding among surgeons that breast conserving surgery resulted in the same survival rate as mastectomy, began to rise again. Over the last few years, evidence has been accumulating that the routine use of preoperative MRI does not improve survival rates or increase the rate of lumpectomies with negative surgical margins but &lt;a href="http://www.internalmedicinenews.com/news/oncology-hematology/single-article/panel-evaluates-use-of-mri-in-breast-cancer/9a2a28071e.html"&gt;does increase the rate of mastectomies&lt;/a&gt; (blogged &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=133"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In other words, when it comes to screening, as I have described many times before, more sensitivity is not always better. It might be better in the case of MBI because the sensitivity of mammography in women with dense breasts is pretty low, but we won’t know until we do the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to another part of this talk that irritated me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammography isn’t perfect, but it’s the only test that’s been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer. But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography’s most ardent advocates use to deter innovation. Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later. And most women, thankfully, survive. So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer. Mammography’s the only one that’s been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, on the TED Blog, Dr. Rhodes says that she thinks we should &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2011/01/13/the-politics-of-breast-cancer-qa-with-deborah-rhodes/"&gt;stop debating mammography&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the problem is whenever a new technology comes around, the mammography mafia, as we call them, says, “Your test is no good, because you can’t demonstrate a mortality benefit.” Well, of course we can’t demonstrate a mortality benefit. Mammography’s been around since the 1960s; they’re the only ones who have a prayer of demonstrating a mortality benefit, because it takes that long to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to stop debating mammography and put our resources into developing and evaluating alternative screening techniques for women with dense breasts. MBI is certainly a very promising technique, and there are other promising techniques. Second, we need to accept an endpoint for success that is not strictly mortality-based. Although mortality is the most important outcome, there are intermediate outcomes that can serve as acceptable proxies for mortality. For example, instead of insisting that each technique must demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer, I believe it is acceptable instead to evaluate whether one technique can find tumors at an earlier stage – in other words, small tumors that have not spread to the lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “mammography mafia”? Nice. I also wonder if Dr. Rhodes has considered the possibility of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=116"&gt;lead time bias and length bias&lt;/a&gt; in her screening test.  Whatever the case, in essence, Dr. Rhodes’ argument boils down to a case of special pleading, wherein she insists that a different, more lenient, standard be applied to her favorite technology than was applied to mammography and than is applied to any other screening test. I can’t agree. MBI should be subject to the same standards as any other screening test for breast cancer. If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the last 30 years or so of mammographic screening is that it’s harder than it seems it should be to save lives with a screening test and that screening tests have unintended costs and produce unintended harms. These have to be balanced against the benefits. We will never know for sure what these risks and benefits are for MBI if we don’t do the studies, and if it takes a decade or more to find out what they are, then so be it, particularly given that there is potential for harm as well as benefit. That’s how long it will take. Also remember this: MBI subjects the entire body to radiation in order to try to save lives from breast cancer. How do we know that repeated doses of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc sestamibi won’t result in the increased incidence of, for example, colorectal or ovarian cancer that cancel out any decrease in mortality observed that is attributable to better screening for breast cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t. And we won’t unless we do the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rhode’s MBI methodology is an example of a test that is evolutionary, not revolutionary. There is nothing whatsoever wrong with that, either. That’s how science advances, building incrementally on what has gone before. In fact, Dr. Rhodes and her coworkers are to be commended for taking a test that never caught on widely because of its low sensitivity and specificity and recognizing that the technology had developed to the point where it might be possible to overcome these limitations. I just wish she wouldn’t sell it to the general public as though it were some radical new test that the “mammography mafia” don’t want you to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a good thing indeed, because it means that where I practice is blissfully free (for the most part) of pseudoscience. Unfortunately, earlier this year, I was in for an unpleasant surprise when I found out that there was going to be a showing of a rather annoying movie. It also occurred to me that I had never, to my memory, discussed the topic of this movie, namely the health claims of raw ("living") food veganism. The vitalism at the heart of this movie and its accompanying "educational" DVD reminds me, more than anything else, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/the_notsobeautiful_untruth.php"&gt;The Beautiful Truth&lt;/a&gt;, which promoted the quackery that is the Gerson protocol. Whenever it occurs to me that there's a major topic in health that I haven't discussed in over six years of the existence of this blog, you know that sooner or later I have to rectify the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;em&gt;The Beautiful Truth&lt;/em&gt;, which was about the Gerson protocol and didn't feature any big names, this movie, &lt;a href="http://www.rawfor30days.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Simply Raw: Reversing Diabetes in 30 Days&lt;/a&gt;, features &lt;a href="http://www.rawfor30days.com/experts.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;at least a couple of big names&lt;/a&gt;. These include Morgan Spurlock, who directed and starred in the 2004 documentary &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me"&gt;Super Size Me&lt;/a&gt;, which featured Spurlock eating nothing but McDonald's food for 30 days and documented the effects that diet had on him, and actor and "raw food activist" Woody Harrelson. Both were interviewed for the movie, and a longer interview with Spurlock is featured as part of a promotional film series on the web that goes along with &lt;em&gt;Simply Raw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two trailers for the movie. First, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Le4VjQPlg"&gt;trailer #1&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSUw9SaPLmA"&gt;trailer #2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the introduction to the &lt;em&gt;Raw for Life&lt;/em&gt; DVD, a companion "A-Z encyclopedia" of "live food" veganism that is being sold as a companion piece to &lt;em&gt;Simply Raw&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/i_prefer_my_food_dead_thank_you_very_muc.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/i_prefer_my_food_dead_thank_you_very_muc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/HVhJssJAquI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295856156805"><id gr:original-id="http://www.replicatedtypo.com/science/imitation-and-social-cognition-in-humans-and-chimpanzees-ii-rational-imitation-in-humans-chimps/3113/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eee6955d1ef53555</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Imitation and Social Cognition in Humans and Chimpanzees (II): Rational Imitation in Human Infants and Human-Raised Chimps</title><published>2011-01-24T02:22:10Z</published><updated>2011-01-24T02:22:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/P1RDITgeBbY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.replicatedtypo.com/science/imitation-and-social-cognition-in-humans-and-chimpanzees-ii-rational-imitation-in-humans-chimps/3113/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Tweet

					

				

 

In my last post I wrote about two experiments on imitation in young children and chimpanzees by Lyons et al. (2005) and Horner &amp;amp; Whiten (2005).  Their results suggested that young children tend to copy both the ‘necessary’ and the ‘unnecessary’ parts of a demonstrator’s action wh0 shows them how to get a reward out  . . . → Read More: Imitation and Social Cognition in Humans and Chimpanzees (II): Rational Imitation in Human Infants and Human-Raised Chimps...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://www.vaccinetimes.com/number-of-flu-victims-in-the-uk-more-than-doubles-in-one-week-reaches-254/"&gt;Flu deaths in UK rise dramatically&lt;/a&gt; – Anti-vaxxers love to mock health concerns about flu, which they seem to think is no more dangerous than an hang nail. But I’d love to hear them tell the families of the 254 UK flu victims this flu season alone. The number came after the number of UK flu deaths more than doubled in just a one-week period. 195 of those deaths were confirmed to have been from the H1N1 strain and seven of the deaths were of children under the age of five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have incomplete information on vaccination status, but based on what  is known so far, among 71 cases in which vaccination status was known, &lt;strong&gt;83 percent had not received a flu shot&lt;/strong&gt; this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/01/20/parikh.childhood.immunizations/index.html"&gt;Should anti-vaxxers pay higher premiums? &lt;/a&gt;- I thought this was a particularly good idea from one physician. While it certainly won’t change the minds of the hardcore anti-vax fanatics who will likely just view it as part of the evil conspiracy, I do suspect that some people would be more inclined to get the vaccines to avoid paying more insurance premiums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refusing to vaccinate a child is dangerous not just for that child but  for entire communities. It’s precisely this point a colleague of mine  was considering when he had the idea that parents who refuse to  vaccinate their kids should pay substantially higher health insurance  premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense. Insurance, after all, is just a pool of money into  which we all pay. In determining how much we or our employers pay, risk  is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect analogy is smoking. If you  smoke — and want to turn your lungs black and spend a greater portion  of that pot of money on your possible chronic lung disease or any  cancers you’ll get — then you may have to pay more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why shouldn’t we impose the same logic on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/media/serve/20090823--093836-loc_06.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.timesofmalta.com/media/serve/20090823--093836-loc_06.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="148"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/21/wwjd-who-would-jesus-deny/"&gt;Georgia homeless shelter refuses service to gays&lt;/a&gt; – The horribly misnamed “House of Mercy” actually states flat-out that they will not provide services to gays because it goes against what the Bible says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… Elder Bobby Harris, who directs House of Mercy… says that his  organization simply cannot tolerate homosexuality in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“That act is not tolerated here at all. Let me tell you one  reason why: because of the bible, of course. And then we have little  children,”&lt;/strong&gt; Harris says. He then added that if a gay person  wants to change their sexual orientation and turn their life over to  religion, he would consider serving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Harris told the local press that he would welcome “non-practicing  gay people,” but even if the residents were to engage in sexual behavior  on their own time off the premises, they would be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No word on whether they also deny service to the divorced, shellfish-eaters, those who work on Saturdays, or those who refuse to stone their own disobedient children  to death. This is why you don’t rely on religious organizations for charity work. They often tend to care more about Jesus than about actually providing the services they promise. This is just disgraceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-0-0CE1FB15000005DC-259_468x714.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-0-0CE1FB15000005DC-259_468x714.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="258"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=407"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church to picket Kevin Smith’s latest film&lt;/a&gt; – According to Silent Bob himself, the WBC is coming to Sundance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those movie-crazy cine-nerds at &lt;a href="http://godhatesthemedia.com/"&gt;the Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; are coming to the &lt;a href="http://sundance.slated.com/2011/films/redstate_sundance2011"&gt;Sundance Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; to protest &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;… presumably for being gay…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they realize this will give the film much more attention and will dramatically increase people’s interest in seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

The research team from Bridgeport Hospital in Conencticut, examined patients in the 24 hours near admission by auscultating over the throat (glottis) during quiet breathing and speech.  Interestingly they mention examination near admission but they also include this caveat: &amp;#39;or at any time during admission.&amp;#39;  How often people were diagnosed on admission versus during the admission is not presented which may affect some of the results.  For example is gurgling a cause or an effect of hospital acquired pneumonia?  And if you are studying gurgling being a risk factor for the acquisition of hospital acquired pneumonia I think it would be important to just evaluate on admission.  Moving on....

They compared demopgraphics, residence co-morbidities, treatments, and outcomes to see what was asosicatied with gurgle on admission (or at any time during admission).  They enrolled 80 patients (20 with gurgle and 60 matched cohorts) on the same day of admission.  Those who were found to have a gurgle had higher incidence of hospital acquired pneumonia (55% v 1.7%), intubation, transfer to ICU and were associated with a increased age (78.5 v 65.2), nursing home residence, treatment with opioids or antipsychotics.

In Table 2 I do have some concerns about their conclusions since they leave out some key details, in particular the timing of events.

&amp;quot;In multivariate analysis, dementia (OR = 23.4; 95% CI, 4.2-131.9) and recent (within 24 h) treatment with opiates (OR = 14.7; 95% CI, 2.2-97.5) emerged as the only statistically significant independent predictors of gurgle (Table 2).&amp;quot;But could a reasonable conclusion also be that patients with dementia, of an advanced age, who acquire a pneumonia in the hospital and stay in the ICU and hospital an average of 14 days, may at some point receive opioids as the goals change away from a fading chance at recovery and more towards comfort measures only?

The main finding was that gurgling was far and away the biggest predictor (or associated symptom) of hospital-acquired pneumonia.

So what can we take away form this? Well if we hear gurgling in a patient it is important to document it, and to add in your notes this may be a risk factor for hospital acquired pneumonia and counsel the patient and family appropriately.  I am not sure we need to auscultate over the larynx.  Thoughts?

Another thing we can do is take this study, improve upon it and try and complete it from a hospice setting, or maybe in your own hospital.  I think the fundamentals are good, but some of the conclusions may be a bit premature.  Hopefully this also proves an important point of not relying on the summary from the authors and reading the article fully if you are going to change your practice.  Heck don&amp;#39;t even trust me, go read it for yourself.  Apparently the writers of The Hospitalist didn&amp;#39;t.  I originally saw this article highlighted in a clinical summary there.  They also agreed with the conclusion that opioid were also a predictor of gurgles, which I do not agree with.

I do have to compliment the authors on bringing up this important topic and for the following paragraph on the history of &amp;#39;gurgling&amp;#39; in medical literature (emphasis mine).

Although the exact origins of the term “death rattle” are not clear, in 1853, Barclay attributed it to Laennec, who also described “gargouillement” (gurgling). Laennec initially used the term “rale” (French for rattle) in his writings but recognized it might frighten patients familiar with the term “death rattle.” In 1859, Thomas Inman indicated that “…an abundant perspiration, and the ‘death rattle’ in the throat, have long been recognized in many diseases as immediate harbingers of death.” Although many have studied or discussed the acoustics and pathogenesis of adventitious sounds, gurgling does not fit authoritative descriptions of rales, wheezes, or ronchi. So, although gurgling has been appreciated by clinicians for centuries, its technical features and pathophysiology have not been well studied. Ours is the first study, to our knowledge, to suggest that not all seriously ill patients who gurgle die and that this examination finding is associated with HAP.It seems they tried hard to avoid the term &amp;#39;death rattle&amp;#39; as the mere use of the term presupposes the outcome, much like terminal delirium.  Both of these I feel should be used more in a retrospective manner when discussing about a particular patient or in a tone that discusses them as a possibility not a certainty.  I am curious why they didn&amp;#39;t go for my term of choice and the much more clinical/academic sounding &amp;#39;oropharyngeal secretions?&amp;#39;

It is characterized by painful eruption of vesicular lesions that follow a dermatomal distribution. The thoracic and lumber roots are most commonly affected.Pain precedes the appearance of the lesions and is severe and debilitating. The incidence and severity of herpes zoster increases with increasing age due to age related decline in immunity. Post herpetic neuralgia is a common complication of herpes zoster in the elderly. Facial nerve paralysis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus and bacterial superinfection are among other complications. Antiviral therapy with Acyclovir reduces the duration of the illness. A live attenuated Varicella Zoster Virus vaccine is also available to prevent herpes zoster.Herpes zoster in the neck. Image from wikipedia.In a recent study published in JAMA, Hung Fu Tseng et al. examined the effect of a Oka/Merck strain of varicella zoster virus based vaccine in reducing the incidence of herpes zoster. The study was a retrospective cohort study conducted among members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California. The study included 75761 vaccinated subjects in 60 years or more age group. 227283 unvaccinated subjects in 60 years of more age group were included as controls. The controls were randomly selected and age matched. Immunocompromised individuals were excluded from the study as the vaccine is contraindicated in them. Exclusion of immunocompromised subjects also removes its confounding effect as it is a risk factor for herpes zoster. The main outcome of interest was incidence of herpes zoster. Bias was accessed by measuring the rate ratios of 13 different acute conditions which are not protected by the vaccine. If the rate ratios of these conditions are not grouped around 1, it would indicate that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated groups differ from each other and unmeasured confounders are at play. The rate ratio of herpes zoster was much greater in magnitude than the other conditions indicating that the outcome was not due to any bias.In univariate analysis, the incidence of herpes zoster in vaccinated individuals was 6.4 (95% CI, 5.9-6.8) per 1000 person-years and among unvaccinated individuals, it was 13.0 (95% CI, 12.6-13.3) per 1000 person-years. The risk of herpes zoster among unvaccinated individuals varied with age, sex, race and lung disease. The difference in incidence of herpes zoster persisted upon adjustment for sex, race, chronic diseases and health care utilization. The fully adjusted analysis gave a hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.42-0.48). When a more strict criteria for immunocompetency was used, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.46 (95%CI, 0.43-0.49). The vaccine also reduced the risk of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and hospitalization due to herpes zoster. Overall reduction in incidence of herpes zoster was 55%.The limitations of the study are potentially unmeasured confounders and external validity.Reference:Tseng HF, Smith N, Harpaz R, Bialek SR, Sy LS, &amp;amp; Jacobsen SJ (2011).

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At that point, I asked whether anyone else in the class knew the word &lt;em&gt;blaji&lt;/em&gt;.  Out of approximately 50 takers and auditors in the lecture hall (probably about half know Mandarin), only one other female student was familiar with the word &lt;em&gt;blaji&lt;/em&gt; (N.B.:  two syllables), but she pronounced it very clearly as &lt;em&gt;bùlāji&lt;/em&gt; 布拉吉 (three syllables).  The same word is also transcribed as &lt;em&gt;bùlājí&lt;/em&gt; 不拉及.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After inquiring, I learned from the two students that the word&lt;em&gt; blaji / bùlāji&lt;/em&gt; means "dress" and was borrowed from Russian платье.  &lt;a href="http://blog.uchinatravel.com/?p=99"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;'s what a &lt;em&gt;blaji / bùlāji&lt;/em&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I was so startled by the consonant cluster at the beginning of the word as pronounced by the first student and was intrigued by the disparity between the pronunciation of the same word by the two students, I quizzed them both very carefully about how they learned the word.  It turns out that the first student, an undergrad who grew up mostly in America, but with Northeast China roots, is barely literate in Chinese characters, though she is fluent in Mandarin, and had learned the word &lt;em&gt;blaji&lt;/em&gt; strictly orally from her grandmother.  The second student is from a village close to the Russian border, had stayed in China her whole life until coming to graduate school in the United States, and is highly literate in Chinese characters, having attended Peking University as an undergraduate Chinese language and linguistics major, then coming to continue the same field of study as a graduate student in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fascinating how the student who is highly literate in Chinese characters unmistakably says &lt;em&gt;bùlāji&lt;/em&gt; for Russian платье, whereas the student who is barely literate in Chinese characters pronounces the same word as &lt;em&gt;blaji&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found the same phenomenon among Dungan speakers in Central Asia.  The Dungans are Muslims who fled Northwest China after failed rebellions during the latter part of the 19th century and ended up mostly in what are now Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  The Dungans are illiterate in Chinese characters, but literate in Cyrillic.  This has had a profound impact on the shape of words borrowed into their language from Russian, Persian, Arabic, and other languages.  Here I shall give only a single example, but it demonstrates exactly the same phenomenon as does the borrowing of Russian платье into non-sinographic Northeast oral Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Russian трактор ("tractor"), the Dungans say трактор, despite the fact that they speak two varieties of Northwest Mandarin.  In Modern Standard Mandarin, the word for "tractor" is &lt;em&gt;tuōlājī&lt;/em&gt; 拖拉機 ("drag-pull-machine," but with the first two syllables cleverly chosen to represent the first syllable of the original.&lt;/p&gt;

The Catholic Church is now wanting to &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110123/ap_on_re_eu/eu_vatican_marriage"&gt;exert its authority over straight marriages&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, even when it comes to straight marriages, "No one can make a claim to the right to a nuptial ceremony".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's right. To the Catholic Church, getting married isn't a right. It's a privilege that they should get to bestow as they see fit. Fortunately, America has kept such nonsense out of our laws when it comes to straights, but hypocritically uses religious reasoning to prohibit gay marriages. Living in a country by secular laws, there is no excuse for this.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-9007082751337886162?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295825007967"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=215849">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a6eaf480c30ab1ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="agave"/><category term="diabetes"/><category term="eating healthy"/><category term="nutrition"/><category term="sleep"/><category term="sugar"/><category term="Tara Stiles"/><category term="yoga"/><title type="html">Morning Links: Agave Nectar Is Natural, But Not Necessarily Healthy</title><published>2011-01-23T15:19:02Z</published><updated>2011-01-23T15:19:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/agave-nectar-natural-not-healthy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As time has passed over the years, it&amp;#39;s become harder and harder to jump in the water this time of year. But, therein lies no choice if one is to continue working as a diving contractor in New England. There is nothing pleasant about it, and all you can do is plan well in advance for the elements.

For the majority of the winter months, say late November through early March, we use hotwater suits when diving with surface-supplied equipment. So, despite the cold air temperatures, once the diver plugs in, he has bath temperature water surrounding his body for the rest of the day. From a comfort perspective, it&amp;#39;s better to be the diver than working topside all winter - though special consideration needs to given to dehydration. Every now and again however, a project comes up where SCUBA is the tool for the job. Requiring the autonomy of SCUBA means sacrificing hotwater, so we use the next best thing - drysuits. While &amp;#39;dry&amp;#39;, being warm isn&amp;#39;t always a reality, especially for extended exposures in the water.

A couple of days ago was a somewhat painful reminder of the effects of hypothermia on human performance. I was off the Rhode Island coast conducting a shipboard dive operation for a client who required that an instrument be recovered. Simple task, shallow depth, calm seas, but f-&amp;#39;ing cold outside. Rubber parts on your equipment become brittle and are at risk of cracking, o-rings are too stiff to adequately seal on regular/cylinder surfaces, and it is an ordeal in and of itself to just suit up on deck. Those are the mechanics - the simple stuff. The hard part is the psychological preparation for jumping in to the water.

And there I was on the stern of the boat, all suited up, and careful not to breathe into my regulator for fear of the condensation from my breathe freezing and causing a fee flow malfunction. The dive supervisor gives us the green light, reg in mouth, and off we go.

Now, I&amp;#39;ve been in colder environments than New England in the winter. I spent a couple of months in Antarctica in 2002 where we made several dives beneath the ice into the 27.4 degree Fahrenheit water.here however, diving is generally staged from heated huts to buffer the discomfort of taking the plunge. Out on a vessel, exposed, you start the day cold, and there&amp;#39;s no relief til it&amp;#39;s all over. This is no place to mess around, as hypothermia can settle in without even realizing the incremental impairment.

Hitting the water, I gasped. The air from my cylinder was freezing cold, and the water wasn&amp;#39;t much better. I breathed hard during the entire dive. The fact that my hands and face were chill-bitten didn&amp;#39;t even register, as I focused on my breathing and keeping a clear head to accomplish the work task. On hitting bottom, I checked my dive computer which registered 31 degrees Fahrenheit...

That was the COLDEST I have ever experienced the water in New England, and must have been an unusual wave of coldwater given that the regional temperature usually doesn&amp;#39;t drop below 36 this time of year. It just plain hurt, and I could clearly recognize the onset hypothermia given my mental state. Clouded judgement, slow reactionary times, and an innate response urge of  flight to the situation which I had to overcome to get the job done. Not good. The day required about one cumulative hour of dive time, and we did get the job done, but with a renewed respect and appreciation for operating underwater under these conditions.

I guess my point is to be careful out there. There is very little room for error when diving in general, and when the environmental conditions drastically reduce the margin, self-awareness and recognition of hypothermia symptoms are critical. Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and vasoconstriction - all of which are physiological responses to preserve heat. The fact that any or all of these might be taking place under a degree of mental confusion (symptom of early onset of MODERATE hypothermia) just complicates the situation and could lead to a cascading series of problems.

Bottom line - please be careful out there this time of year - both above and below the water.

Do you run a local skeptical or science group? Wanna become a big-ass robot and kick some alt-med ass? Here’s your chance. &lt;img title="Voltron" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/voltron-movie-giant-lion-robot.jpg" alt="Voltron" width="250"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10:23 campaign was started by a local skeptics group in Merseyside in the UK. I don’t even know where Merseyside is. But last year, they decided to try to stage an event where they would do a public homeopathic overdose. They put the word out to other local groups in the UK and the idea gained so much momentum that by the end of it, over 400 skeptics across the UK all ‘overdosed’ on homeopathic remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, they are bringing the campaign stateside. We have about 15 groups around the US that are interested in putting something together. On February 5, 2011, at 10:23 a.m. local time, we’ll all get together and speak out against this pseudoscience. Form blazing sword bitches! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been helping coordinate the US groups, and we’ve also got a lot of support from the JREF. They are providing tips and ideas for how to organize an event, ways to contact and deal with media and other great resources for local groups to take this idea and make it their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., we have a couple of extra challenges. Because homeopathy isn’t regulated in the same way here that it is in the U.K., a lot of groups have expressed concerns with staging an overdose.  There’s the possibility that a group could end up with something that actually has an active ingredient in it. So, in &lt;a href="http://www.atlantaskeptics.com/"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve decided to hold back on the overdose and do a &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaSkeptics/calendar/16146675/"&gt;demonstration and presentation&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a local group and you think you can put an event together, even if it’s a small one, you should do it. Even a small event at the local level makes for a more powerful message at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHhfQ0oxN2dnblVrYk1ZZnJXQVRxM2c6MQ"&gt;Here’s the link to sign up to get updates from the JREF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;. Also, find out more &lt;a href="http://www.1023.us"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced? The skeptics over at CFI-Vancouver staged an overdose event and look at the results they got!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;It is not always easy to translate between Italian and American sensibilities. There is no good English word for “veline,” the scantily clad Vanna White-like showgirls who smile and prance on television, doing dance numbers even in the middle of talk shows. And there is no word in Italian for accountability. The closest is “responsibilità” [sic] — responsibility — which lacks the concept that actions can carry consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, we've already covered the "No word for accountability" instance of the "No word for X" meme ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003925.html"&gt;Solving the world's problems with Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;", 12/16/2006), in a post where we learned from international bankers and others that there's no word for &lt;em&gt;accountability&lt;/em&gt; in any of the Romance languages (including specifically French and Italian), in Russian, in the languages of most if not all of the countries served by the Asian Development Bank (including specifically japanese and Chinese),  in Modern Hebrew, in Bemba, and so on. A &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;q=%22no+word%22+accountability&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22no+word%22+%22for+accountability%22&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=8d4e2956278ab392"&gt;quick web search&lt;/a&gt; will turn up additional specific references to the lack of (a word for) accountability in &lt;a href="http://elkym.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/responsibility-vs-accountability/"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hbT9YfkZFl8C&amp;amp;pg=PA225&amp;amp;lpg=PA225&amp;amp;dq=%22no+word+for+accountability%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=QJG-X7K4SK&amp;amp;sig=WwDU8GDJWkFo6odNXMnix0eEhkc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=Y4Q8TdvoCsL7lwe9__DpBQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=6&amp;amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=13&amp;amp;ved=0CCEQFjACOAo&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgroups.diigo.com%2Fgroup%2Feducators%2Fcontent%2Ftag%2Fteachers&amp;amp;ei=1oQ8TcSsCMWclgfc5oHNBg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFwqjh7WaeYkVSIJaEqmrieaYEC7g"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hayibo.com/outcomes-based-retardation-scrapped-but-no-snoek-beating-for-asmal/"&gt;Kedi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=24&amp;amp;ved=0CCYQFjADOBQ&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fcommentisfree%2F2009%2Fmar%2F24%2Fschools-academies&amp;amp;ei=SIU8TeqqCMT7lwfYicXLBg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG7-QvOXQjKADU-imh2ISkJMDHN-w"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;, etc., with others no doubt waiting on the next published after-dinner speech about the banking system in Iceland or Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's possible that only English-speakers can grasp the concept of accountability, at least if we accept that no one could possibly understand an idea that they need an expression longer than one word to name, or some context to interpret. The French, for example, would need to talk about having comptes à rendre, requiring three or even four words. This same limitation may explain why it's so difficult for us English speakers to get our minds around things like reforming the health insurance system, since we need five or six words even to refer to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To avoid being misunderstood by commenters who don&amp;#39;t follow links, I guess I&amp;#39;d better point out that the last paragraph was meant ironically…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial list of LL posts on this topic can be found &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1081"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tip of the hat to Ben Sprung]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — the &lt;a href="http://www.wordreference.com/iten/responsabilit%C3%A0"&gt;WordReference entry for &lt;em&gt;responsabilità&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives three senses, corresponding roughly to English "responsibility" (in the sense of being in charge of something), "guilt" (for which &lt;em&gt;colpa&lt;/em&gt; is also a possibility), and "liability", as in &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;società a responsabilità limitata&lt;/em&gt; "&lt;/span&gt;limited liability company". Along with combinations like &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;responsabilità civile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "civil liability" and &lt;em&gt;responsabilità penale &lt;/em&gt;"criminal liability", the third sense certainly seems to involve the notion that "actions can carry consequences".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as in French, there's no difficulty in deploying the specific idea of needing to answer to someone:  &lt;em&gt;dover rispondere a &lt;/em&gt;__, or  &lt;em&gt;dover rendere conto a&lt;/em&gt; __.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s true that Italian uses the same (single) noun for being in charge of something and being answerable for something — and distinguishes the senses by adding modifiers as contextually required, or uses verbal paraphrases where the idea of being answerable is to be made explicit in more detail. It&amp;#39;s not clear that this has anything to do with the cultural, social, political differences behind the way that Berlusconi&amp;#39;s scandals are treated.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — in the comments, Licina &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2920#comment-105042"&gt;points us&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://iate.europa.eu/"&gt;EU inter-institutional terminology database&lt;/a&gt;, which renders &lt;em&gt;accountability&lt;/em&gt; in Italian as &lt;em&gt;attendibilità, responsabilità, or assunzione di responsabilità&lt;/em&gt;. The translations into Spanish are &lt;em&gt;obligación de rendir cuentas, responsabilidad&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;rendición de cuentas; &lt;/em&gt;and into French, &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;responsabilisation&lt;/em&gt; (which seems to be a neologism)&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;obligation redditionnelle, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;obligation de rendre compte, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;responsabilité.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295811451748"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/weekend_diversion_sunday_funda.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f4a005f111387f9c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Weekend Diversion: Sunday Funday, for Beardos and Fans!</title><published>2011-01-23T19:11:08Z</published><updated>2011-01-23T19:11:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/weekend_diversion_sunday_funda.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was an old man with a beard,

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of you have weighed in on &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; face after reading my interview &lt;a href="http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=129305048992062100"&gt;in the Portland Tribune&lt;/a&gt; and seeing a recent picture.

&lt;p&gt;The beard -- inspired by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/11/weekend_diversion_beard_contes.php"&gt;my 2009 astronomy class&lt;/a&gt; -- has been growing ever since, and it's time to head on out and show it off.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the occasion?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_sunday_funda/photo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/weekend_diversion_sunday_funda/photo-thumb-500x766-60585.jpeg" width="500" height="766" alt="photo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/events/85510-2011-West-Coast-Beard-Mustache-Championships"&gt;2011 West Coast Beard and Mustache Championships&lt;/a&gt;, happening &lt;i&gt;this afternoon&lt;/i&gt; here in Portland!  (At &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=crystal+ballroom+portland&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hq=crystal+ballroom+portland&amp;amp;hnear=crystal+ballroom+portland&amp;amp;cid=0,0,16323769174163033190&amp;amp;ei=tWM8TZT9G4XGsAP-yJzcAw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local_result&amp;amp;ct=image&amp;amp;resnum=2&amp;amp;ved=0CCcQnwIwAQ"&gt;the Crystal Ballroom&lt;/a&gt;; spectators welcome starting at 3:30 PM for $10!)

Not just aesthetically, but also personality-wise; I feel just a little more comfortable in my own skin sporting the long, well-groomed facial hair than I did back when I was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until.php"&gt;completely bald&lt;/a&gt;.  I may have a ways to go before I can be considered alongside &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/battle_of_the_beards_darwin_vs.php"&gt;Darwin and Kelvin&lt;/a&gt; for best scientist beard (especially in terms of being a groundbreaking scientist), but I'm really happy with how &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/weekend_diversion_hey_beardo.php"&gt;it's coming along&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what&amp;#39;s more than that, this past summer I made it to my first beard &amp;amp; mustache competition; the 2010 Nationals.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the winners had &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; more impressive beards than I did.  Winner of beard competitions sport facial hair like this...

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" width="425" height="269" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vM5n8jESUEk" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for them, and to our increased mirth, their excuses are just as ridiculous as Suzie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Normal L. Geisler, author of If God, Why Evil?, said the video contains a lot of misconceptions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"You look at all of that [and] you sympathize with Susie because you think they (disasters, illnesses, etc.) are evil," he said. "But if it's evil, then there must be a standard for good. If there is a crooked line in this world then there must be a straight line. If there is a straight line then there must be God."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I don't sympathize with Suzie at all. The whole point of this video is that she's silly and clueless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a standard for good: does it cause me or others harm? If not, it's good. If it does, it's bad. I don't need a god to define this for me; humans are the yardstick. The existence of straight and crooked lines do not imply the existence of intent, but only that there are lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video also gives a very limited picture of God's presence in Suzie's life, said Geisler, who is a Christian apologist and philosopher. When it comes to Suzie's recovery from sickness, for example, the video fails to acknowledge that God is the one who designed her body with properties to heal naturally, said Geisler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BECAUSE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT A GOD DESIGNED HER BODY. Jebus, he&amp;#39;s a philosopher…you&amp;#39;d think he&amp;#39;d be competent to recognize a circular argument when he saw one. There are alternative explanations with evidence in their support for the presence of self-repair mechanisms in evolved organisms, you know, so just point to the fact that someone can heal is not automatic evidence for the existence of a magic man in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of this article at the Christian Post is "Atheist Depicts Christians as Delusional". Yeah?

&lt;p&gt;Tuataras are very interesting animals: endemic to New Zealand, and the sole survivors of an ancient and once more widespread order of reptiles, the Sphenodontida, whose closest relatives are the squamates (lizards+snakes). I noted some of their distinctive traits in an &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/tuataras-in-the-news/"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;. When a friend went to New Zealand for a visit during the holidays, I asked him to get a picture of a tuatara if one came his way, and he obliged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26936" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/tuataras-and-the-species-problem/tuataraab1/"&gt;&lt;img title="Tuatara at a North Island, NZ, zoo." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tuataraab1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuatara at a North Island, NZ, zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuataras are also of interest with regard to the ” species problem”, which Jerry recently addressed with respect to how many&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/02/how-many-species-of-elephant/"&gt; species of elephants&lt;/a&gt; there are (with follow-ups &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/more-on-species-part-1/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/more-on-species-part-2/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Ernst Mayr &lt;a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/167/3/1041"&gt;defined species in 1942 as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition, known as the biological species concept, is the one Jerry argued in favor of in his posts (and more extensively in &lt;em&gt;Speciation&lt;/em&gt;, his book with Allan Orr). Through most of the 20th century, a single geographically variable species of tuatara, &lt;em&gt;Sphenodon punctatus&lt;/em&gt;, was recognized. In 1990, on the basis of morphological and, primarily, allozyme differences, Charles Daugherty and colleagues argued that a second species,&lt;em&gt; S. guntheri&lt;/em&gt;, occurring on islands in eastern Cook Strait (see map), should be recognized. (&lt;a href="http://www.ableweb.org/volumes/vol-19/2-bader.pdf"&gt;Allozymes &lt;/a&gt;are proteins which are different alleles at the same genetic locus, and which are usually distinguished by protein electrophoresis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:453px"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26955" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/tuataras-and-the-species-problem/north_island_map_tuatara/"&gt;&lt;img title="Distribution of tuataras." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/north_island_map_tuatara.png?w=443&amp;amp;h=611" alt="" width="443" height="611"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distribution of tuataras, from Wikipedia. Circles, Sphenodon punctatus; squares, Sphenodon guntheri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, this bothered me, as I saw it as an application of the old morphological species concept, extended to genetic data: if you can tell them apart, they are different species. This is also what Jerry argued against in the case of elephants: an arbitrary amount of morphological or genetic difference, or inferred time of separation based on the amount of genetic difference, is not a sound basis for a species concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently (2010), however , further studies of tuataras have been made, including study of their DNA, and the authors of this work conclude that, as had been held earlier, a single geographically varying extant species of tuatara should be recognized (the status of the extinct tuataras from the New Zealand mainland is still up in the air). So we’re back to &lt;em&gt;S. punctatus&lt;/em&gt; as the sole surviving species in the Sphenodontida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turnaround in tuatara taxonomy is also a nice example of something Jerry considered in a &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/nobodys-perfect/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;: scientists changing their mind in the light of new evidence, and not being shy about saying so (something which, of course, should not be rare). Two of the authors of the 1990 resurrection of &lt;em&gt;S. guntheri,&lt;/em&gt; Charles Daugherty and &lt;a href="http://awcmee.massey.ac.nz/project_JHay.htm"&gt;Jennifer Hay&lt;/a&gt;, are also authors of its 2010 sinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to sample more things tuatara, Hillary Miller, a post-doc at the &lt;a href="http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/about/about.htm"&gt;Allan Wilson Centre           for Molecular Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand, has been running, unbeknownst to me at the time of my initial post, an interesting &lt;a href="http://chickenoreggblog.wordpress.com/tag/tuatara/"&gt;series of posts on tuataras&lt;/a&gt; at her blog, &lt;a href="http://chickenoreggblog.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Chicken or the Egg&lt;/a&gt;.  (&lt;a href="http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/wilson.html"&gt;Allan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/about/aboutAllanWilson.htm"&gt;Wilson&lt;/a&gt; a New Zealander who was a graduate student and later professor at Berkeley, was a pioneer in the application of biochemistry to evolutionary questions.)

He gave a wonderful talk which will be available online sometime in the near future. Here is an essay he wrote that goes right along with what he said, called &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/belief_engine"&gt;The Belief Engine&lt;/a&gt;. It's a must read. &lt;blockquote&gt;The true critical thinker accepts what few people ever accept — that one cannot routinely trust perceptions and memories. Figments of our imagination and reflections of our emotional needs can often interfere with or supplant the perception of truth and reality. Experience is often a poor guide to reality. Skepticism helps us to question our experience and to avoid being too readily led to believe what is not so. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6493400071279553142?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some people have sworn by the power of Bounce dryer sheets—and   specifically Bounce, too—to keep mosquitoes away from them, and gnats   out of their garden. Now scientists have proven the power of fluffy   white sheets as an insect repellent.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/5380427971/"&gt;&lt;img title="screen shot" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5044/5380427971_745696f27f_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="103"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifehacker wasn’t the only media group that picked up on this story; and pretty much all of them made the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at the actual research paper, what you see is that some of what was reported was correct.  There actually WAS a &lt;a href="http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/cgi/content/full/45/12/1830?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;amp;author1=Cloyd&amp;amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;paper that examined the repellency of Bounce dryer sheets&lt;/a&gt; to insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond A. Cloyd, et al. (2010). Bounce® Fabric Softener Dryer Sheets Repel Fungus Gnat, &lt;em&gt;Bradysia&lt;/em&gt; sp. nr. &lt;em&gt;coprophila&lt;/em&gt; (Diptera: Sciaridae), Adults.  HortScience, 45, 1830-1833&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
There is a very large difference between a fungus gnat and a mosquito.   That’s rather like reporting that the care and feeding of cats and  humans are interchangeable. Since, you know, we’re all mammals, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with what a fungus gnat is, and when you’d be likely to encounter them.  Basically, &lt;a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2114.html"&gt;fungus gnats&lt;/a&gt; don’t bite. They just annoy.  They’re likely to be the tiny things  flitting around the soil of your potted plants.  They can be a  commercial pest in greenhouses, but generally they are just a nuisance.  They breed in moist soil and nibble on roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone knows what mosquitoes are–a biting fly that can carry &lt;a href="http://www.mosquito.org/mosquito-information/mosquito-borne.aspx"&gt;major human diseases&lt;/a&gt;. They breed in water and adult females require a blood meal from a host to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not. The. Same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important difference, and it is a difference that has  human health implications. If you go out in an area where there are  disease-carrying mosquitoes with just a pocket full of dryer sheets as  your protection, you are taking a risk with your health.  Media make mistakes covering science news all the time–but in this  case, it’s a taxonomic mistake that could  (OK, in &lt;em&gt;THEORY&lt;/em&gt;, anyway)  literally cost someone their  life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve impressed upon you what’s at stake, let’s look at the actual experiment, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors tested the repellency of the dryer sheets in a &lt;a title="Image of the test apparatus" href="http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/vol45/issue12/images/large/1830fig1.jpeg"&gt;very controlled situation&lt;/a&gt;,  and were successful at reducing the number of fungus gnats in test  chambers containing a dryer sheet.  At the end of their paper there is  this caveat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, there are still important issues that need  to be resolved, including the residual effects (based on age of dryer  sheets) and effective distance of repellency, response in a no-choice  situation (if dryer sheets are placed into each petri dish), impact on  fungus gnat larval populations,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and ultimately plant damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, every scientific paper ends this way. Here’s what we did, and here’s how it’s uncovered a whole host of &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; questions for us to answer! Continued employment, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I, as a gardener, would draw from this experiment is that it  certainly couldn’t hurt to put a Bounce fabric sheet near my potted  plants, if I happened to have a fabric sheet laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I would not, in a bajilion years, jump to the conclusion that it would protect me from all biting insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This informal gathering of atheists and Christians started as a dialogue between Metroplex Atheist member Julio Rosario and 1st Baptist Church Pastor Marty Atkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the gathering is for members of each group to talk to each other about belief in God or the lack of belief in God. People from both groups will have the opportunity to ask and answer questions and to voice their opinions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is the type of outreach both sides need to have more of — it’s not a debate; it’s just dialogue.  And if a few stereotypes go by the wayside as a result of all this, then all the better for those involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event takes place on February 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; at First Baptist Church of Bedford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look at the actual research paper, what you see is that some of what was reported was correct.  There actually WAS a &lt;a href="http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/cgi/content/full/45/12/1830?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;amp;author1=Cloyd&amp;amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;paper that examined the repellency of Bounce dryer sheets&lt;/a&gt; to insects.&lt;span style="float:right;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img style="border:0" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raymond A. Cloyd, et al. (2010). Bounce® Fabric Softener Dryer Sheets Repel Fungus Gnat, &lt;em&gt;Bradysia&lt;/em&gt; sp. nr. &lt;em&gt;coprophila&lt;/em&gt; (Diptera: Sciaridae), Adults.&lt;br&gt;
HortScience, 45, 1830-1833&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
There is a very large difference between a fungus gnat and a mosquito.  That’s rather like reporting that the care and feeding of cats and humans are interchangeable. Since, you know, we’re all mammals, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with what a fungus gnat is, and when you’d be likely to encounter them.&lt;br&gt;
Basically, &lt;a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2114.html"&gt;fungus gnats&lt;/a&gt; don’t bite. They just annoy.  They’re likely to be the tiny things flitting around the soil of your potted plants.  They can be a commercial pest in greenhouses, but generally they are just a nuisance. They breed in moist soil and nibble on roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone knows what mosquitoes are–a biting fly that can carry &lt;a href="http://www.mosquito.org/mosquito-information/mosquito-borne.aspx"&gt;major human diseases&lt;/a&gt;. They breed in water and adult females require a blood meal from a host to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not. The. Same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important difference, and it is a difference that has human health implications. If you go out in an area where there are disease-carrying mosquitoes with just a pocket full of dryer sheets as your protection, you are taking a risk with your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media make mistakes covering science news all the time–but in this case, it’s a taxonomic mistake that could literally cost someone their life.  (Ok, I’m overstating it a bit. But, in THEORY, I’m right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve impressed upon you what’s at stake, let’s look at the actual experiment, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors tested the repellency of the dryer sheets in a &lt;a title="Image of the test apparatus" href="http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/vol45/issue12/images/large/1830fig1.jpeg"&gt;very controlled situation&lt;/a&gt;, and were successful at reducing the number of fungus gnats in test chambers containing a dryer sheet.  At the end of their paper there is this caveat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, there are still important issues that need to be resolved, including the residual effects (based on age of dryer sheets) and effective distance of repellency, response in a no-choice situation (if dryer sheets are placed into each petri dish), impact on fungus gnat larval populations,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and ultimately plant damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, every scientific paper ends this way. Here’s what we did, and here’s how it’s uncovered a whole host of &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; questions for us to answer! Continued employment, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I, as a gardener, would draw from this experiment is that it certainly couldn’t hurt to put a Bounce fabric sheet near my potted plants, if I happened to have a fabric sheet laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I would not, in a bajilion years, jump to the conclusion that it would protect me from all biting insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow’s show will be an interview with the inspirational &lt;strong&gt;Alan Conradi&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://westernsydneyfreethinkers.blogspot.com/"&gt;Western Sydney Freethinkers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://criticalmasspodcast.blogspot.com/"&gt;Critical Mass podcast&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/3-Thinkers/121099797928044"&gt;Three Thinkers podcast&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.sydneyatheists.org/"&gt;Sydney Atheists&lt;/a&gt;. A really fascinating discussion with an incredibly proactive guy, so I hope you enjoy it when it comes out on the Token Skeptic on Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly – go check out the blog-post ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidwaldock.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/how-discourse-about-homeopathy-was-affected-by-the-1023-campaign-a-case-study-in-public-engagement/"&gt;How Discourse About Homeopathy Was Affected By The 10:23 Campaign: A Case Study In Public Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘ – apparently there was some inspiration via a Token Skeptic podcast episode (‘&lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/05/01/episode-eighteen-on-the-placebo-protest-skepticism-and-communication-part-three/"&gt;The Placebo Protest&lt;/a&gt;‘) with Michael McRae and Desiree Schell! Thanks David Waldock! In addition, Daniel Loxton has written about Desiree’s resources as well, over at SkepticBlogs – ‘&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2011/01/18/anatomy-of-an-activist-stunt/"&gt;Anatomy Of An Activist Stunt&lt;/a&gt;‘.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing of Desiree attending Science Online 2011, I also highly recommend the blog entry at Context and Variation: &lt;a href="http://professorkateclancy.blogspot.com/2011/01/science-online-2011-even-when-we-want.html"&gt;“Science Online 2011: Even when we want something, we need to hide it”&lt;/a&gt;, about women in science and the attitudes against them when they work towards being recognised. It features a very interesting link to another article about &lt;a href="http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Society-Career-Power/Why-Women-Don-t-Say-They-Are-Ambitious/Leslie-Bennetts-Interviews-Women-with-Power"&gt;women and ambition too&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“There’s this attitude that if you’re a girl, there’s a limit on how much success you’re allowed…When I was nominated for a major award, the friends of another candidate went around telling people that they shouldn’t vote for me because I already had ‘too much’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manchester&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.qedcon.org/"&gt;QEDCon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ll be arriving in Manchester for this particular event – I’ll be in the city from the 4-6th February – and I’m &lt;a href="http://www.qedcon.org/schedule/"&gt;scheduled to be on stage for the first day&lt;/a&gt;, as a part of a panel on ‘Reaching Out Reasonably’. This will be with Eugenie Scott, Sile Land, David Kirby and moderated by Janis Bennion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, since it’s the weekend of the &lt;a href="http://www.1023.org.uk/"&gt;10:23 Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, there’ll be coordinated activities world-wide that will be recognised at the convention – including Australia in my absence! &lt;a href="http://tokenskeptic.org/ten23/"&gt;All the teams in Australia feature on the Token Skeptic podcast page&lt;/a&gt;, so head to the respective links to join in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few things planned during the two days that I’ll be in London, but they’ll primarily involve visiting the &lt;a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/apru/"&gt;Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmith’s College.&lt;/a&gt; Some of the inspirational research that I’ve read over the past few years herald from this institution, so it’s a great chance to get to see what it’s like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after QEDCon, I’ll be attending the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://westminster.skepticsinthepub.org/"&gt;Westminster Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on 7 February 2011 – &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/DrEvanHarris"&gt;Dr EvanHarris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/markgfh"&gt;Mark Henderson&lt;/a&gt; are going to be talking about a forthcoming book, “The Geek Manifesto”. So, if you’re in the London area and planning on a great discussion about science and politics, you might catch me there too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might have some free time in the morning of the 8th, but it depends on how busy I am with everything else before heading home at some odd early hour on the 9th. But if you’re planning to enjoy QEDCon or attend the Westminster Skeptics lecture, that’s what’s happening with me. &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;  As always, I’ll be travel-blogging while on the road and collecting audio for the &lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;Token Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; podcast and the &lt;a href="http://youngausskeptics.libsyn.com/the-pseudo-scientists-episode-27"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics podcast.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that vertical white plume in the background? That’s the vapor trail from Thursday’s launch of a monster Delta IV rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in southern California. It was carrying a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office — that is, a spy sat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How cool would it be to see something like that out your window? He took &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/CA8JQ"&gt;a series of pictures of the launch&lt;/a&gt;, all showing the twisting trail as the rocket took the satellite to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen three rocket launches up close in my life: one was an Delta that happened to go up while I was in Florida, another was the Space Shuttle carrying a camera I worked on up to Hubble, and the very first one I ever saw — get this — was a Saturn V ...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295789317653"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6963988504798624614">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15fda7a29539cf5a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Culture" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Inciting Hatred</title><published>2011-01-23T13:01:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-23T13:01:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2011/01/inciting-hatred.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;This video is making the rounds. I'm including it here because so many people have been discussing "civility" and "politeness" in the wake of the Tuscon mass killing. In my opinion, it's not lack of civility that's the problem. The problem arises when you start treating your opponents as anti-American and unpatriotic and their ideas as illegitimate (not just a difference of opinion). That's when it becomes reasonable to consider using force to prevent your enemy from destroying the country. You are protecting America against dictatorial traitors and that's exactly what reasonable citizens should do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glen Beck is a master of this technique. He should not be surprised if some of his followers jump to the obvious conclusion.

&lt;p&gt;His time was up, was all.  He had developed a neurological condition that made it difficult for him to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things about owning animals is that most -- dogs, cats, horses and all -- don&amp;#39;t live as long as people, and sometimes responsible people have to make the decision to end the animal&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was still bright and interacting while we hung out with him this morning, feeding him carrots and peppermint treats.  The vet came, and fed him more peppermint treats as she administered an anti-anxiety drug, and then an overdose of sedatives.  He was still mouthing peppermints as he folded up and went on to the next thing, whatever that might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euthanizing him was the right decision. Horses don&amp;#39;t fear death.  I don&amp;#39;t think they conceptualize death.  But they do fear predators, and it must be awful to be a horse, whose only real defense is to run away, and be unable to run.  I don&amp;#39;t think he had fearful moments, this last week, but it was only a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really sad.  Not only was he a noble horse, he was part of a number of stories, all completed now.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite having constant internet access and the ability to shop online for books 24/7, I appreciate the experience of physically browsing books in the store, because I often find things I never would have thought to look for online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/images.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/images.jpeg" alt="" title="images" width="225" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced out in the featured hardcover section, was &lt;em&gt;Anarchy Evolution: Faith, Science, and Bad Religion in a World without God&lt;/em&gt; by Greg Graffin and Steve Olson.  My first thought was, “Wow, that’s kind of a stupid title.  Anarchy Evolution?  What is that even supposed to mean?”  So, I picked it up to find out.  Turns out Greg Graffin is the lead singer of the punk band Bad Religion (which, having led a rather sheltered childhood, musically and otherwise, I didn’t know, and hadn’t heard).  He’s also an evolutionary biologist.  Cool, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the jacket, this book seemed right up my alley:  An examination of science through the eyes of an artist.  So I bought it, and the next day, I read the whole thing.  Not necessarily because it was earth shattering or ridiculously engaging (it was neither, but more on that in a moment), but because it had been so long since I’d dedicated an entire day to just reading a book.  When I finished, I placed it on the shelf with a highly satisfying sense of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book was alright.  The writing immediately struck me as being intended for a young, scientifically illiterate audience.  It meanders between explanations of scientific ideas and memoirs of experiences in Graffin’s music career that formed or complemented them.  His ego comes through in a vaguely annoying, grandiose tone that he never lives up to with his use of overly simplistic language or the relative superficiality of his intellectual examinations.  I often found myself nodding in agreement with his experiences and conclusions, but I never found myself captivated or challenged by an angle of inquiry I’d yet to consider.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a book for the well read, discerning student of science and philosophy.  Why mention it at all?  Well, I think it’s a very useful book, and it fills a unique niche that lines up squarely with the goals of skeptical outreach:  It translates science into a language that people who aren’t generally interested in science can understand, and it packages it and markets it in a way that will undoubtedly reach a lot of people who aren’t reading about science elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is perfectly aimed at disaffected youth.  It’s calibrated to channel anarchical impulses and contrarian leanings from mere emotional positions into a well honed, well considered, naturalistic worldview; to begin to mold a hatred for authority into a love for the workings of the  universe.  Or at least to try to get people started along that path.  And for that, it’s kind of brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

Enjoy.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My first question is which Christ I’m supposed to talk about tonight. There have been many of them in Judeo-Christian communities. Before Jesus there was King Zerubbabel (6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century BCE). Many others since then have arisen, including Simon bar Kokhba (2&lt;sup&gt;ND&lt;/sup&gt; Century CE), the Gnostic Christ, down to &lt;i&gt;Jose de Jesus&lt;/i&gt; who lives today in Houston, Texas. If this same discussion were taking place in India we would talk about Krishna, who is regarded as the eighth incarnation of lord Vishnu. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to raise awareness of the fact that the culturally dominant view of Christ by Christians should not get a free pass to the table merely because it’s held by the majority of people. It must earn its right to be here by showing it has more evidence than other Christ conceptions do. My claim is that all religious conceptions of Christ share something in common with each other. They all share in a faith-based reasoning as opposed to a science-based reasoning. Because of this they cannot convince each other that other Christ conceptions are false. Only if they can find a way to arrive at a consensus between them can we take any of them seriously, regardless of which one is the culturally dominant view. But they cannot do this. The failure of these religionists to settle their disputes shows us the failure of faith-based reasoning. The only way out of such a religious morass is to reject faith-based reasoning in favor of science-based reasoning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Faith-based Reasoning.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Faith-based reasoning begins with one’s upbringing, primarily coming from parents, but also from the culture at large. We’re all raised as believers. We initially believe whatever our parents tell us in our respective cultures. Since our parents were never told differently by their parents that there is no Christ they don’t pass that on to their children. For this reason doubt is an adult attitude. It must be learned. 2)  Faith-based reasoning begins with a faith position and seeks to confirm it. It reasons from faith rather than to faith and surprise, it finds faith reasonable. But we know from psychological studies that most people who seek to confirm something can find reasons to do so. So there is a good reason to avoid this as much as possible and instead be skeptical of beliefs we prefer to be true. 3) Faith-based reasoning always takes a leap beyond what the probabilities show us. There is no way any reasonable person can conclude any more than what the probabilities show us. Even if the probabilities of something stand at 51% no reasonable person should bridge that gap with a faith that provides certainty. That leap is always epistemologically unjustified. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science-based Reasoning.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Science-based reasoning begins by looking for hard evidence for what to accept as true. Given the fact that various sects of religious faith believe and defend what they were raised to believe, and that most of them are certain about their faith I must demand evidence, hard evidence, positive evidence, before I’ll accept what any of them believe. Until one of them steps up to the plate and offers something more by way of evidence than the other faiths do I cannot believe in any of them for the same reasons. 2) Science-based reasoning has a tried and true method that assumes a natural explanation for every phenomenon. This method has produced the goods down through the centuries. 3) Science-based reasoning only accepts what the probabilities show us. It does not go beyond them.&lt;br&gt;Clearly then, faith-based reasoning should be rejected in favor of science-based reasoning. We need objective evidence, a lot of it, when it comes to extraordinary claims. When applied specifically to the extraordinary Christian claims about Christ I’ll argue they should be rejected because they are not probable at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Christ.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meaning of the word “Christ” is “anointed one,” from the Hebrew word for “Messiah.” Prophets, priests and kings were publicly anointed with oil to their divinely authorized roles. Christians claim that Jesus is uniquely the &lt;i&gt;Anointed One&lt;/i&gt; because he fulfilled these three roles perfectly, all wrapped up into one. Christians believe that Jesus is the Christ as God’s incarnate Son on earth who spoke God’s final words to a small group of ancient, pre-scientific Middle Eastern people, who had to die to save the world from sin because God just could not forgive us without it, who arose from the grave but was only seen by a small number of people, some of whom doubted, and who forever rules over the world even though he’s not doing a very good job of this. Now he demands that we believe these extraordinary claims and if we don’t, we’ll be punished in hell when we die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any questions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I have plenty of them and not enough time. I like to address the larger questions too, because they help us with the proper context when looking into the specifics of any particular extraordinary claim coming from Christian believers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important question is this one: &lt;b&gt;Where’s the evidence?&lt;/b&gt; Bertrand Russell was asked what he would tell God on judgment day as to why he did not believe. Russell reportedly said: “Not enough evidence, God, not enough evidence.” That’s what I would say, because even if the Christian faith ends up being true after all there is still no reason thinking people should accept it. We can only accept claims that can be reasonably justified. That means we have to reject a lot of true claims because they have not met their own burden of proof. This is both obvious and non-controversial. Aliens from space might have abducted someone, but without sufficient evidence commensurate with that claim there is no reason why anyone should believe the person who asserts it. There are surely cases in which someone murdered another person but no one suspects he did the evil deed, because there is just no evidence that leads anyone to think he did. There are many hundreds of claims that we should never believe, even if they are true. That’s the case when it comes to Christianity. Even if it’s true, thinking people cannot accept it because there isn’t enough evidence to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Christian claims are all so very extraordinary, especially when grouped together as a whole, that they seem bizarre to an outsider. Someone not already raised to believe them would find it extremely difficult to even entertain them at all. Since I’m a thinking person I cannot accept just any claim at all. I am right to require reasonable answers to basic questions, and I am right to require sufficient evidence commensurate with the claims being made before I will accept them. I can see no reasonable objection to this requirement at all. Even if there is a god he supposedly created me this way as a thinking person. So the existence of a god changes nothing, for it would be duplicitous and counter-productive of a deity to create me as a thinking person and not also provide me with the answers and the evidence that a thinking person needs to accept the Christian claims. That is why casting a critical thinking non-believer to hell because God just did not provide enough evidence to believe these extraordinary claims is contrary to what we would expect from a good reasonable God, and an additional reason to reject them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians must show that the biblically described events actually happened in the past. But this task is fatally hamstrung by virtue of the fact that such efforts are based upon the poor quality of historical evidence that survives from the ancient superstitious past. Usually the farther we go back in the past the harder it is to reconstruct exactly what happened. Many historical reconstructions are weakly justified because that’s the best historians can do with the paucity of evidence for them. Sometimes the evidence leading to a different conclusion has been lost, or destroyed. In most circumstances historians can at best only say what did not happen as they falsify one historical supposition after another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we factor in claims of miracles in the ancient past it gets even worse. Believers must meet an almost impossible double burden of proof. For a miraculous event must be both very improbable and probable at the same time. In order to argue an event is miraculous the Christian apologist must show that such an event is exceedingly improbable. But then the apologist must turn right around and claim this same exceedingly improbable event took place anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case in my world miracles do not happen. What world are YOU living in? Christians cannot believe without historical evidence and yet they must approach said evidence from our present day perspective. The only way they can reach their historical conclusions is by assuming what needs to be shown based on their upbringing in a Christian culture and that's it. If in our world miracles do not happen then they did not happen in first century Palestine either. And that should be the end of it. So expecting this kind of solid evidence for miracles in the past is asking more of history than it’s possible to show from historical study. For instance, unlike a person who personally tells us he levitated we cannot interrogate an ancient text that says a certain person levitated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we’re not done yet. Christians must also show that the doctrines they derive from the supposed biblical events are true. However, this task is fatally hamstrung by virtue of the fact that their interpretations of the Biblical texts are historically situated and culturally conditioned, as is evident from the number of Christianities that have existed and exist today. Lastly, Christians have the task of showing how philosophy can make coherent sense of their doctrines, like Trinitarianism, the incarnation, atonement, personal identity after death, and the goodness of an omnipotent God in the presence of massive ubiquitous human and animal suffering. Accomplishing all of these Herculean tasks is needed to defend what they believe. It cannot be done. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reasonable Christian belief cannot even get off the ground because of the low odds of the historical evidence alone. When it comes to extraordinary miraculous claims, yesterday’s evidence has lost all of its power to convince. For in order to see yesterday’s evidence as convincing evidence for a miracle, we must already believe in an interpretive framework that allows us to see it as such. In the case of Christianity the raw uninterpreted data of the past will not be enough for us to believe a miracle took place without first having a Christian interpretive framework for that raw data. This is circular and a catch-22 for faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where does the Christian interpretive framework come from then? It doesn’t come from any “background knowledge” or “priors,” for there are no relevant “priors” prior to establishing the Christian interpretive framework. Christians must first independently establish that the miraculous resurrection of Jesus took place from the uninterpreted raw historical data. Not until then can they place such a miraculous belief into their bag of “priors” in first place! This problem is fatal for anyone who wishes to believe Jesus arose from the dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can even grant the existence of Yahweh, or a creator god, along with the possibility of miracles, and it changes very little. For what needs to be shown is that Yahweh did such a miracle here in this particular case, despite the fact that the historical tools we have available to assess whether he did this here in this particular case are inadequate for the task. After all, Jews do not believe Jesus arose from the dead even though they believe in Yahweh and miracles, because they don’t think the there is sufficient evidence to believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All we have is hearsay testimonial evidence coming from the ancient superstitious past containing inconsistencies and improbabilities on behalf of the resurrection of Jesus. We do not know who wrote the gospels. We do know they were written decades and more after the alleged facts supposedly occurred. How reliable of a testimony can that be? We also know there were many forgeries written by Christians, some of them accepted into the canonical New Testament. We cannot say all four canonical gospels are genuine. We cannot say they represent four separate testimonies since later canonical gospels borrowed from and expanded on the gospel of Mark, a gospel where the resurrected Jesus does not appear to the disciples at all? We can’t even say all the characters in them are real people. Much less we can’t claim to know what they actually said and did. We cannot interview them, or the gospel writers themselves. And even if we were to grant that the gospel writers reported some things correctly there are things we simply cannot believe. After all we’re told that at the death of Jesus the tombs of the saints opened and they walked around Jerusalem (Matthew 27:52-53). Why should we believe anything they said at that point? There is a reason why hearsay evidence is not admissible in court. It cannot be substantiated. This is even more exacerbated of a problem when it comes to the ancient superstitious past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tools of the historian are inadequate for the task of detecting miracles. The historian must be skeptical, must seek independent corroboration, must assume a natural cause for events in history, and must never claim more than the evidence allows. Historians &lt;i&gt;qua&lt;/i&gt; historians cannot use faith to establish their historical reconstructions, otherwise they could be easily duped by claims that witches flew through the night, or that a statue of Mary actually weeps, or that the sun really did stop dead in its tracks for Joshua. But the historian can say what probably did not happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It sure seems that if God exists he planted contrary evidence in the New Testament itself to make us doubt. We know there was no Star of Bethlehem that somehow moved over the manger of Jesus. We know there was no world-wide census at the time Jesus was supposedly born. There are good reasons to think King Herod did not massacre all boys under the age of two. There are some really good reasons to think the prophecies about Jesus are all concocted. Why should we believe the miraculous claims in the texts when there are historical claims in them that we know did not happen? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are there even genealogies in the Gospels? If Jesus’ royal lineage is to be traced back through Mary, as it’s claimed Luke does, then Mary was just the receptacle of God’s seed, contributing nothing. And if that’s so, how can Jesus legitimately be of the Davidic lineage? However, if Jesus’ royal lineage is to be traced back through Joseph, as it’s claimed Matthew does, and if Joseph was not the father, then we have the same problem. In either case, how can Jesus legitimately be of the Davidic lineage? On this problem, according to Paul Kurtz, “the Gospels are impaled on an irreconcilable contradiction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of a virgin birth was a common notion among some other ancient groups, including the Greeks and Romans. Many famous people and mythical heroes were said, by one group or another, to have been born of a virgin. Among them were Julius Caesar, Augustus, Alexander the Great, Plato, some of the Egyptian Pharaohs, the Buddha, Mithra, and Hercules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were also savior-gods, like Krishna, Osiris, Dionysus, and Tammuz, who were born of virgins and known to the Gospel writers centuries before. They also did miracles. Most of them were crucified, and they also arose from the dead. Justin Martyr was a second-century Christian apologist who tried to convince the pagans of his day of the truth of Christianity. In his First Apology Justin Martyr wrote, “And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was produced without sexual union, and that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. For you know how many sons your esteemed writers ascribed to Jupiter: Mercury…Bacchus . . . Hercules; and the sons of Leda. And what kind of deeds are recorded of each of these reputed sons of Jupiter, it is needless to tell to those who already know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’re told that the people on the island of Malta believed of Paul was a god (Acts 28:6), and the people of Lystra believed both Paul and Barnabas were gods who came down to them in human form (Acts 14:11). If the people in that ancient era could so easily believe such things then what confidence should we have when we’re told Jesus is the son of God? Many important people in the ancient world were regarded as such. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul the apostle claims to have been converted on the Damascus Road but when he told King Agrippa his story he said what he really experienced was just a vision (Acts 26:19). A vision is not considered an event in space and time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s claimed that Christ is our savior since he died for us. But isn’t it obvious there is no connection between punishment and forgiveness? And if Jesus satisfied God’s wrath for our sins then as the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; person of the trinity who or what can satisfy his wrath against our sins? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no Christ.

As far as I know, celiac disease is the only autoimmune disorder with a specific and identified trigger: the protein gluten.  It has also been pointed out that the incidence of Celiac Disease, the formal name for gluten-triggered autoimmune reactions in the bowel,  appears to have been increasing. Some have claimed that humans are not adapted to consumption of plant proteins like gluten, and that inflammatory bowel disorders are the result of the development of agriculture.     However, there are a few other possibilities.  One is that autoimmune disorders in general have been increasing and that Celiac disease is not increasing at a uniquely faster rate.  A major hypothesis in the development of allergies (inappropriate immune responses to non-pathogens, such as glutten or pollen or dog hair) is lack of exposure to potential allergens early in life.  This, perhaps, is the root of the problem: soap, lysol, and a generally high level of cleanliness.  Also, a huge change in human habit is the widespread introduction of infant formula to replace breast milk, and early introduction of other foods into infant diets.  The ideal window of exposure to gluten is now considered to be between 4 and 7 months and that exposure should be concurrent with continuing breast milk consumption. Introduction to wheat cereals during this period is thought to be protective against celiac disease.  Those raising their young children on gluten-free diets in the hope of protecting them from celiac disease, or the adverse effects of inflammation in general, may be taking the wrong route.  (See Pinier et al. 2010 and Lopez-Serrano et al. 2010).  Let them get a little dirtyAnother possiblity, proposed by Elliot and Weinstock (2009) is the current rarity of helminth infection in the Western World.  These authors propose that helminth infection was protective against autoimmune diseases like celiac disease by stimulating immune circuits that lower inflammation.   I suppose if one were to choose between a gluten-free diet and helminth infection, most would go with the gluten-free diet.  However, before you consider loss of bread as the price some pay for the protection of all against intestinal parasites, note that Elliot and Weinstock also propose exploration of the use of helminths for clinical treatment of auto-immune disease.

Jurassic Park beer:

Fossil Fuels Brewing Co. makes beer with an Eocene-era yeast, formerly encased in a 45 million year old chunk of amber! Incredible, but apparently true. Viable Bacillus spores were discovered first in 25-40 million year old amber by Raul Cano (these spores are so tough you can&amp;#39;t kill them with an autoclave). He then founded a startup (Ambergene) with the hopes of discovering ancient antibiotics (this was back during the natural products craze - when pharma companies sent explorers to coral reefs, rainforests and geothermal hot pools to find new biologically-active chemicals. Now, most just do combinatorial synthetic chemistry). The company failed, but when you can&amp;#39;t make money, make beer!    h/t: AncientFoods

Living off the land:

A reason to like kale:

Organisms can optimize their fitness by reproducing early when times are good and holding back and focusing on survival when times are bad (if your population is about to experience an involuntary bottleneck, offspring born afterwards will contribute proportionally more genes to the population). This Week in Evolution discusses the reproductive advantages that an organism would accrue if it could delay reproduction specifically in times of environmental stress.* In PLoS one, Will Ratcliff cites examples of creatures from yeast to rats showing increased longevity (and delayed reproduction) when exposed to minor environmental stresses (calorie restriction, temperature stresses, low dose toxins).** They hypothesize that the consumption of &amp;quot;famine foods&amp;quot; (e.g. low calorie and nutrition and moderate toxicity) would be an effective cue for an organism to switch to survival mode.&amp;quot;Plants high in insect-repelling toxins might be an example of such &amp;quot;famine foods&amp;quot;, even if some modern humans have developed a taste for kale, coffee, or hot peppers. These plant toxins might have small negative effects on our health. But, if our bodies respond to the information carried by those toxins -- famine! population decline likely! delay reproduction! -- then those negative effects may be outweighed by the health benefits of setting our hormone levels etc. to values optimized for longevity rather than reproduction.&amp;quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been an innate sense among atheists that the Promethean quest to topple the gods demands a certain seriousness and humility of any who would undertake it. Hence those atheists worthy of the name often adopted austere, chastened, almost ascetic forms of life - one thinks especially of Nietzsche or Beckett, or even the iconic Lord Asriel of Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy - precisely because our disavowed idolatrous attachment manifest in practices and habits and cloying indulgences, and not simply in beliefs (this was Karl Marx's great observation about the "theological" dimension of Capital).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By comparison, the "New Atheists" look like sensationalist media-pimps: smugly self-assured, profligate, unphilosophical and brazenly ahistorical, whose immense popularity says rather more about the illiteracy and moral impoverishment of Western audiences than it does about the relative merits of their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, that makes it easy. Those New Atheists aren&amp;#39;t wizened mummies who whisper a few gnomic words of wisdom and then lie back to contemplate eternities — why, they strut confidently (how dare they!), they write a lot (how undignified!), and they engage vigorously with the popular culture (then they must be boorish louts). Nietzsche would kick their butts and Marx would shame them into silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree — these New Atheists are simply basing their ideas more strongly on science, something the theistic critics don&amp;#39;t seem to comprehend — and I don&amp;#39;t consider them &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; than the Old Atheists, just different, and even there, we're all making the same argument that gods don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings up the relevant point: Old Atheists and New Atheists don't disagree on the existence of gods, so isn't invoking both generations of atheists simply doubling your opposition? And if the New Atheists are such scrawny, flabby specimens, why aren't you simply clobbering us with those powerful arguments you developed to crush our predecessors? Oh, is it because you never had any crushing arguments of that sort?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Stephens has made no counter-argument to atheism at all, except to name-drop an assortment of atheists he thinks were more "serious" in his opinion than any contemporary atheists who would bother to disagree with him. That says nothing about atheism, but much about his own inadequacies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same nonsense that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/05/the_eagleton_delusion.php"&gt;Terry Eagleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/04/that_hollow_ring_that_tired_ob.php"&gt;David Hart&lt;/a&gt;, among many others, have tried to pull off, and it simply doesn't work.

This is the problem of incidental findings on MRI scans.An &amp;quot;incidental finding&amp;quot; is when you scan someone&amp;#39;s brain for research purposes, and, unexpectedly, notice that something looks wrong with it. This is surprisingly common: estimates range from 2–8% of the general population. It will happen to you if you regularly use MRI or fMRI for research purposes, and when it does, it&amp;#39;s a shock. Especially when the brain in question belongs to someone you know. Friends, family and colleagues are often the first to be recruited for MRI studies.This is why it&amp;#39;s vital to have a system in place for dealing with incidental findings. Any responsible MRI scanning centre will have one, and as a researcher you ought to be familiar with it. But what system is best?Broadly speaking there are two extreme positions:Research scans are not designed for diagnosis, and 99% of MRI researchers are not qualified to make a diagnosis. What looks &amp;quot;abnormal&amp;quot; to Joe Neuroscientist BSc or even Dr Bob Psychiatrist is rarely a sign of illness, and likewise they can easily miss real diseases. So, we should ignore incidental findings, pretend the scan never happened, because for all clinical purposes, it didn&amp;#39;t.You have to do whatever you can with an incidental finding. You have the scans, like it or not, and if you ignore them, you&amp;#39;re putting lives at risk. No, they&amp;#39;re not clinical scans, they can still detect many diseases. So all scans should be examined by a qualified neuroradiologist, and any abnormalities which are possibly pathological should be followed-up.Neither of these extremes is very satisfactory. Ignoring incidental findings sounds nice and easy, until you actually have to do it, especially if it&amp;#39;s your girlfriend&amp;#39;s brain. On the other hand, to get every single scan properly checked by a neuroradiologist would be expensive and time-consuming. Also, it would effectively turn your study into a disease screening program - yet we know that screening programs can cause more harm than good, so this is not necessarily a good idea.Most places adopt a middle-of-the-road approach. Scans aren&amp;#39;t routinely checked by an expert, but if a researcher spots something weird, they can refer the scan to a  qualified clinician to follow up. Almost always, there&amp;#39;s no underlying disease. Even large, OMG-he-has-a-golf-ball-in-his-brain findings can be benign. But not always.This is fine but it doesn&amp;#39;t always work smoothly. The details are everything. Who&amp;#39;s the go-to expert for your study, and what are their professional obligations? Are they checking your scan &amp;quot;in a personal capacity&amp;quot;, or is this a formal clinical referral? What&amp;#39;s their e-mail address? What format should you send the file in? If they&amp;#39;re on holiday, who&amp;#39;s the backup? At what point should you inform the volunteer about what&amp;#39;s happening?Like fire escapes, these things are incredibly boring, until the day when they&amp;#39;re suddenly not.A new paper from the University of California Irvine describes a computerized system that made it easy for researchers to refer scans to a neuroradiologist. A secure website was set up and publicized in University neuroscience community.Suspect scans could be uploaded, in one of two common formats. They were then anonymized and automatically forwarded to the Department of Radiology for an expert opinion. Email notifications kept everyone up to date with the progress of each scan.This seems like a very good idea, partially because of the technical advantages, but also because of the &amp;quot;placebo effect&amp;quot; - the fact that there&amp;#39;s an electronic system in place sends the message: we&amp;#39;re serious about this, please use this system.Out about 5,000 research scans over 5 years, there were 27 referrals. Most were deemed benign... except one which turned out to be potentially very serious - suspected hydrocephalus, increased fluid pressure in the brain, which prompted an urgent referral to hospital for further tests.There&amp;#39;s no ideal solution to the problem of incidental findings, because by their very nature, research scans are kind of clinical and kind of not. But this system seems as good as any.Cramer SC, Wu J, Hanson JA, Nouri S, Karnani D, Chuang TM, &amp;amp; Le V (2011). A system for addressing incidental findings in neuroimaging research.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Nickell is one of the world’s most prominent skeptical investigators of the paranormal. He has researched numerous historical, paranormal, and forensic mysteries, myths and hoaxes, including hauntings, crop circles, UFOs, psychic claims, the Shroud of Turin, and the purported diary of Jack the Ripper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe is a Senior Research Fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and writes the Investigative Files column for Skeptical Inquirer magazine. He is the author of many books, such as Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal, Secrets of the Sideshows and Real or Fake: Studies in Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interview with Karen Stollznow, Joe discusses his areas of expertise, and why investigation is an important and necessary part of skepticism. He talks about whether anyone can investigate the paranormal, and shares some of the mistakes made by investigators; not only paranormal investigators, but also skeptical paranormal investigators. Joe mentions some advances in the area of investigation, and the pros and cons of recreating paranormal claims versus trying to capture paranormal phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people know Joe as an investigator, however, there are many surprising sides to him. He speaks about his many careers, and how he infuses skepticism into all of his roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cuomo and our poor monkey brains&lt;/a&gt;", it was &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2918#comment-104773"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that some examples of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004716.html"&gt;misnegation&lt;/a&gt; translate into Russian, French, and Spanish. This observation deserves a post of its own, since it helps us to distinguish among &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813"&gt;the possible explanations for the phenomena in question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on French first, we observe some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=devons+sous-estimer&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=#q=%22peut%7Cpouvons%7Cpouvoir+pas+sous-estimer%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;prmd=ivns&amp;amp;ei=1eo6TcftDYLKgQf_tMjBCA&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;fp=1&amp;amp;cad=b"&gt;equivalents&lt;/a&gt; of "cannot be underestimated":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;On ne peut pas sous-estimer l&amp;#39;importance d&amp;#39;enseigner les langues aux enfants …&lt;br&gt;
Nous ne pouvons pas sous-estimer l'importance des petites entreprises dans notre économie régionale.&lt;br&gt;
On ne peut pas sous-estimer l’importance et l’impact d’un bon titre.&lt;br&gt;
Le travail des migrants (rotation du personnel) joue un rôle qu'on ne peut pas sous-estimer.&lt;br&gt;
Néanmoins, nous ne pouvons pas sous estimer la complexité du problème et la nécessité de le résoudre graduellement, systématiquement, mais seulement sur la base de prémisses strictement objectives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Quel que soit le rôle du vécu dans le Capital, rôle que sans doute on ne pourrait pas sous-estimer, le vécu n'est cependant jamais constitutif.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern seems to be &lt;a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=peut+pas+sous+-+estimer&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=7&amp;amp;smoothing=3"&gt;somewhat less common in French&lt;/a&gt; than in English, but still far from rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000500.html"&gt;Fail to miss&lt;/a&gt;" also has some Francophone echoes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — no it doesn&amp;#39;t; or at least the examples that I found actually mean &amp;quot;nearly miss&amp;quot;, as Coby Lubliner explains below…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1924"&gt;no head injury is too trivial to be ignored&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;?  I wasn&amp;#39;t able to find anything directly comparable — all the examples that I turned up were like these, where things line up in the right direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;Aucun détail n'est trop insignifiant pour être contrôlé.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first year, the award went to &lt;strong&gt;Salman Rushdie&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second award went to lead singer of Bad Religion, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/02/26/what-do-salman-rushdie-and-the-lead-singer-of-bad-religion-have-in-common/"&gt;Greg Graffin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next went to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/04/13/joss-whedon-on-humanism/"&gt;Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, it went to &lt;em&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/em&gt;‘ &lt;strong&gt;Adam Savage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Hyneman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this year, the award will be going to actor and comedian &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=148:hch-presents-stephen-fry&amp;amp;catid=6:latest-news&amp;amp;Itemid=38"&gt;Stephen Fry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=148:hch-presents-stephen-fry&amp;amp;catid=6:latest-news&amp;amp;Itemid=38"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.harvardhumanist.org/images/stories/stephen_fry_100.jpg2.jpg" width="184" height="275"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which I say… meh.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure he’s funny and wonderful and all, but I’m just not very familiar with him. (&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: Whoa, people. I didn’t say he didn’t deserve it. I just said I wasn’t familiar with him. Of course I could look him up. That’s besides the point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the committee &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/28/who-should-win-harvards-outstanding-lifetime-achievement-award-in-cultural-humanism/"&gt;tried really hard&lt;/a&gt; to get a wide range of nominees — Remember, this isn’t just about picking someone; the person must also be willing to accept the award in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the pressure’s really on for the Humanist Chaplaincy to find a woman to give this award to next year.  Surely, there are many non-theistic women who both deserve to receive the title and would be honored to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fry will accept his award on Tuesday, February 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; at Harvard and &lt;a href="http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/cal/details.php?ID=41975"&gt;tickets are available&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, maybe you all can tell me why he’s so amazing…&lt;br&gt;

And I&amp;#39;m talking waaaay back, when the Chlamydiae were much more innocent and hadn&amp;#39;t got into that whole sexually transmitted disease scene.In a Science article, Devos and Reynaud discuss the possibility that that The PVC bugs, which appear to be a monophyletic group forming their own &amp;quot;superphylum&amp;quot; are in fact the most likely candidates for the bacterial ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes. The evidence for this comes from the fact that some (but not all) PVC members share several features in common with eukaryotes, such as subcellular compartmentalisation,  and membrane bound DNA. Some of these features are also shared with archaea, such as loss of the FtsZ protein. PVC bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes also share another protein absense... but that will be discussed in one of our forthcoming papers. Of the PVC bacteria, Gemmata obscuriglobus is perhaps the most interesting. It surrounds its DNA in a membrane, reminiscent of the eukaryotic nucleus, and seems to undergo a process similar to endocytosis for uptake of extracellular material.  Devos and Reynaud suggest that the PVC bacteria are evolutionary intermediates on the road to eukaryotes and archaea, but as far as I know there is no phylogenomic evidence that suggests PVC bacteria are more closely related to eukaryotes and archaea than the rest of bacteria. Instead, I wonder whether these features are instead relics from LUCA, which as I mentioned in a previous post, might have been surprisingy complex and eukaryote-like. Could the lack of some of these features in other bacteria in fact be a derived, rather than ancestral state?Devos, D., &amp;amp; Reynaud, E. (2010).

I won't name it because I really just want to complain about a phenomenon I'm seeing a lot of in this whole genre, as much as I've read, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driving conflict of this story is supposed to be the horror of the undead: the protagonist is both tainted with the curse of partial undeadness and trying to protect friends from being similarly afflicted. This is a reasonable premise for a fantasy novel, and could make for a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one little problem. The taint (vampirism, in this case) makes the victim inhumanly strong, with lightning reflexes and acute senses, and also immortal and immune to mundane threats like bullets, poison, knives, and suffocation — decapitation and being burned to ash are the only serious threats (and granted, her enemies know this and are trying to chop her head off). Meanwhile, the traditional weaknesses of vampires — sunlight, garlic, wooden stakes, holy water, etc. — are all dismissed as superstitious misconceptions of the Middle Ages. They don&amp;#39;t affect her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it turns out, vampirism gives its victims a hypnotic glamor that makes them irresistible, and also an awesome sexual stamina. There is a cost, in that they have to drink blood, but it turns out that nipping a pint from a willing and enthusiastic partner once a week, preferably during the throes of orgasmic ecstasy, is enough to fuel all those superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm having a little difficulty getting into the story. Every time the protagonist moans about her curse and these evil, rotten vampires who must have their heads ripped off before they eat her baby sister or whoever, I'm thinking the story should be about getting this poor crazy woman into a mental hospital to address her self-esteem issues, and about how she should be joyfully trying to share her gift with her family and friends. It's very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a suggestion if you're writing one of these stories: could you either make the curse a real curse that generally puts one into an undesirable situation, or could you write a story about happy, enlightened, lucky people who are overjoyed at their amazing new abilities? 'Cause the whiny gripey moaney stuff over objectively glorious circumstances is gettin' old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/are_you_writing_a_vampire_nove.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/pCU9oFtN9JM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295712647899"><id gr:original-id="1128 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c5fe270db3a1429</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Fiction science: An interview with Tania Hershman</title><published>2011-01-22T14:31:20Z</published><updated>2011-01-22T14:31:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/1128" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Armed with a canvas bag brimming with vintage chemistry glassware, Tania Hershman looked like someone off to set up some insane experiment when I met up with her in Cotham last week.

He now insists that he is a supporter of evolution, a fact not in evidence in his &lt;a href="http://incolor.inetnebr.com/gaskell/Martin_Gaskell_Bible_Astronomy.html"&gt;writings about the field&lt;/a&gt;, and also not evident in his answers to his dodgy replies to specific questions in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real problem is his complete lack of any kind of scientific filter in his evaluation of the literature. This is a man more likely to cite a religious source to answer a question about biology than to refer to any of the scientific evidence; he gets his biology from Hugh Ross, Josh MacDowell, and Philip Johnson. He expresses his gullibility well in this interview; this comment made my jaw drop, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are your thoughts on the paradox between public universities needing to teach scientific fact and the fact that they receive government funding and thus are likely not allowed to discriminate on the basis of religious beliefs, which may contradict scientific fact (e.g. believers in the young earth premise)? (And I mean this in the sense that this debate could come up for a biology faculty position, in which your beliefs might actually affect what you are teaching.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Gaskell:&lt;/b&gt;
This HAS come up multiple times with biology positions. There is a good book covering this in great detail. It is called "Slaughter of the Dissidents" by Jerry Bergman. I'd highly recommend getting a copy to understand what goes on. The recurrent problem you'll find if you look at the cases documented in the book is that Christian biologists get fired or demoted not because of what they actually teach or do in their research, but because of who they are.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what I mean? He's citing Jerry &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/10/slaughter_in_st_paul_massacre.php"&gt;"Nine Degrees"&lt;/a&gt; Bergman, a liar and known nutcase. I've met Jerry Bergman; I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/that_bergman-myers_debate.php"&gt;debated Jerry Bergman&lt;/a&gt;; I've read &lt;i&gt;Slaughter of the Dissidents&lt;/i&gt;, which doesn't document anything other than the paranoia and lunacy of its author. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot take Bergman seriously. Bergman is the fellow who announced that there was a conspiracy among evolutionists to get the periodic table of the elements ripped down from classroom walls because it was a document that supported creationism; he claims to know a Christian chemistry teacher who was fired for daring to post Mendeleev's work. This is the Jerry Bergman who also claimed that carbon is irreducibly complex, thereby proving that Intelligent Design creationism was true. So Gaskell actually &lt;i&gt;recommends&lt;/i&gt; Bergman's work? I wouldn't hire him for that alone. That's a kind of fundamental incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Gaskell just digs his grave a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is a major problem in the life sciences. One recent major survey showed that 51% of scientists in the life sciences believe in some sort of "higher power" (which most of them identify as "God"). Half of all scientists also claim a religious affiliation. There is an enormous problem if one disqualifies one half of biologists because of religious
affiliation or beliefs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that makes no sense! If over half of all biologists are believers, doesn&amp;#39;t that fact right there say that biologists don&amp;#39;t get disqualified for their beliefs? I&amp;#39;ve been in this business for almost 30 years, and I&amp;#39;ve never once seen a committee meeting disrupted by bickering over differing religious beliefs — they are generally regarded as about as irrelevant on the job as what sports teams the faculty are rooting for. The only place where it could come up is if a faculty person started babbling irrational fairy stories that contradicted solid scientific thinking…and then they would be getting in trouble for bad science, not for what church they go to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's what made Gaskell a poor candidate for the position at UK: that he was publicly promoting &lt;i&gt;bad science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/gaskell_confirms_my_opinion_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/nFXTeX4NcHo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295709400891"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2011/01/lilac-coloured_concrete_hogbac.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc86265c591c4c0e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NOIBN"/><title type="html">Lilac-Coloured Concrete Hogbacks</title><published>2011-01-22T15:16:19Z</published><updated>2011-01-22T15:16:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/pk2t3_TIv5c/lilac-coloured_concrete_hogbac.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2011/01/lilac-coloured_concrete_hogbac.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2011/01/lilac-coloured_concrete_hogbac/2011-01-21%2008.45.38.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="2011-01-21 08.45.38.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t understand why &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; spends so much time attacking me and my new partner in crime, Eric MacDonald.  We’re hardly big-draw bloggers like P.Z. (though I bow before Eric’s superior knowledge of theology and philosophy), and our audience is largely the choir.  Or at least so I think.  But they continue, and Loren Wilkinson has now put up the second section of his critique, “&lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/one-world-science-and-christianity-in-respectful-dialogue-part-ii/"&gt;One world: science and Christianity in respectful dialogue. Part II: A response to Denis Alexander, Jerry Coyne, and Eric MacDonald.&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson’s point is strange: there are not &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; nonoverlapping magisteria, as Steve Gould and many accommodationists have maintained, but just a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; magisterium—one way of knowing—that encompasses both science and religion. I’ll call it Science, Truth, and Faith United (STFU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mark a sea change in accommodationism, in which their long-beloved NOMA philosophy—the idea that science and faith deal with completely different issues using different “tools”—is rejected in favor of a new philosophy of COMA (“Completely Overlapping Magisteria”)? So it seems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both science and theology are interpretations of texts, and neither can confidently be elevated as “eternal infallible truths.” The “texts” themselves have a more exalted status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one world in which we live: an elusive, tantalizing, terrifying and beautiful world of facts, always humanly, humbly grasped. I honor Denis Alexander’s “white paper” working at bringing some parts of that world together (though I disagree with his main conclusion), as I honor Jerry Coyne and Eric MacDonald in their criticism of it. But I beg them (and all of us) to move away from the language of scorn and derision and at least grant the possibility that the worlds of science and the worlds of religion are ultimately one world, not two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, but I don’t see a good reason to engage in “respectful dialogue” with Christianity, any more than I can engage in respectful dialogue with astrology or homeopathy.  After all, there is empirical evidence supporting the claims of science; there is none for the major claims of Christianity.  Why can’t &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; understand this difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to waste more time discussing Wilkinson’s screed.  The only good thing about it is that Templeton is wasting its dough paying someone to go after us.  But it is amusing to see how many fallacies you can spot in bits like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacDonald sums up the [anti-accomodationist] attitude by saying that when Alexander tries to speak of Biblical truths as though they were in some way parallel to scientific truths he is not really saying anything at all but “merely making marks on paper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such language reflects and reinforces the old “warfare” image of the relationship between Christianity and science. And perhaps that image would be appropriate if in fact science did deal only with the world of uninterpreted facts, and Christianity only with leaps of faith, dogmatic pronouncements, and endlessly flexible interpretations. Then the scientist and the Christian would live in separate worlds indeed, and there would be no possibility of “integration”. However, Coyne and MacDonald (along with Christians equally dismissive of science) have to deal with two awkward and intertwined facts (“a data set”). On the one hand, a very great many Christians (like Alexander himself) are good scientists. On the other hand, the statements of all scientists (including those, like Coyne, who make their public statements within the faith position of a-theism), stand, without acknowledging it, on a great mountain of belief, authority, and passion, the very things which they decry in religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In claiming that, in the end, science is just another form of religion, &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; is coming perilously close to the position of traditional creationists.  But Wilkinson and his sponsors should think carefully before adopting COMA as their official position, because I’m pretty sure that scientists—even Christian ones—aren’t going to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

They recently turned their attention to astrology — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/13/astrological-sign-of-the-times/"&gt;guess why&lt;/a&gt; — and did something truly cool: &lt;a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2011/horoscoped/"&gt;made a word cloud of the most commonly used terms in horoscopes&lt;/a&gt;. The sample was pretty big, comprising 22,000 horoscopes taken from &lt;a href="http://shine.yahoo.com/astrology/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; (which itself got them from astrology.com). Here’s what they found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh. Note that the common words appear over and over again in all the horoscopes despite the sign. &lt;em&gt;Feel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, and of course &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;… you see these in all the signs. Why, it’s almost as if the signs make no difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what I found more interesting is what you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; see: words with significantly different descriptive power. If different signs tend to describe different personalities, why don’t I see unique words like &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;extroverted&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;introverted&lt;/em&gt;, and so on? They scraped the most commonly used unique words for every sign, and they’re really not very predictive (scroll down to the Word Analysis 2 section on the Information Is Beautiful page to see).

&lt;p&gt;Dave Webster has figured out the trick to washing your kitteh without getting yourself shredded to hamburger and your bathroom inundated with water. It starts with getting the beast stoned. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/caturday-felid-bafftime-2/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/eFk0kAwLiEk/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to do this by putting on my bathing suit and getting into the tub with my cat. He could stand on my body while I was soaping him, reducing the cat’s helpless feeling (but giving me extensive lacerations on my thighs!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing about bathing a dirty cat, or taking it to the vet, is that it doesn’t ever realize that you’re trying to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; it. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to do this by putting on my bathing suit and getting into the tub with my cat. He could stand on my body while I was soaping him, reducing the cat’s helpless feeling (but giving me extensive lacerations on my thighs!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing about bathing a dirty cat, or taking it to the vet, is that it doesn’t ever realize that you’re trying to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; it. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>whyevolutionistrue</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Why Evolution Is True</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295696026562"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=32820">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82939d410402d7ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Secular Student Alliance"/><title type="html">Donations Against Damnations</title><published>2011-01-22T11:00:41Z</published><updated>2011-01-22T11:00:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/22/donations-against-damnations/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://studentactivities.tamu.edu/online/organization/OTU3Mjcw/profile"&gt;Agnostic and Atheist Student Group&lt;/a&gt; of Texas A&amp;amp;M heard that &lt;strong&gt;Brother Jed&lt;/strong&gt;, the notorious campus preacher, was visiting them next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of schools have found clever ways of opposing Jed’s crazy Christian claims.  We’ve seen &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/09/13/a-kiss-in-protest/"&gt;Kiss-ins&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/27/the-boot-protest/"&gt;Boot Protest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/05/30/jedfest/"&gt;fundraising drives&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kari Bean&lt;/strong&gt; and the members of AASG have decided to do some fundraising of their own.  Specifically, &lt;em&gt;they plan to raise money for the very groups Jed opposes&lt;/em&gt; — the ones that are friendly to gays, women, and atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called Donations Against Damnations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-20-at-9.49.38-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-20-at-9.49.38-PM.png" alt="" title="Damnation" width="435" height="567"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keri writes in an email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Right now we have over 10 different campus groups participating, ranging from the GLBT groups to some Christian groups… We have at least 2 ministers who are participating too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how you make the best of a sad situation.  While Jed is spouting hate, the atheists (with other groups) will be showing love and raising money for good causes.   &lt;/p&gt;

It's not a very good rebuttal, but I highly recommend his second paragraph in which he lists a good collection of links to several people who also ripped into his article. That part is excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then let's get into the part where he argues with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.Z. Myers is not, of course, the undisputed public ambassador of his discipline (although I've no doubt he sees himself as such), and by no means does the following apply to all biologists, or even all those who are critical of evolutionary psychology. But Myers' affect-laden views regarding evolutionary psychology do represent those of at least a significant and vocal minority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not an auspicious start to accuse me of regarding myself as "the undisputed public ambassador of" biology, which certainly isn't the case. This is a &lt;i&gt;blog&lt;/i&gt; written by a professor in a small town in rural Minnesota. I'm kind of aware of exactly what it is, and lack the airs Bering wants to assign to me. But then, this isn't surprising, since most of his following arguments rely on telling me what I intended, and he also gets that wrong. Except this little bit, where he does get the overall objections right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics are particularly irritated by the fact that evolutionary psychologists do not test for genetic inheritance of the very traits they argue are adaptive but instead rely on behavioral or self-report measures to evaluate their theories. They also believe that evolutionary psychologists take too many story-telling liberties in reconstructing the ancestral past, since we can never know for certain what life was like hundreds of thousands of years ago, when such traits would have, theoretically, been favored by natural selection. (This is a point also stressed by Rennie in his critique of my Slate essay.) According to Myers, the whole messy endeavor, therefore, "is a teetering pyramid of stacked 'couldas' and guesses that it woulda had an influence on evolution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually a reasonable summary of my general disagreements with evolutionary psychology. They are quite fond of inventing evolutionary stories about phenomena that don't even have an iota of evidence for being genetic, and can come up with truly awesome causal accounts for even the most trivial observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He picks out one of my objections to argue why the evolutionary psychology crowd can't do one of the experiments I didn't suggest doing, which is a little odd, but OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his post, Myers uses my discussion of the evolution of the human penis as a prime example of the sloppy work being done in the study of evolution and human behavior. He pillories psychologist Gordon Gallup's famous "dildo study," which suggests that the distinctive mushroom-capped shape of the penis might serve to scoop a competitor's semen out of the vagina. (I described this work at long, intimate length in two prior articles in Scientific American.) Myers calls this penis study "tripe" because Gallup and his colleagues failed to show how variations in penis shape within a population--and variations in how the penis is used for coital thrusting--directly affect fertilization rates. Instead, the researchers relied on dildos of different designs, surveys of college students' detailing their sexual behaviors, and a batch of artificial semen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, I can only assume that Myers has not had to face a university human-research ethics committee in the past several decades. If he had, he would realize that his suggested empirical approach would be unilaterally rejected by these conservative bureaucratic gatekeepers. Does Myers really believe that these seasoned investigators wouldn't rather have done the full experiment he describes--if only they lived in a less prudish and libellous university world? The fact of the matter is that research psychologists studying human sexuality are hamstrung by necessary ethical constraints when designing their studies. Perhaps Myers would be happy enough to allow investigators into his bedroom to examine the precise depth and vigor to which he plunges into his wife's vaginal canal after they've been separated for a week, but most couples would be a tad more reticent. Gallup's dildo study, and his related work on penis evolution, offered an ingenious--ingenious--way to get around some very real practical and ethical limitations. Is it perfect? No. Again, the perfect study, conceptually speaking, is often the least ethical one, at least as deemed by research ethics committees. But was it driven by clear, testable, evolutionary hypotheses? Yes. And it offered useful information that was otherwise unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telling me that they can't do an experiment that I didn't suggest doing doesn't really undermine anything I said. I'm perfectly aware of the ethical limitations of human research, which is one reason why I work on animal models. The problem is that what I actually offered as shortcomings of the work wasn't their failure to wire up my genitals, but this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't have any evidence that this behavior actually affects the fertilization rate of one partner's sperm over another, they don't have any indication of morphological differences in human populations that make some individuals better semen-scoopers, they don't have any evidence that this behavior has had a differential effect in human history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the criteria I would expect to see met in order to discuss this issue as an &lt;i&gt;evolutionary&lt;/i&gt; problem; what Bering's sources were studying were mechanical and physiological aspects of some plumbing (which can be interesting!), and then tacking on unwarranted conclusions about evolutionary history. In fact, I don't  see how Bering's strange and unexecutable experiment of logging the details of my personal sexual behavior would even touch my evolutionary objections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also skips over another relevant point I emphasized. &lt;i&gt;I read the research papers he cited&lt;/i&gt;. These were studies that had him "riveted, and convinced", but when I looked at, for instance, the study that found an increase in women's handgrip strength during ovulation, the paper itself mentioned that there were many other studies that showed &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; variation in strength over the menstrual cycle. Which is it? Do you just pick the result that favors your interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/the-women-of-slate-take-on-evolutionary-psychology/"&gt;Jerry Coyne has a summary of reactions&lt;/a&gt;, too, and mentions several instances where the papers aren't as clear in their support of the evo-psych hypotheses as is claimed. These are very noisy data that sometimes support and sometimes contradict their claims, and it seems that whatever result they pluck out of the mess, it's always in support of some purported evolutionarily significant effect on behavior or physiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in my previous article, I think the &lt;i&gt;general&lt;/i&gt; claim of evolutionary psychology, that our current behavior has been shaped by our biological history, is true. I think much of the research in the field is damaging to their thesis, though, not because it demonstrates the opposite, but because it flits over tiny details, like monthly variations in how a woman moves her hips or how she feels about men, and pretends that they're &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; examples of the power of natural selection in sculpting a genome that encodes every pelvic wobble and every nerve impulse.  It's become a kind of modern ornithomancy, where each dip and swirl and change in direction of a flight of birds is interpreted as directly connected to the fate of nations. I remain unconvinced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/i_have_annoyed_jesse_bering.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/9plQn0zs-Lc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295669358910"><id gr:original-id="http://theastronomist.fieldofscience.com/2011/01/universe-and-life-is-asymmetric.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa267d07f9ee8bcd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The Universe and Life is asymmetric: Chirality</title><published>2011-01-21T20:41:07Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T20:41:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/Or4Cfi6SDaw/universe-and-life-is-asymmetric.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://theastronomist.fieldofscience.com/2011/01/universe-and-life-is-asymmetric.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The shadow of symmetry haunts physics. Symmetry is invoked to understand nature concisely, but broken symmetry is invoked to understand nature completely. Physics is filled with examples of shattered symmetries: there is more matter than antimatter, neutrinos only come in the left handed spin flavor, and quantum processes break symmetries constantly, but nature also violates symmetry in chemistry and biology in a very clever manner. Chemistry and biology are subjects I do no normally touch upon, but I am intrigued by the curious circumstance of life on Earth: many molecules are not superimposable upon their mirror images, a property called chirality, and life on Earth has a preference for these chiral mirror configurations. Physics and life is inherently asymmetric.That something is not identical to its mirror image is a property known as chirality. Hands (etymologically the word chirality is derived from the Greek  word for hand), spiral galaxies, and the DNA helix are all examples of  chiral objects. In particle physics chirality is actually an abstract  notion defined by transformations of the particle with respect to their  right of left handed representation in the Poincaré group.  In chemistry chirality is well described by analogy to your hands wherein left and right hands cannot be superposed on each other even  though the fingers are the same and match up. This article is an exploration of chirality in biochemistry. I want to ask what makes life chiral, why is life chiral, and how did life become chiral. In order to supplement my limited knowledge of the subject I interviewed a world expert and author of over twenty papers on the subject, Robert Compton, who I must give a deep thanks to for being willing to answer my silly questions.It is important to accept that the concept of symmetry is tinted by the human notion of harmonious or aesthetically pleasing forms, but the strict mathematical interpretation of symmetry relies upon metrics of geometry. To this end many seemingly symmetric forms in the living natural world are actually examples of broken symmetries: spiral tree trunks, the human form, and sea shells (which generally only coil in one particular direction according to species). The remarkable thing is that this macro asymmetry can be traced back to a micro asymmetry in the chemistry of life. The arrangement of atoms in a molecule defines the function of that molecule, but even molecules with the same chemical configuration can behave differently as in the case of chiral molecules which are like mirror images of the same molecule that come in &amp;#39;left&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; handed forms. The great asymmetry of life is that all living organisms on Earth almost exclusively utilize the left handed (or levorotatory) configuration for amino acids and the right handed (or dextrorotatory) configuration for sugars belonging to DNA or RNA.Perhaps it is trivial or obvious that life is chiral when looking at the nautilus, but this obvious chirality is a macroscopic feature which belies the fine arrangement of atoms which defines the chirality of biomolecules.Different structural forms of compounds with the same molecular formula are known as isomers to chemists. A stereoisomer is an isomeric molecule which has the identical constitution and sequence of bonded atoms, but has a different three-dimensional geometry in space. An enantiomer is one specific steroisomer of the two possible mirror images that are non-superposable. The dominance of the left handed chiral enantiomer in biology is a massive blow to the idea that nature is perfectly symmetric and is an unsolved mystery as to why nature is this way.Many molecules are chiral, however because molecules are constantly vibrating the instantaneous structure of a molecule may lack the exact structure or symmetry seen in an ideal model.  Regardless, enantiomers have identical chemical properties except when they react with other molecules which are also enantiomeric in which case chiral forces yield a difference in behavior. Further, and perhaps more important for biology, particularly astrobiology, is that enantiomers have identical physical properties except with respect to the way they interact with plane-polarized or circularly polarized light or other chiral compounds. A pure enantiomer compound will rotate the plane of a monochromatic plane-polarized light by a certain angle in one direction, say clockwise, while the other enantiomer form of the compound will rotate the light by an equal amount in the opposite direction. Things that rotate light are said to be optically active.  Measurements with a polarimeter allow chemists to determine if a compound is chiral or not. Polarization of light by organic compounds was discovered in 1815 by the French physicist and chemist Jean-Baptiste Biot. He found that organically produced chemical solutions consistently rotated plane polarized light, but laboratory synthesized chemicals did not reproduce the rotation. Beyond conjectures he had no explanation for the phenomena.Years later Louis Pasteur preformed a similar experiment with tartaric acid produced from grapes and tartaric acid synthesized in the lab. Pasteur went further and somehow used tweezers and a microscope (I do not conceive to understand how) to separate the tartaric acid crystals which he produced in the laboratory into piles of left and right handed molecules. He found that polarized light was rotated by the left handed molecules that he had selected in the same way the polarized light was rotated by the organic tartaric acid. He concluded that chiral molecules are responsible for the rotation of polarized light.So chiral molecules rotate light, but actually so does an individual achiral molecule! In an ensemble of achiral molecules each individual molecule may rotate the plane of the polarization, but the net rotation averaged over the ensemble will result in zero rotation. A mixture of two enantiomers in a 1:1 ratio (which is what you get when you create chemicals in the lab) is optically inactive because the rotation results in a zero net polarization rotation. When a reagent or catalyst is optically active the chiral product will also be optically active, or in the presence of chiral forces such as circularly polarized light this may also induce optical activity via enantimoeric excess in the products as well. Generally you can get optically active compounds in two ways 1) The reagent in already optically active. 2) The reaction of achiral but optically inactive precursors in a chiral optically active environment occurs. It takes an optically active molecule or chiral force to produce a product that is optically active.Most chemical reactions are not enantiomerically selective so that the initial reason for a completely homochiral biology on Earth remains a mystery just as when Biot and Pasteur discovered chirality through optical activity. Of course chirality is simply geometric in nature and thus this geometric asymmetry is what makes life chiral. Any molecule that contains a tetrahedral carbon or other central atom bonded to four different atoms or constituents will exist in enantiomeric forms; given that all biological molecules are at least this complicated, then (almost?) all biological molecules exist in enantiomeric forms. It may be that the chirality of biomolcules is simply a consequence of the emergent complexity of basic physics. The conditions necessary for a solution initially containing near equal number of chiral forms to evolve towards pure chirality has been explored (see Frederick Frank 1953) and is plausible. A tiny initial imbalance has spiraled out of control and now each successive generation of biomolecules on Earth is produced by the previous generation of chiral reagents, thus this is the why life is chiral. None of this explains how life is chiral, but a common answer is that because life can be chiral it is chiral.From this persepctive this topic is not so interesting, honestly. I have come to the conclusion that chriality is as it must be given that each generation of life is spawned from the previous generation under conditions which do have enantiomeric selection forces present. The question is why was left handed chirality chosen for life on our Earth?Now actually, the chirality of biomolecules is not just...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Skept-artist: &lt;em&gt;Another time, in conversation, a woman said to her ‘I can’t stand Virgos’ to which my wife said ‘well I’m a Virgo’. The woman stammered for a moment and said ‘well you don’t seem like one’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I solved this problem years ago. When someone asks me what my sign is I say “greater than”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@IBY: &lt;em&gt;Huh, it seems like my sign didn’t change at all. I was Leo, and still Leo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Leos are known to be very resistant to change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the forced and coerced polygynous (no polyandry in FLDS), often underage marriages to a freely-entered polyamorous relationship is like comparing priest molestation to a consenting gay relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/student_group.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/student_group-thumb-500x443-60535.jpeg" width="500" height="443" alt="student_group.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you're more likely to find them doing this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/3-thumb-500x375-60537.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, perhaps surprisingly, about &lt;i&gt;seven times more likely&lt;/i&gt; to actually find them doing this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/3676692237_19c2828295.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/3676692237_19c2828295-thumb-500x375-60539.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="3676692237_19c2828295.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, that's according to &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2011-01-18-littlelearning18_ST_N.htm"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; by Richard Arum et al., &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Academically-Adrift-Limited-Learning-Campuses/dp/0226028550"&gt;Academically Adrift: Limited Learning on College Campuses&lt;/a&gt;.  Here, for example, is a breakdown of how college students, on average, spend their time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/studenttimeuse.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/studenttimeuse-thumb-500x866-60543.jpg" width="500" height="866" alt="studenttimeuse.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can hear the outraged parents now.  &lt;b&gt;What?!  Only 7% of their time -- that's 12 hours a week -- studying?!  How can you possibly learn everything you need to learn while only working 12 hours a week outside of class?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, there are the statistics:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; 45 percent of students "did not demonstrate any significant improvement in learning" during the first two years of college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36 percent of students "did not demonstrate any significant improvement in learning" over four years of college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And yet, they're still graduating with an average GPA of 3.2!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
(Story &lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/19/experts_note_limits_of_report_that_says_college_students_aren_t_learning"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While my own experiences are, in fact, pretty consistent with what this data shows, the actual, personal interaction with hundreds upon hundreds of students has taught me that there's a lot more to this story than "OMG, college kids aren't learning!"
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/index_02.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/index_02-thumb-500x302-60541.jpeg" width="500" height="302" alt="index_02.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, there is &lt;i&gt;tremendous&lt;/i&gt; pressure in this country on children, K-12, to &lt;i&gt;go to college and graduate&lt;/i&gt;.  That's the expectation of what you need to do to become a successful adult in this country, so we teach, pointing to statistics like &lt;a href="http://www.ehow.com/about_6128503_financial-college-grads-vs_-non_grads.html"&gt;college grads out-earn non-grads by $1.17 million over a lifetime&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/momoney.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/momoney-thumb-500x312-60545.jpeg" width="500" height="312" alt="momoney.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my experience, a quarter to a third of students in college &lt;i&gt;aren't &lt;b&gt;intrinsically&lt;/b&gt; motivated to be there&lt;/i&gt;.  The pre-med student who doesn't want to disappoint her dad?  The mechanical engineering major who'd rather be repairing automobiles?  The junior with an undecided major who really wants to direct a funeral home?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/figuring%20it%20out-0434_ea1aba1f-a321-49ac-ab06-8468f6662bad.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/is_college_a_waste/figuring%20it%20out-0434_ea1aba1f-a321-49ac-ab06-8468f6662bad-thumb-500x333-60547.jpeg" width="500" height="333" alt="figuring it out-0434_ea1aba1f-a321-49ac-ab06-8468f6662bad.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that, in my experience, pretty much every student -- like 98% of them -- is capable of working hard and doing well at whatever they apply themselves to, &lt;i&gt;but only if they care&lt;/i&gt;.  Otherwise, they're going to work exactly as hard as they need to in order to get by.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see students doing this in my classes sometimes, and I can't get too mad, because &lt;i&gt;I remember doing it, too&lt;/i&gt;, in the classes that I didn't care about.  You know what I'm talking about.  Students blowing off class, studying, reading, etc., and then cramming in all-nighters before the exams, and then never thinking about the course again once they've finished it.  You'll get by like that, sure, but you don't really learn.  On the other hand, when/if you want to put in the hard work, the opportunities for success and extraordinary learning are plentiful at every college I've ever been to.  But I don't believe the solution is to make the indifferent students work harder.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is to give them options that &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; want to choose.  Often, for many students, that means &lt;i&gt;delaying&lt;/i&gt; college, or &lt;i&gt;not going&lt;/i&gt; altogether!  But consider other options: the trades, manufacturing, maintenance, repair work, in fact &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; skilled &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker"&gt;blue-collar work&lt;/a&gt; is just as important -- if not moreso -- than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker"&gt;white-collar work&lt;/a&gt; is for our society, and is a &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; more fulfilling career choice for many.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's my experience, and my opinion based on it.  What do you think?  Do I have it all wrong?  Is this data really a sign of the apocalypse; a sign of our societal decline?  Or are we focusing on the wrong things, pigeon-holing our young adults into a career-path that may be all wrong for them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/is_college_a_waste.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295658074295"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LostInTranscription/~3/AG1ctGYfSTk/genomic-imprinting-iv-escalation.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22830976e41cca91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Genomic Imprinting IV: Escalation Between Loci</title><published>2011-01-21T18:37:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T18:37:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/0YnP7af46uM/genomic-imprinting-iv-escalation.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LostInTranscription/~3/AG1ctGYfSTk/genomic-imprinting-iv-escalation.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">So, in the previous installment, we introduced the &amp;quot;Loudest Voice Prevails&amp;quot; principle, which describes the evolutionarily stable pattern of gene expression at an imprinted locus where there is an intragenomic conflict over the total level of gene expression. Basically, the allele that favors lower expression becomes transcriptionally silenced. Expression from the other allele (the &amp;quot;louder&amp;quot; voice) evolves to the level that maximizes its inclusive fitness. In this sense, the active allele at an imprinted locus &amp;quot;wins.&amp;quot;

But what is going to happen if we have a pair of imprinted genes that exert opposite effects on the phenotype? If we have a paternally expressed growth enhancer, it will evolve to bring the growth phenotype up to the paternal optimum. If we have a maternally expressed growth suppressor, it will evolve to bring the growth phenotype down to the maternal optimum. But what if we have both?

Well, intuitively, if there is conflict between maternally and paternally derived genes over the optimal growth phenotype, then the phenotype can&amp;#39;t simultaneously satisfy the paternal and maternal optima. One or the other (or both) of these genes will always be under selection to increase its gene expression level (or, equivalently, the activity or longevity of the gene product, etc.). Thus, these two opposing genes will become involved in a kind of arms race.

In the simplest possible model that we can write down, this arms race goes on indefinitely, with natural selection driving each of the genes towards infinite expression. Clearly, in a real biological situation, this will not be the case, and something will step in to bring this escalation to a halt. The questions then become: What stops the escalation? And, what does the system look like at its new, escalated, evolutionarily stable state?

To think about this, let&amp;#39;s return to our analogy from last time, where Pat and Chris are sharing an office, but disagree about what temperature the office should be kept at. Recall that genes are totally passive aggressive, so Pat and Chris don&amp;#39;t compromise or communicate. They just use the tools at their disposal to move the office closer to their preferred temperature. Pat wants the office at 71 degrees. Chris wants it at 70.

We saw that if Pat and Chris both have space heaters, eventually Chris&amp;#39;s space heater is off, while Pat&amp;#39;s holds the temperature at 71. On the other hand, if they both have air conditioners, Pat will turn his/her A/C off, and Chris will get to have the room at 70.

If each of them has a space heater and an air conditioner, we have an arms race on our hands. Whenever the temperature is below 71, Pat will turn up the space heater. Whenever it is above 70, Chris will turn up the air conditioner. In passive-aggressive-allele fashion, this will go back and forth until the space heater and air conditioner are both blasting away. In the absence of any constraints or side effects, it will go on until both are blasting away infinitely.

There are several ways that the escalation could stop, however, each of which has a biological analog.

     (1) Mechanical limitation. There will be some limit beyond which gene expression / activity can not increase. Once one of the genes reaches its limit, the other will win. Like if Pat&amp;#39;s Tufnel-brand space heater goes to eleven, Pat wins. Of course, this will depend on the mechanisms through which the two genes exert their influence. For instance, if Chris&amp;#39;s air conditioner is actually a combination air conditioner / food processor / exfoliator, Chris might have to turn it way way up to get the air conditioning equivalent of a little bit of space heating. Similarly, a gene product might perform multiple tasks, and this pleiotropy could limit its competitive ability in the arms race.

     (2) Production costs. One difference between the single-locus solution and the two-locus solution is the level of energy consumption. If Chris&amp;#39;s space heater is off, Pat&amp;#39;s holds the temperature at 71. If Chris&amp;#39;s air conditioner is maxed out at ten, Pat&amp;#39;s space heater (which goes to eleven, remember) holds the temperature at 71. The difference is that the second solution comes with a huge-ass electricity bill. Can this sort of cost actually halt the escalation? Maybe. This requires either that there are diminishing returns to increased escalation, or that there are accelerating costs to production (like utility rates where your thousandth kilowatt-hour costs more than your first one).

     (3) Intervention. In a real office, we might expect that the manager would come in and yell at Pat and Chris, telling them to turn down their space heater and air conditioner. Maybe the manage would mandate an office temperature of 70.5 degrees. Does this ever happen with genes? Could a consortium of unimprinted genes step in and stop the escalation? There is no evidence to my knowledge of such things happening in the context of genomic imprinting, but this type of intervention is thought to be responsible for meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation, where the autosomes all gang up and put the sex chromosomes in a headlock in order to prevent meiotic drive.

     (4) Side effects. What if turning up Pat&amp;#39;s space heater also makes the music louder in the office? What if Chris&amp;#39;s air conditioner draws so much power that it causes occasional brown-outs? This is the other way in which the escalation between imprinted genes might be self limiting. If we consider a monolithic &amp;quot;growth phenotype&amp;quot; in isolation, then each allele has a simple, monolithic optimum. But genes are seldom like that. A paternally expressed allele may benefit from increased expression due to the effect of that increased expression on growth. But what if that increased expression has other consequences, as well? Maybe those other effects are detrimental to the allele&amp;#39;s inclusive fitness. If those deleterious side effects outweigh the growth-related benefits, then natural selection will not drive further escalation.

In future installments, we&amp;#39;ll look at some specific examples of escalating genes. But first, we&amp;#39;ll step back and look at some of the other features and consequences of imprinted genes.

The unsaturated fatty acids have not only been tied to lower heart disease risk in adults, but they have also been shown to boost fetal brain development, especially when consumed in the final few months of pregnancy. Given that I’m not much of a cold water fish fan—the thought of chewing a mouthful of sardines makes me want to gag—I’ve been looking into how else to get them, and what I’ve uncovered has surprised me.

I had always assumed that fish were the best way to go. Don’t get me wrong, they do contain a lot: cooked fresh salmon and canned sardines provide 1.7 and 1.8 grams of omega-3s per four ounce serving, respectively. But as it turns out, some seeds and nuts and their oils pack even more of an omega punch. One ounce of walnuts, for instance, contains 2.6 grams of omega 3s—ounce for ounce, six times more than fresh salmon—and an ounce of flaxseeds provides 1.8 grams. Their oils are fabulous too: a tablespoon of walnut oil contains 1.4 grams, and flaxseed oil has a whopping 6.9 grams (you’d have to eat nearly a whole pound of canned sardines to get that—eww!). Don’t be fooled thinking that olive oil is better, either. It contains just 0.1 grams per tablespoon.

Rather than taking on another broad hunt for the genes controlling the expression of alcoholism, noted addiction researcher Dr. Bankole Johnson and co-workers at the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia took a different tack. The researchers focused, instead, on investigating whether genetic variations among alcoholics might affect their responses to a specific anti-craving medication.

The result, according to Kenneth Warren, acting director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), is a study that represents “an important milestone in the search for personalized treatments for alcohol dependence.” 

For any addiction, once it has been active for a sustained period, the first-line treatment of the future is likely to be biological. New addiction treatments will come—and in many cases already do come—in the form of drugs to treat drug addiction. Every day, addicts are quitting drugs and alcohol by availing themselves of drug treatments that did not exist fifteen years ago. As more of the biological substrate is teased out, the search for effective approaches narrows along avenues that are more fruitful. This is the most promising, and, without doubt, the most controversial development in the history of addiction treatment. 

The researchers were interested in variations in the gene controlling the expression of a serotonin transporter protein. Dr. Johnson’s earlier work had centered on teasing out the influence the serotonin 5-HTT transporter exerts on the development of alcoholism. Previous research had focused attention on the so-called LL and TT variants of this transporter gene. After performing genetic analyses to determine which test subjects were carrying which versions of the gene in question, Dr. Johnson and his colleagues conducted a controlled trial of ondansetron on a randomized group of 283 alcoholics. 

The findings were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. 

Ondansetron is an anti-emetic medication that has shown promise in treating addictions, particularly alcoholism. Ondansetron (trade name Zofran), helps block the nausea of chemotherapy by altering serotonin activity in the GI tract. (Vomiting is a serotonin-mediated reflex.) The scientists found that “individuals with the LL geno-type who received ondansetron had a lower mean number of drinks per day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (11.27%) than those who received placebo.”  This put the ondansetron drinkers under five drinks a day. All of the placebo drinkers continued to exceed the five drinks per day mark.

But the strongest difference was found in the group of alcoholics who possessed both the LL and TT genetic variants. The LL/TT alcoholics taking ondansetron “had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-2.63) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99%) than all other geno-type and treatment groups combined.”  

The goal here is straightforward. In an email exchange, Dr. Johnson told me: “I agree that it would be great if we could use a pharmacogenetic approach to study other anti-craving drugs. The idea of providing the right drug to the right person is definitely important for optimizing therapeutic effects and minimizing side-effects.” (A video of Dr. Johnson discussing the research can be found HERE.)

It won’t be easy. Such genetic testing is still in its infancy, and complication abound. For example, in an earlier study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Johnson found that diagnosed patients who received ondansetron over an 11-week period increased their days of abstinence compared to alcoholics on placebo. However, in that study, “The researchers found no differences between ondansetron patients with late-onset alcoholism and those who received placebo.” This suggests that, along with genetic variations, ondansetron’s effectiveness with alcoholics may also depend on the type of alcoholism under consideration: early onset or late onset. 

We have a long way to go, but individualized pharmaceutical assistance in the early stages of addiction recovery remains the Holy Grail for many addiction researchers. And hopes are running high.

That’s just the way I roll.

Halitosis literally means “condition of the breath” and has many causes and just as many home remedies. Original therapies (and by original I mean 1550 BC) like heavily herb infused wines didn’t remove the bad breath but like mints and other modern treatments they just attempted to cover the bad smell with something more pleasant.

Halitosis isn&amp;#39;t limited to humans. Ever smelt a dogs mouth?

Halitosis can be divided into two distinct problems, transient halitosis (morning breath) and chronic halitosis. While the difference between these conditions is the time frame of affliction both have the same root cause. Sulphur.

A study by Suarez et al. looked at what caused the odour in people with morning breath and found that the unique smells produced by people were due to three sulphurous gases combining into a malodourous mixture. The gases, hydrogen sulphide (smell of rotting eggs), methanethiol (smell of rotting cabbage) and dimethylsulphide (which has a slight sweet smell), were present in varying quantities between participants giving them all bad morning breath.

The sulphurous gases are produced by bacterial build up in the mouth and in particular on the tongue. During the night your production of saliva drops significantly and with less saliva bacterial numbers increase dramatically. Saliva has a number of jobs in the mouth related to bacterial load but its three main roles are to acts as a tidal wave to wash bacteria out of the mouth, to inhibit bacterial growth using various chemical components and participate in the killing of bacteria by carrying parts of the immune system into the mouth. But less saliva equals more bacteria and consequently, bad breath.

Given this it wasn’t surprising that the treatments that Suarez et al. found good immediate treatments of halitosis (I say immediate because as saliva production increased the bad breath went away naturally) where mechanical scraping of the tongue. Specifically brushing of the teeth with toothpaste did nothing but brushing of the tongue with water was much more effective. Eating a dry bread roll was also very effective as it scraped across the tongue, removing bacteria.

The best treatment was a mouthwash of 5mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide – guess why. This treatment killed huge umbers of bacteria and immediately dropped the concentration of the sulphurous gases, which stayed low for hours afterwards.

While rare there are a few conditions that produce halitosis that has a non–oral origin but they are extraordinarily rare and halitosis is but one of a bevy of symptoms that the patient would possess.

Foetor hepaticus, or the ‘breath of the dead’, is seen in people with late stage liver failure. It is caused by the passage of thiols from the blood into the lung. These compounds are normally removed in the liver but as the liver shuts down thiols remain in the blood and can escape into the lungs. Apparently distinct from typical halitosis foetor hepaticus smells of sweet faeces.

Another condition, known as trimethylaminuria is also known as fish odour syndrome. People suffering from trimethylaminuria lack the metabolic enzyme Flavin containing monooxygenase 3 which breaks down trimethylamine to trimethylamine oxide. The result is that trimethylamine builds up in the blood and is removed in the urine, sweat and breath. Despite its name an odour of fish is rare and most sufferers just have an unusually strong and sometimes unpleasant odour.

So if you have halitosis, but don’t have late stage liver failure or metabolic disease, you can treat your bum breath with breakfast and mouthwash if you pedantic. So no excuse for blowing it in my face on the train from now on!

A recent NPR radio show covered the research of the biosemiotician Con Slobodchikoff of the Univeristy of Arizone on prairie dog calls. The piece is very public-orientated, but still might be worth listening to.

We’ve all (I hope) heard of the vervet monkeys, which have different alarm calls for different predators, such as for leopard (Panthera pardus), martial  . . . → Read More: Prairie Dog Communication...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Georgia, a homeless shelter ironically called House of Mercy &lt;a href="http://gayrights.change.org/petitions/view/demand_the_house_of_mercy_serve_gay_homeless_people"&gt;refuses&lt;/a&gt; to serve &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2011/01/18/georgia-homeless-gay-people/"&gt;gay people&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Elder Bobby Harris, who directs House of Mercy… says that his organization simply cannot tolerate homosexuality in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“That act is not tolerated here at all. Let me tell you one reason why: because of the bible, of course. And then we have little children,”&lt;/strong&gt; Harris says. He then added that if a gay person wants to change their sexual orientation and turn their life over to religion, he would consider serving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Harris told the local press that he would welcome “non-practicing gay people,” but even if the residents were to engage in sexual behavior on their own time off the premises, they would be rejected.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have little children?  So what?  Does he really believe that gay people will molest them or something?  *sigh*  No doubt.  Well, given his profession, he’s used to believing claims without any evidence…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the women kicked out of the shelter did an anonymous interview with a local news station. It’s heartbreaking.  And the pastor comes off as bigoted as you would imagine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one commenter at ThinkProgress writes, “WWJD: Who Would Jesus Deny?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think a petition would get this pastor to change his mind, but if you’d like to sign one asking the House of Mercy to change their discriminatory policies, &lt;a href="http://gayrights.change.org/petitions/view/demand_the_house_of_mercy_serve_gay_homeless_people"&gt;you can do so here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2011/01/plate-tectonics-by-squirrel-ice-age-continental-drift/"&gt;blogged about the forthcoming movie “Ice Age: Continental Drift.”&lt;/a&gt; I have not forgotten about my campaign to try to have some plate tectonics science added as a DVD extra or website feature. Below is a letter that I just sent to 20th Century Fox, Blue Sky Studios, and Ray Romano, the main voice actor for the movie. This letter could very well be ignored as the “ramblings of a crazy geologist,” but we’ll see if I receive any response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you because I am hoping you might help me find an appropriate contact for someone working on the movie “Ice Age: Continental Drift,” the forthcoming 4th installment in the “Ice Age” cartoon movie series. I am a big fan of the adorable “Ice Age” movies. The teaser for the 4th “Ice Age” movie (available on youtube &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-A77nHRQzY&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) made me laugh and smile, even if plate tectonics by squirrel is a completely ridiculous idea. Indeed, the ridiculousness of the concept is a large part of why I find the clip so delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do worry– a little– about young children believing in plate tectonics by sabre-toothed squirrel after watching this movie. I think most children are smart enough to figure out that plate tectonics doesn’t really happen by squirrel. However, I wonder if there’s any way to talk the people in charge of the latest “Ice Age” movie  into including an extra on the DVD or on their movie website that explains how plate tectonics really works. Even just a two or three minute clip– it could be a cartoon or an interview with a geologist– with a proper scientific explanation would be wonderful. I know that many children watch all of the extras on their favorite movies religiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since so many children will be watching the latest “Ice Age” movie, this could be a great way to educate a large number of children (and maybe even some adults) about how plate tectonics works. Note that I’m not advocating any changes to the movie script. The “Ice Age” movies are delightful because they are so silly. At the same time, I think a scientific extra about plate tectonics would be a great thing to include. This could be a win-win situation– 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios could do some educational outreach, and many children could learn a little science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is anyway you could help me express this idea to the people behind the “Ice Age: Continental Drift” movie, I would be most grateful. To give you a little background on myself, I am currently a 5th-year PhD student working on a Marine Geology &amp;amp; Geophysics degree in the joint program between MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In addition to my research pursuits in geology, I write a geology blog Georneys (http://georneys.blogspot.com/), and I write about geology, science, and skepticism for the Skepchick blog (http://skepchick.org/blog/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to discuss the science of plate tectonics, I would happy to volunteer my services as a science consultant. I would also be happy to put you in contact with an education professional who has experience teaching plate tectonics to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;
Evelyn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew we needed to end things. He was never there for me. I’d come home after a long day at work, wanting nothing more than a glass (well, a bottle really) of wine, a couch, and some of his sweet loving, and he’d give me nothing but grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He” was my cable TV provider. (I’ll let him remain anonymous, but let’s just say his initials are TWC and he’s sort of a big deal.) We were together for just over two years (at least in our last incarnation, but you know, there were several more years of “on and off” stuff before that). There were good times (many of them having to do with Bravo or Tina Fey), but there were bad times too. Oh, were there bad times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just can’t take this anymore,” I tipsily told a customer service representative one night. There I was, wanting nothing more than to erase my workday with some Viognier and &lt;em&gt;Top Chef&lt;/em&gt;, but it wasn’t working. The sound popped in and out of the recording, rendering it tragically unwatchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry to hear that m’am,” the representative replied in a sweet southern drawl, its mellifluous tones deepening the chasm of cliches between us. Me: angry, wine-soaked New Yorker; her: a sweet lady’s lady with a husband and kids and no fervent desire to watch &lt;em&gt;Top Chef&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;No Reservations&lt;/em&gt; RIGHT NOW GODDAMMIT. “Can you tell me what the display on your cable box says now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was always the same. They were always “sorry to hear that.” Sorry to hear that I didn’t have sound or picture or channels despite the ungodly sum I handed their evil employer each month. I could hear hours of training in their voices and their perfectly chosen words; a memo about better customer service, role playing exercises in as soulless conference room teaching a faceless army how to deal with enraged customers. This only infuriated me further. “Let’s try resetting your box… I don’t see anything on my end… I’ll have to send a repairman… the first available appointment I have is two weeks from tomorrow smack in the middle of the work day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final breaking point came not with Tom Colicchio or Tina Fey, but Jon Hamm. It was the &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt; season finale. I invited a dozen friends over to huddle around the glowing box, to eat, drink and rejoice in television, as man has done for ages. Someone made Chicken Kiev. Everyone brought wine. I turned on the television, eager to watch Don Draper screw up his pretty little life yet again. The picture sputtered to life and then continued to sputter, a sticky stream of pixels and disjointed audio. The crowd grasped. We took a deep breath, and switched from hi-def to the standard broadcast. Surely TWC could at least give us that. But it couldn’t…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We battled for about 90 minutes. With TWC’s cheap, unresponsive remote control in hand, I tried valiantly, clumsily to provide the finale we desperately wanted. It was out there in the ether, but we couldn’t bring it into my cozy living room. If we could watch it live instead of on DVR, if we could catch a later feed, surely it could work somehow… but it didn’t. I walked my guests to the door defeated. Then I picked up the phone, dialed the number I knew all too well, and ended things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I came home from work to find that my boyfriend had pulled the sickly cable box from the entertainment center and replaced it with an AppleTV. It had the feeling of a dead hamster being swapped out for a fresh one for an unsuspecting young child. But of course, I am an adult (sorta), and I knew this wasn’t the same hamster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sprang obediently to life, offering up a clean, crisp interface with happy chirps, like any Apple product. The boyfriend showed off the new baby joyfully, see it can play Netflix Instant or anything in your iTunes library, it’s so easy. I wanted to be happy. This was right. This was healthy. But, I couldn’t help but think of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I want to watch &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt; on the night it airs, not the next day? What about &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;? Or the CNN &lt;em&gt;Magic Wall&lt;/em&gt;? Memories of the good times flooded back to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boyfriend curtly reminded me that I’d rarely been able to make it to the end of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; without falling asleep, and that I’d wasting hours each week engaging in dysfunctional behavior with TWC, from phones calls and hold times to “technician appointments.” I couldn’t go back to that. We couldn’t go back to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They call the increasingly popular act of ditching your cable TV in favor of cheaper entertainment options, from Hulu to AppleTV to a good old antenna, “cutting the cord,” and it’s all too fitting a phrase. It implies we’re all just little babies tied not so much to an evil cable provider of a boyfriend but really an evil, omnipotent mother… a crack mother perhaps. “How do you manage?” friends and colleagues will ask when I tell them of my big cable break-up, as if there’s some sort of struggle to survive without the TV teat to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am surviving. Yes, there’s an occasional strange sense of disconnect, to, say, not being able to watch the election returns on that CNN &lt;em&gt;Magic Wall&lt;/em&gt; or have a sit down with Andy Cohen to review the latest &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/em&gt; train wreck. And there’s an odd new awareness of just what I’m viewing. Watching a TV show on the AppleTV, either buy buying it off iTunes or through Netflix Instant, feels like more of a deliberate act than scrolling through TWC’s offerings. That’s probably a good thing, and, as the (human, not cable provider) boyfriend is quick to remind me, it’s not like TWC ever really worked when I wanted him/it. True, but those times when it was good, those few, rare times, it was really good.&lt;/p&gt;

Arbogast&lt;/strong&gt; a letter explaining &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/uploads/news/Giles%20County%20Letter.pdf"&gt;why this was illegal&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Ten Commandments are in a frame along with the U.S. Constitution… The bottom of the posting says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exodus 20: 2-17&lt;br&gt;
The Holy Bible&lt;br&gt;
King James Version&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, you know, there’s all that Constitution and Establishment Clause stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Superintendent &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/uploads/news/Giles%20County%20Schools%20Response.pdf"&gt;responded with a short message&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that shocked me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As information, this part of the display will be removed and replaced with another historical document prior to us returning from our Christmas break.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow… that makes complete sense.  He did the right thing.  Good for the Superintendent!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad the school board thought otherwise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They voted 5-0 yesterday to &lt;a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/274441"&gt;reverse his decision&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
More than 200 county residents packed the school board meeting room and adjacent hallway Thursday afternoon, and &lt;strong&gt;a half-dozen parents and pastors told the board to honor God and continue to teach children that the United States is “one nation, under God” with the commandments&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have a moral obligation to what is right,” Elwood Lambert of Narrows said to the board. “Do not let our future children be deprived of this right — a God-given right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd clapped and cheered, and many answered “Amen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Gentry, chairman of the Giles County Board of Supervisors, said he and other local officials supported the community’s wishes “because it’s the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rev. Dan Kelly of New Valley Fellowship in Narrows told the board that his church would pay for the reframing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want a judge to tell you to take them down,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might come to that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it telling that the supporters of the Ten Commandments display are all Christians?  You shouldn’t have to be an atheist to see the problem with it.  It’s sad that all these kids’ education is controlled by a group of school board members who care more about promoting their faith than doing what’s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring on the lawsuit.  I’m sure the community members will be thrilled when the district loses money that should be spent on the students on a Ten Commandments display that has serves no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

What does this mean for an economist who happened to be born Albert Zyzmor instead of, say, Albert Aab? Two (real) economists addressed this question and found that, all else being equal, Dr. Aab would be more likely to gain tenure at a top university, become a fellow in the Econometric Society (hooray!), and even win the Nobel Prize.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/B1B7NMZ12o4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEPHEN J.

&lt;p&gt;Holy wow! Click to spacestationate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; cool. As the ISS races around the Earth at 8 km/sec (5 miles/sec), it sees up to 18 sunrises and sunsets each day, and the same number of moonrises and moonsets. Paolo had to snap quickly to get this sequence, which couldn’t have taken more than a minute to elapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s with the squished Moon? Here’s a closeup of the Moon in the three pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What causes this? It’s an atmospheric effect, due to the air surrounding the Earth acting like a lens, bending (or, if you want to impress your friends, &lt;em&gt;refracting&lt;/em&gt;) light. You’ve probably seen how a spoon looks bent when it sits in a glass of water, right? Same thing. Light passing from the vacuum of space through our air gets bent a bit. The amount of bending depends on how much air the light is going through; the thicker the air the more it’s bent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1957 Sputnik launching kick-started American progress in education and technology, but it also deepened an enmity between the world’s two super powers. Today’s Sputnik moment epidemic can serve to redouble our efforts in the teaching of math and science (though I’d hope not at the expense of history, literature, art, music, and the classics) and in the pursuit of new sources of energy. But let it not make China our 21st-century Russia. Let us not fall into the simple mindset that we’re playing a zero-sum game, where there is a clear winner and a clear loser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair enough. I support the sentiment fully. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, though, just as troubling as the Sputnik analogy is the Sputnik &lt;em&gt;dis-analogy&lt;/em&gt;. When it comes to investing in education and innovation, we aren’t responding to the current competitiveness challenge in anything like the way we responded in 1957. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we explained in &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;, following the Soviet launch of Sputnik this country poured a massive investment into scientific research, science education, space exploration, and much else. And that set the U.S. on course to dominate the world in science for the next half century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, by contrast, partisanship and ideology are preventing us from doing the same when it comes to clean energy innovation. We’re holding back our domestic clean energy industry because we can’t agree to put a price on carbon–and we’re doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; because we can’t even agree that global warming is our collective fault. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-m-gentile/will-the-united-states-co_b_810244.html"&gt;solar heads to China&lt;/a&gt;, and no wonder–that nation is now&lt;a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Global_warming/G-20%20Report.pdf"&gt; investing massively more than we do&lt;/a&gt; in renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the real question is this: Can partisanship and ideology become so powerful that they prevent the ability to respond to a Sputnik moment? Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that they can.&lt;/p&gt;

You may wonder why this story is not all over the mainstream media, as (if their claims turn out to be true) the world’s energy problems have just been solved, not to mention global warming. It might have something to do with the fact that cold fusion claims are nothing new, and every previous claim has fizzled under close examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is definitely a “boy who cried wolf” syndrome going on here. Of course, in the story the wolf did eventually come. It is unclear if cold fusion will ever be a reality (it looks highly implausible), but I always read over new claims to see if there is anything remotely interesting. So far, nothing has peaked up above the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem with cold fusion is that it is a field ripe for premature or false claims. Often claims are based upon excess energy being measured in some kind of setup. All of the energy inputs are measured and they are compared to all of the energy output, and if there is excess output that is often taken as evidence that cold fusion is going on and is producing the excess energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this kind of claim is very tricky. It means that all energy input and output has to be accurately measured. It also means that all sources of energy input have to be accounted for  – and if something is missed (like a chemical reaction) then that can produce the false impression of excess energy from fusion. In other words, it is easy for researchers to fool themselves with complex rigs or sloppy technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true of the preliminary results that we often hear about – small rigs with equally small amounts of energy – so that a little bit of unaccounted for energy can skew the results. However, these processes never scale up to industrial size, because at large scale the small errors either fade to insignificance (and the apparent energy production along with them) or the process simply does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, before cold fusion claims are taken seriously most researchers would like to see a few things. The first is a scale of production that is large enough that tiny errors in calibration or unknown energy sources could not be causing the apparent results. The second is to see the end-products of fusion. So if hydrogen fusion is claimed, it would be nice to measure the production of helium. It would also be nice to detect the radiation products of fusion, like high energy neutrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the current claims Rossi and Focardi are barely even claiming that their process uses cold fusion (or low energy nuclear reactions, and proponents like to call it, to get away from the stigma of “cold fusion”). They are using nickle and hydrogen fusion. They make no attempt to detect the fusion process or the end products of fusion. Their claims are based entirely on excess heat energy from their process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that with 400 watts input energy they can produce 12,400 watts of output heat. Their math seems pretty straight forward, but the real question is – are they accounting for all sources of energy? Are they missing some chemical reaction? They address this by measuring the weight of the container of hydrogen used, but that sounds like an insufficient control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also say that the process can run itself – that the power generated can serve as the input necessary to continue the reaction (which is reasonable if real nuclear fusion is happening), but that they prefer to run the process with external energy input. To me that is always a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They further claim that their process will be ready for industrial use in several months. They are building large power generators right now and will be ready to go soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their claims have many of the typical red flags for another premature cold fusion claim. They have not documented that cold fusion is actually happening, and they appear to be extrapolating from small-scale setups and are likely just making a mistake somewhere. Whatever the errors are, they will likely come to light when they try to scale up their process, or their process will simply not work in larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If history is any guide, Rossi and Focardi will not take such failure as evidence that their underlying methods or ideas are flawed. They will interpret it as a minor technical hurdle that they will soon overcome. Just you wait – they will have the problem licked before you know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that after a string of failures, and despite very unimpressive claims, that this time cold fusion is for real. I highly doubt it, and I am not holding my breath. We will likely never hear of this process again, and it will fade into the pages of the alternative cold fusion press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am usually most interested in is the precise mechanism of deception – how did the researchers screw up in order to convince themselves they finally achieved cold fusion? Failure can often be instructive – but only if you are willing to admit that failure has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.calendow.org/"&gt;California Endowment&lt;/a&gt; has a new enterprise, &lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/"&gt;Reporting on Health&lt;/a&gt;,  which includes journalism fellowships and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fellows is &lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/users/william-heisel-0"&gt;William Heisel&lt;/a&gt;; his blog is &lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/antidote"&gt;Antidote: New Ways to Investigate Untold Health Stories&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His advice for reporters, drawn from the lessons of  the Wakefield fraud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-1-media-should-help-undo-damage-vaccine-autism-hoax"&gt;Wakefield&amp;#39;s Wake, Part 1: Media should help undo damage from vaccine-autism hoax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a description of the sources Deer used for his BMJ pieces: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These documents and the rest used by Deer are great guideposts for health writers, bloggers and investigators hoping to fix what Wakefield and his colleagues have broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-2-passionate-parents-autistic-children-can-be-tricky-sources"&gt;Wakefield&amp;#39;s Wake Part 2: Passionate parents of autistic children can be tricky sources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This should serve as a lesson to health writers everywhere never to assume that the research subjects involved in a study actually saw the outcome of the study. Those subjects, should you be able to track them down, could provide the necessary evidence for verifying – or disproving – the study’s findings or probing flaws in the study’s design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefield%E2%80%99s-wake-part-3-trust-parents-autistic-kids-verify-stories-health-records"&gt;Wakefield’s Wake, Part 3: Trust parents of autistic kids, but verify stories with health records&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;note: this is sound advice for all unusual health claims, not just the &amp;quot;something caused autism&amp;quot; story.  Two things to keep in mind: &amp;quot;correlation does not equal causation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;anecdotes are not data, even in the plural&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As research has shown, self-reported health information is often flawed. Most parents — including McCarthy — aren’t trying to deceive anyone. When talking to a reporter, though, they may not be able to, on command, provide the clearest picture of the dates, symptoms, test results and other medical facts involving their child.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefields-wake-part-4-overcome-confidentiality-rules-used-hide-shaky-science"&gt;Wakefield&amp;#39;s Wake, Part 4: Overcome confidentiality rules used to hide shaky science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;....reporters need to push past glib suggestions that parents are wrong to be talking about these issues or that reporters are wrong for talking with the parents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the ways I have pushed past is by asking people if I can talk with their doctors directly and providing them with a release form to sign. I created a short form years ago based on a standard form that has been used by hospitals and physicians to allow patients to waive HIPAA protections. The terminology is important. You want to make it clear to patients and their parents that they are protected by HIPAA from having their private medical information disclosed and that by signing this form they are waiving those protections for the purposes of providing you information for a story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/wakefield%E2%80%99s-wake-part-5-treat-advocacy-groups-healthy-dose-skepticism"&gt;Wakefield’s Wake, Part 5: Treat advocacy groups with a healthy dose of skepticism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;So what’s a health writer who wants some good contextual quotes to do?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, stop dialing groups for a quote just because their name sounds on target. Placing “American” in front of something doesn’t make it a truly national or nationally representative group. Including “autism” in a name doesn’t mean that the group is involved in serious work to find cures and treatments for autism disorders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Second, treat these advocates the way you would any other source. I mentioned this before with parents, and it is worth repeating. Don’t let advocates make bold claims without proof. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Tabloidmed"&gt;Robert Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tabloid-Medicine-Internet-Medical-Science/dp/1607147270"&gt;Tabloid Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, posted a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaZlcpe3VDk"&gt;great video&lt;/a&gt; about what reporters should have said when interviewing Jenny McCarthy, who, as everyone knows, has her own advocacy organization: Generation Rescue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Third, find out who is paying the bills. If they are registered as a nonprofit, they have to file a Form 990 with the IRS, and you can ask them for a copy, ask the IRS for a copy or look it up on Guidestar. If they are not registered as a nonprofit, that’s odd and should make you ask even more questions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add: this advice holds true not just for autism, but any &amp;quot;miracle cure&amp;quot; for conditions that are defined qualitatively -- like learning disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...A witch hunt, of course, implies a band of crazed bigots and fear-mongers falsely accusing someone of a socially unacceptable act. Charges are trumped up. A trial is hastily put together. Witnesses lie. And the witch is burned at the stake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as metaphor, this doesn’t work in the Wakefield case or others like it. Government investigators and journalists like Deer didn’t try to pin some false crime on Wakefield. As Deer puts it:  “The regulator’s main focus was whether the research was ethical. Mine was whether it was true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take-away lessons for journalists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Question out-of-nowhere advances in science and medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow up by writing about who decided to fund, support and publish the discredited research.  Hold the decision-makers accountable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-7.26.16-PM.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-09-at-7.26.16-PM.png" alt="" title="GraduationCross" width="550" height="306"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don’t worry, though.  They’ll cover up the cross.  See? How could anyone be offended then?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, while I haven’t been able to verify this, one reader told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[The] pastor came on with a nice “Come to church and meet Jesus” video message just before the actual event.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s accurate, this is not simply a church offering a cheaper venue without trying to increase membership.  They want to use the service to preach their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, the school district finally &lt;a href="http://cherokeetribune.com/view/full_story/11080734/article-School-board--Graduations-to-stay-at-church"&gt;made a decision&lt;/a&gt; regarding what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Cherokee County school board is keeping graduation ceremonies for Cherokee County high school students at First Baptist Church of Woodstock even if it means a legal battle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board on Thursday night unanimously voted to continue holding its graduations at the county’s largest facility, leading to standing ovations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve people spoke in favor of using the church, the majority of which were students from county high schools. No one spoke against.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can have all the standing ovations they want. If Americans United decides to go ahead with the lawsuit, the school board stands to lose far more money than if they just paid for a secular venue.&lt;/p&gt;

Not much, it seems, according to the data in a new book titled &lt;i&gt;Academically Adrift&lt;/i&gt;. The book is reviewed in the latest issue if &lt;i&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/01/18/study_finds_large_numbers_of_college_students_don_t_learn_much"&gt;Academically Adrift&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The data aren't surprising. The authors of the book show that 36% of students failed to learn anything after four years of college. Of those who did learn something, the gains were very modest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why don't students learn?&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TTmzYxetJ2I/AAAAAAAAK8A/ej3J9x7r81o/s1600/quotation_marks_small.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:31px;height:25px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TTmzYxetJ2I/AAAAAAAAK8A/ej3J9x7r81o/s400/quotation_marks_small.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The main culprit for lack of academic progress of students, according to the authors, is a lack of rigor. They review data from student surveys to show, for example, that 32 percent of students each semester do not take any courses with more than 40 pages of reading assigned a week, and that half don't take a single course in which they must write more than 20 pages over the course of a semester. Further, the authors note that students spend, on average, only about 12-14 hours a week studying, and that much of this time is studying in groups.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Who's to blame for this sorry state of affairs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TTmzYxetJ2I/AAAAAAAAK8A/ej3J9x7r81o/s1600/quotation_marks_small.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0;width:31px;height:25px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/TTmzYxetJ2I/AAAAAAAAK8A/ej3J9x7r81o/s400/quotation_marks_small.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Debra Humphreys, vice president for communications and public affairs of AAC&amp;amp;U, said that she viewed the book as &amp;quot;devastating&amp;quot; in its critique of higher education. Faculty members and administrators (not to mention students and parents) should be alarmed by how little learning the authors found to be taking place, she said. Humphreys also said that the findings should give pause to those anxious to push students through and award more degrees -- without perhaps giving enough attention to what happens during a college education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In the race to completion, there is this assumption that a credit is a credit is a credit, and when you get to the magic number of credits, you will have learned what you need to learn," she said. What this book shows, Humphreys added, is that "you can accumulate an awful lot of credits and not learn anything."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;None of this is news my colleagues and me. Problem is, there's not much we can do about it. If we increase the rigor of our biochemistry courses and start demanding more of our students then the result won't be increased learning. It will simply mean that undergraduates will avoid biochemistry courses. In fact, that's already happening since the University of Toronto has developed dozens of new programs that will award degrees in the biological sciences without ever forcing students to take a rigorous course.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This brings up a question that I often ask my students. If university is supposed to be difficult (rigorous) then it's likely that some students won't be capable of completing a degree. In an ideal setting with expertly taught, challenging, programs, what percentage of the incoming class of students should expect to complete a degree? Clearly the answer can't be 100% because that bar is way too low. Should it be 50% as it was in many universities in the past? Lower?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The graduation rate at the University of Toronto has been pretty constant over the past decade at 73-75%. I assume that many of the students who drop out do so for reasons other than the rigor of university courses (e.g., personal problems, financial problems, transfers, changing goals etc.).  Let's assume that this accounts for 15% of the drop-outs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hat Tip: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2011/01/one_in_three_college_students.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2Funcertainprinciples+%28Uncertain+Principles%29&amp;amp;utm_content=Google+Reader"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Uncertain Principles&lt;/i&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-8214924745900362952?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295628404575"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2918">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7628d644326bf70d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Gov.

The occasion is New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's inaugural address earlier this month, in which the governor used the magic phrase twice (and talked about "underestimating" a third time without the &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt;). I give the requisite shout-out to Language Log, of course.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;There are opposing schools of thought for why “cannot be underestimated” almost always gets used in this topsy-turvy fashion. Mark Liberman, a linguist at the University of Pennsylvania who writes for the group blog Language Log (to which I also contribute), chalks up the problem to the inability of our “&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1292"&gt;poor monkey brains&lt;/a&gt;” to handle multiple negatives properly. Similar “overnegation” can be found in such phrases as “I miss not having you around” (meaning “I miss having you around”) and “I never fail to miss an opportunity” (meaning “I never miss an opportunity”).

In fact, for the days before and after Mars is opposite the sun, communication is risky because it is remotely possible that something could be misunderstood if the signal is messed up by passing near the sun.  So, from January 27th through February 11th there will be no talking to the Rovers on Mars (but some listening).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, Opportunity Rover has arrived at a rock that happens to be of interest.  The mass spec on Opportunity uses a radioactive source to elicit readings from rocks, but that source is rather old (half life of about a year, and it's been a few years...) so the mass spec has to stare at a rock for a week or so to make sense of it.  So, NASA will have Opportunity staring at this one rock for the entire time. Pity, because it might have been interesting to see if Opportunity could tell us what the other side of the sun looks like....&lt;/p&gt;

Perry Renshaw of the University of Utah School of Medicine believes from his analysis that the risk increases by nearly one third at an altitude of 2,000m (6,500ft above sea level). Renshaw analyzed data from CDC and found that altitude is an independent risk factor for suicide. He believes &amp;quot;...this association may have arisen from the effects of metabolic stress associated with mild hypoxia in people with mood disorders.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The western states in America have some of the highest elevations and also the highest suicide rates. In 2006, Idaho,Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and Oregon account for the 10 highest suicide rates. Utah was the 10th highest while Nevada had the highest suicide rate. Alaska was also in the top 10.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some specific suicide statistics for some the western states include the following states .Utah had the third highest average altitude at 1,940m (6,364ft above sea level) and had a rate of 14.1 suicides per 100,000 people in 2006. Colorado is the nations highest state at 2,2,00 m (7,217 ft above sea level) and had 15.8 suicides per 100,00 people. Nevada had the highest suicide rate of 19.6 per 100,00 people&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some other confounding factors in the analysis of suicide include gun ownership and population density. The west also has highest rate of gun ownership and a relatively lower population density. Suicide tends to be more prevalent in rural areas. These factors however aren&amp;#39;t sufficient to explain suicide at higher altitude according to Renshaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author postulates in his paper that mitochondria play an important role. Mood disorders have been associated with mitochondrial function for some time and individuals with mitochondrial disorders have an increased risk of depression. It may be that high altitudes provide a mild hypoxic challenge and people with mood disorders may have a problem adjusting to higher altitudes. On a biochemical level, studies of  low glucose media tend to cause down regulation of electron transport gene expression in lymphocytes in people with bipolar disorder while in normal individuals it caused upregulation. Changes seen following reduced glucose parallel those seen in hypoxia. Animals exposed to hypoxia have demonstrated rapid increases in brain mitochondria number and protein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Renshaw says, in the conclusion, that ecological studies tend to find a rather weak correlation since suicide is rather complex. Most people who commit suicide have psychiatric disorders so further research will be needed to clarify the effects of altitude on the course of mental illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_mid.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=The+American+journal+of+psychiatry&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F20843869&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Altitude%2C+gun+ownership%2C+rural+areas%2C+and+suicide.&amp;amp;rft.issn=0002-953X&amp;amp;rft.date=2011&amp;amp;rft.volume=168&amp;amp;rft.issue=1&amp;amp;rft.spage=49&amp;amp;rft.epage=54&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Kim+N&amp;amp;rft.au=Mickelson+JB&amp;amp;rft.au=Brenner+BE&amp;amp;rft.au=Haws+CA&amp;amp;rft.au=Yurgelun-Todd+DA&amp;amp;rft.au=Renshaw+PF&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CMedicine%2CPsychology%2CHealth"&gt;Kim N, Mickelson JB, Brenner BE, Haws CA, Yurgelun-Todd DA, &amp;amp; Renshaw PF (2011).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing A Good Mate Slows Fertility Decline&lt;/strong&gt;… in birds, that is. Studies show that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110118101515.htm"&gt;choosing the right mate slows the biological clock&lt;/a&gt; in some birds. We hope that’s true for humans, too. (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/"&gt;ScienceDaily&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Jerry’s post &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/experimental-acid-trip-ca-1956/"&gt;of 1950′s LSD experiments&lt;/a&gt;, here are a couple of NASA “experiments” involving weightless cats in the “vomit comet” – a plane flying in a parabola, so you get zero gravity (this was also the way they did the weightless scenes in the film Apollo 13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is from the 1960s, and I don’t bristle too much, though the cats are clearly distressed and I cannot see the point of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Sadly you can watch the video only on Youtube... &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9XtK6R1QAk"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second video, from the 1980s seems just plain dumb, and I hope the kitteh scratched them…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#333399"&gt;To analyze a sample Chinese population’s ability to understand and appreciate situational irony and compare its results with a sample U.S. population, surveys consisting of a series of 15 ironic and non-ironic cartoons were distributed electronically to 126 residents in the United States and 212 Chinese residents in mainland China. Respondents were asked to identify their initial reactions as well as rank their understanding and appreciation of each cartoon. Neither the concept of situational irony nor the research purposes of the survey was disclosed to the respondents, assuring that they would respond on the basis of independent judgment and knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Xiang Li's conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The Chinese sample tends to appreciate the humor within ironic and non-ironic cartoons significantly more than the U.S. sample. However, the Chinese respondents also tend to react more negatively (as measured by initial facial expressions) to ironic cartoons and react more positively to non-ironic cartoons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After all, the damn game has been in development since &lt;i&gt;1997&lt;/i&gt;. That shit has been in the studio since Bill Clinton was president. Since before I could drive. Since fucking &lt;i&gt;modems&lt;/i&gt;. It's been in development so long that it's not just the most &lt;i&gt;famous&lt;/i&gt; piece of vaporware out there; it's practically the &lt;i&gt;definitive&lt;/i&gt; piece of vaporware. When one thinks vaporware, one thinks Duke Forever. But there was a playable demo at PAX last year, and a demo is apparently going to see wide release later this year, and then the game is going to come out on May 3. It actually, really, seriously is going to come out. For reals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've been through this before, but never with this level of intensity. I mean, the game has never actually seen a real &lt;i&gt;release date&lt;/i&gt; before. This is as close as it's ever come to seeing the light of day. I will be skeptical until the game is installed on my hard drive and I am playing it, and even then I'll hold out the possibility that I'm either dreaming or hallucinating. That said, though, if this game really launches I might start believing in God. It'll be that life-altering. And as my friend Sean said, the only way the game is coming out is through divine intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, folks, is the second coming, coming to kick ass and chew bubblegum. And it's all out of gum.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-1932470189694151709?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295624142588"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/episode_clix_rational_discours.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6118079d5ffb2515</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Thread"/><title type="html">Episode CLIX: Rational discourse</title><published>2011-01-21T15:29:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T15:29:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/UwgXy40QGVM/episode_clix_rational_discours.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/episode_clix_rational_discours.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just know participants in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/episode_clviii_dont_blame_me.php"&gt;indeterminately long conversation&lt;/a&gt; would never stoop to the kind of conversation common among people like Rush Limbaugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rarely come across a source of interesting material as dense and extensive as &lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt;‘s World Question Center.  I’ve been diving into their 2011 question: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_index.html"&gt;WHAT SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT WOULD IMPROVE EVERYBODY’S COGNITIVE TOOLKIT?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”  Go take a look: One hundred sixty four intelligent people answering in quick essay format.  Excuse me while I get a paper towel; I’m drooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px" title="HurricaneKatrina" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/HurricaneKatrina.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150"&gt;I’m still going through them, but here’s a taste from &lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s&lt;/strong&gt; answer &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html#goldstein"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inference To The Best Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is that judgmental phrase, the best, sitting out in the open, shamelessly invoking standards. Not all explanations are created equal; some are objectively better than others… We decide among the remainder using such criteria as: which is the simpler, which does less violence to established beliefs, which is less ad hoc, which explains the most, which is the loveliest. There are times when these criteria clash with one another.&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
Many of our most rancorous scientific debates — say, over string theory or  foundations of quantum mechanics — have been over which competing criteria for judging explanations the best ought to prevail. So, too, have debates that many of us have been having over scientific versus religious explanations. These debates could be sharpened by bringing to bear on them the rationality-steeped notion of inference to the best explanation, its invocation of the sorts of standards that make some explanations objectively better than others, beginning with Peirce’s enjoiner that extraordinary hypotheses be ranked far away from the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s useful to recognize cases in which the same phrase — here, “best explanation” — is being used to mean different things at different times.  Offhand, I’d say that when I call something the better explanation, I’m referring to the explanation’s ability to empower me to make correct predictions in as many situations as possible.  If I’m wondering why water is falling from the sky, a story about petulant storm gods can be fun and poetic, but I’d consider one about low pressure systems better.  When our instruments detect low pressure systems, I have a pretty good rate of success predicting that my feet will soon be wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lot of confusion and apparent disagreement would be avoided if we would &lt;a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words"&gt;taboo the word&lt;/a&gt; ‘best’ in context and just say “You’re asserting that the storm gods explanation is more poetic and I’m asserting the low pressure systems explanation has more predictive power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you insist that this is a silly comparison, here’s a passage from &lt;strong&gt;Sean Carroll&lt;/strong&gt;‘s answer, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html#carroll"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pointless Universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view of the processes at the heart of the physical world has important consequences for how we come to terms with the social world. Human beings like to insist that there are reasons why things happen. The death of a child, the crash of an airplane, or a random shooting must be explained in terms of the workings of a hidden plan.  When Pat Robertson suggested that Hurricane Katrina was caused in part by God’s anger at America’s failing morals, he was attempting to provide an explanatory context for a seemingly inexplicable event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t seem so far-fetched now, does it?  I want to spout off that &lt;strong&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/strong&gt;‘s explanation was worse, but I need to be clear about what standard I’m using to judge.  Normative words like ‘best’ only make sense in context of the purpose – without defining what you’re trying to do with an explanation, it doesn’t make sense to use the word ‘best’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to fitting into Robertson’s model of preexisting beliefs, the best explanation was that God was angry.  But if we’re hoping to prevent such a tragedy from happening again, low pressure systems and poor preparation is objectively the best explanation.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, here is the update of the graph showing the annual mean anomalies from the IPCC AR4 models plotted against the surface temperature records from the HadCRUT3v, NCDC and GISTEMP products (it really doesn’t matter which). Everything has been baselined to 1980-1999 (as in the 2007 IPCC report) and the envelope in grey encloses 95% of the model runs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/model10.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The El Niño event that started off 2010 definitely gave last year a boost, despite the emerging La Niña towards the end of the year. An almost-record summer melt in the Arctic was also important (and probably key in explaining the difference between GISTEMP and the others). Checking up on our predictions from last year, we forecast that 2010 would be warmer than 2009 (because of the ENSO phase last January). Consistent with that, I predict that 2011 will not be quite as warm as 2010, but it will still rank easily amongst the top ten warmest years of the historical record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/?comments_popup=1810"&gt;comments on last year’s post&lt;/a&gt; (and responses) are worth reading before commenting on this post, and there are a number of points that shouldn’t need to be repeated again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Short term (15 years or less) trends in global temperature are not usefully predictable as a function of current forcings. This means you can’t  use such short periods to ‘prove’ that global warming has or hasn’t stopped, or that we are really cooling despite this being the warmest decade in centuries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The AR4 model simulations are an ‘ensemble of opportunity’ and vary substantially among themselves with the forcings imposed, the magnitude of the internal variability and of course, the sensitivity. Thus while they do span a large range of possible situations, the average of these simulations is not ‘truth’. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The model simulations use observed forcings up until 2000 (or 2003 in a couple of cases) and use a business-as-usual scenario subsequently (A1B). The models are not tuned to temperature trends pre-2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Differences between the temperature anomaly products is related to: different selections of input data, different methods for assessing urban heating effects, and (most important) different methodologies for estimating temperatures in data-poor regions like the Arctic. GISTEMP assumes that the Arctic is warming as fast as the stations around the Arctic, while HadCRUT and NCDC assume the Arctic is warming as fast as the global mean. The former assumption is more in line with the sea ice results and independent measures from buoys and the reanalysis products. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one upcoming development that is worth flagging. Long in development, the new Hadley Centre analysis of sea surface temperatures (HadISST3) will soon become available. This will contain additional newly-digitised data, better corrections for artifacts in the record (such as highlighted by &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/06/of-buckets-and-blogs/"&gt;Thompson et al. 2007&lt;/a&gt;), and corrections to more recent parts of the record because of better calibrations of some SST measuring devices. Once it is published, the historical HadCRUT global temperature anomalies will also be updated. GISTEMP uses HadISST for the pre-satellite era, and so long-term trends may be affected there too (though not the more recent changes shown above). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next figure is the comparison of the ocean heat content (OHC) changes in the models compared to the latest &lt;a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/"&gt;data from NODC&lt;/a&gt;. As before, I don’t have the post-2003 model output, but the comparison between the 3-monthly data (to the end of Sep) and annual data versus the model output is still useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To include the data from the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/05/ocean-heat-content-increases-update"&gt;Lyman et al (2010) paper&lt;/a&gt;, I am baselining all curves to the period 1975-1989, and using the 1993-2003 period to match the observational data sources a little more consistently. I have linearly extended the ensemble mean model values for the post 2003 period (using a regression from 1993-2002) to get a rough sense of where those runs might have gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/ohc10.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen the long term trends in the models match those in the data, but the short-term fluctuations are both noisy and imprecise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking now to the Arctic, here’s a 2010 update (courtesy of Marika Holland) showing the ongoing decrease in September sea ice extent compared to a selection of the AR4 models, again using the A1B scenario (following &lt;a href="http://www.cee.mtu.edu/~reh/papers/pubs/non_Honrath/stroeve07_2007GL029703.pdf"&gt;Stroeve et al, 2007&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/seaice10.jpg" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the match is not very good, and possibly getting worse, but unfortunately it appears that the models are not sensitive &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we update the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/hansens-1988-projections/"&gt;Hansen et al (1988)&lt;/a&gt; comparisons. As stated last year, the Scenario B in that paper is running a little high compared with the actual forcings growth (by about 10%) (and high compared to A1B), and the old GISS model had a climate sensitivity that was a little higher (4.2ºC for a doubling of CO2) than the best estimate (~3ºC). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/hansen10.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trends for the period 1984 to 2010 (the 1984 date chosen because that is when these projections started), scenario B has a trend of 0.27+/-0.05ºC/dec (95% uncertainties, no correction for auto-correlation). For the GISTEMP and HadCRUT3, the trends are 0.19+/-0.05 and 0.18+/-0.04ºC/dec (note that the &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A.lrg.gif"&gt;GISTEMP met-station index&lt;/a&gt; has 0.23+/-0.06ºC/dec and has 2010 as a clear record high). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, it seems that the Hansen et al ‘B’ projection is likely running a little warm compared to the real world. Repeating the calculation from last year, assuming (again, a little recklessly) that the 27 yr trend scales linearly with the sensitivity and the forcing, we could use this mismatch to estimate a sensitivity for the real world. That would give us 4.2/(0.27*0.9) * 0.19=~ 3.3 ºC. And again, it’s interesting to note that the best estimate sensitivity deduced from this projection, is very close to what we think in any case. For reference, the trends in the AR4 models for the same period have a range 0.21+/-0.16 ºC/dec (95%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to conclude, global warming continues. Did you really think it wouldn’t?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295622627060"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/mothering_a_bastion_of_quackery.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a8e68eb9b0dcc8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Mothering: A bastion of woo targeted at young mothers</title><published>2011-01-21T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/gWI_MsNObCY/mothering_a_bastion_of_quackery.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/mothering_a_bastion_of_quackery.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last three weeks, the &lt;cite&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;abbr title="British Medical Journal"&gt;BMJ&lt;/abbr&gt;) has been &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full"&gt;publishing a multipart expose&lt;/a&gt; by investigative journalist &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt; that enumerated in detail the specifics of how a British gastroenterologist turned hero of the anti-vaccine movement had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/piltdown_medicine_andrew_wakefields_scie.php"&gt;committed scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; by falsifying key aspects of case reports that he used as the basis of his now infamous 1998 &lt;cite&gt;Lancet&lt;/cite&gt; article suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and a syndrome consisting of regressive autism and enterocolitis. Indeed, Deer even went so far as to describe Wakefield's fraud as "&lt;a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2011/01/06/brian-deer-piltdown-medicine-the-missing-link-between-mmr-and-autism/"&gt;Piltdown medicine&lt;/a&gt;," comparing it explicitly to the infamous "Piltdown man" hoax, and in an &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt; the editors of the BMJ agreed. These revelations were not by any means new. Scientists had suspected that something wasn't quite right about Wakefield's work almost as soon as it had been published, and by 2004 Brian Deer had &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;uncovered clear evidence&lt;/a&gt; of major undisclosed conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part. Unfortunately, by that time the proverbial cat was out of the proverbial bag, and Wakefield's fraudulent research, aided and abetted by his flair for self-promotion in the media and some truly execrable, credulous, and sensationalistic coverage by the British press, had ignited a major scare over the MMR vaccine. MMR uptake rates plummeted below levels necessary for herd immunity, and measles came roaring back with a vengeance in the U.K. By the time the British General Medical Council finally ruled about a year ago that Wakefield had committed research fraud and violated research ethics in the work reported in his 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; article and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8695267.stm"&gt;recommended that he be "struck off"&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., have his license to practice medicine in the U.K. revoked) and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/05/andrew_wakefield_struck_off.php"&gt;finally was struck off&lt;/a&gt;, the damage had been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As important as Wakefield is to the genesis of the modern anti-vaccine movement, however, there is another force that acts far more "where the rubber hits the road," so to speak. This force comes in the form of publications and online discussion forums that cater to new mothers, offering all manner of advice and support. Some of these are very good, but all too many of them are hotbeds of anti-vaccine pseudoscience, confidently proclaimed by "elder statesman" members of these forums and included in articles published in glossy, attractive magazines. As a rather ironic coincidence, just as news of Andrew Wakefield's latest humiliation was finding its way out into multiple news outlets over the last couple of weeks, the first issue of 2011 of just such a glossy publication had hit the shelves a couple of weeks before. I'm referring to &lt;a href="http://mothering.com/"&gt;Mothering&lt;/a&gt;, whose tagline is "Inspiring Natural Families Since 1976." In reality, it should read: "Inspiring quackery and anti-vaccine views since 1976." Of course, in the world of "alt-med," the two often go hand-in-hand. In any case, one of my readers sent me a link to the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Mothering&lt;/em&gt;. As I've pointed out before, &lt;em&gt;Mothering&lt;/em&gt; is, particularly with respect to vaccines but not limited to vaccines. Taking into account its large and vigorous online forums, &lt;em&gt;Mothering&lt;/em&gt; is major force for the promotion of anti-vaccine views and quackery among new mothers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/mothering_a_bastion_of_quackery.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/mothering_a_bastion_of_quackery.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/gWI_MsNObCY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295622199440"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=15151">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eebf2357ded78a19</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conservatives and Science"/><category term="Global Warming"/><title type="html">Where’s George Will When You Need Him?</title><published>2011-01-21T15:02:52Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T15:02:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DiscoverIntersection/~3/q9EcKVo-jF8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/01/21/wheres-george-will-when-you-need-him/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021302514.html"&gt;awful George Will column&lt;/a&gt; from 2009 claiming that ” according to the U.N. World Meteorological Organization, there has been no recorded global warming for more than a decade, or one-third of the span since the global cooling scare”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I rebutted it &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/03/20/ST2009032003115.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is one of many respected scientific institutions that support the consensus that humans are driving global warming. Will probably meant that since 1998 was the warmest year on record according to the WMO — NASA, in contrast, believes that that honor goes to 2005 — we haven’t had any global warming since. Yet such sleight of hand would lead to the conclusion that “global cooling” sets in immediately after every new record temperature year, no matter how frequently those hot years arrive or the hotness of the years surrounding them. Climate scientists, knowing that any single year may trend warmer or cooler for a variety of reasons — 1998, for instance, featured an extremely strong El Niño — study globally averaged temperatures over time. To them, it’s far more relevant that out of the 10 warmest years on record, at least seven have occurred in the 2000s — again, according to the WMO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as if that isn’t a strong enough critique, &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2011/01/20/world-meteorological-organization-wmo-2010-record-hottest-year-long-term-warming-trend-extreme-weather-events/"&gt;now comes the WMO&lt;/a&gt; with the message that 2010 is tied for with 1998 and 2005 for the world’s hottest year on record:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The 2010 data confirm the Earth’s significant long-term warming trend,” said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. “The ten warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ten years from 2001 to 2010, global temperatures have averaged 0.46°C (0.83°F) above the 1961-1990 average, and are the highest ever recorded for a 10-year period since the beginning of instrumental climate records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what Will will have to say about this? I’d say he owes the WMO an apology.&lt;/p&gt;

As soon as I saw the article on the news.com.au site &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/sci-tech/tatooines-twin-suns-coming-to-a-planet-near-you-just-as-soon-as-betelgeuse-explodes/story-fn5fsgyc-1225991009247" rel="nofollow"&gt;desperately trying to link Betelgeuse going supernova with the nonsense about the Mayans and 2012&lt;/a&gt;, my gut reaction was to write about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, I figured a minute later, this story would blow over. So to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should’ve known: instead of going away, it gets picked up by that bastion of antiscience, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/20/two-suns-twin-stars_n_811864.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grrrr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; in the original article is pretty good; they talked with scientist Brad Carter who discusses the scenario of Betelgeuse going supernova. The whole story is pretty interesting — I wrote about it in detail &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/01/is-betelgeuse-about-to-blow/"&gt;the last time there was nonsense about Betelgeuse blowing up&lt;/a&gt; —  but in a nutshell Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star in Orion with about 20 times the mass of the Sun, and it’s very near the end of its life. When stars this massive die, they explode as supernovae. The distance to Betelgeuse is unclear (it has a very puffy outer atmosphere which makes distance determination somewhat dicey) but ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/3i00hd7iomquf4dkhramao81dk/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fbadastronomy%2F2011%2F01%2F21%2Fbetelgeuse-and-2012%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~4/fMqAUppWwy0" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295618336155"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/congratulations_to_jesus_mo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d89e53e27a155234</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weblogs"/><title type="html">Congratulations to Jesus &amp;amp; Mo</title><published>2011-01-21T13:48:47Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T13:48:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/gtABNt7z_X4/congratulations_to_jesus_mo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/congratulations_to_jesus_mo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The webcomic &lt;a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/"&gt;Jesus and Mo&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2011/01/best_comics_contest_and_the_wi.html"&gt;Riffy Award&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;And so we have the first of what will be another interminably tedious &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; production, “&lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/one-world-science-and-christianity-in-respectful-dialogue-part-i/"&gt;One World: Science and Christianity in Respectful Dialogue, Part I: A Response to Alexander, Coyne, and MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;.”   The piece was written by one Loren Wilkinson, a professor at Regent College who is funded by the Templeton Foundation to help “Christian ministers involve science and scientists more thoroughly in their preaching, teaching, and worship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denis Alexander, as you may recall, is the dude who wrote that &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/uploads/projects/alexander_white_paper.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; white paper&lt;/a&gt; on how to reconcile science with Adam and Eve.  He takes a few knocks from Wilkinson for proposing weird solutions, but the bulk of Wilkinson’s criticisms are directed at MacDonald, me, and anti-accommodationism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you have an industrial-sized roll of Tums at hand, don’t bother with more than a few paragraphs of the &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; piece.  You get the tenor right at the beginning, where Wilkinson says the “warfare” model is wrong because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .it obscures the recognition that science at its core, is a &lt;em&gt;religious&lt;/em&gt; activity, in the deepest and most literal sense of “re-ligious”—that which links. Religion and science both come from the uniquely human passion to see the diverse pieces of our experience as one supple and coherent body of knowledge: thus its connection with a word like “ligament”, the tissue which holds the skeleton together. There is no science without scientists, and scientists are always and only humans, probing and coming to know an inexhaustibly mysterious cosmos by means of their own passions, beliefs, hunches and theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oy gewalt!  I almost stopped reading right there, but steeled myself and read to the end, for the same reason that people crane their necks at a car wreck.  You’ll be amused at the other two reasons why Wilkinson considers the “warfare model” wrong.  They involve science having deep Judeo-Christian roots and his claim that there is only one kind of knowledge in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; tired of refuting BioLogo’s lame arguments for a the existence of only a single “magisterium” that combines science and faith. But Eric MacDonald, with his lovely new website &lt;a href="http://choiceindying.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choice in Dyin&lt;/em&gt;g&lt;/a&gt;, saved me a ton of work by demolishing Wilkinson in a piece called “&lt;a href="http://choiceindying.com/2011/01/20/pouring-oil-on-troubled-waters/"&gt;Pouring oil on troubled waters.&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are simply not two kinds of knowledge, only one. There is, so far as we can know with assurance, no religious knowledge, and emotion and authority, while they may effectively control what people will think and feel, cannot provide knowledge. Science, however, and forms of critical thought which are related to science, do provide knowledge, always partial, provisional, and revisable, which nevertheless comprise conclusions that we can hold with some assurance, even though they might eventually be taken up into larger and more inclusive theories. Science, of course, is not without emotion. It does not happen unless people are devoted to finding out the truth about our experience of the world, and so it involves personal commitment, and all the emotional entanglements that that entails. Wilkinson’s idea that science without religion would be lifeless, emotionless, devoid of commitment, hope or expectation, is simply falsified by the work that scientists do. And there is no reason to envision science in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How lovely to have Eric an an ally!  He can pwn the faithful as only an ex-priest can, and his muscular prose blows away the tiresome and evasive apologetics of the &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; crowd.  Really, I don’t know how they can publish that stuff with a straight face.&lt;/p&gt;

They're rather vague about what they're praying for, which I guess is tactically useful, since if I stay healthy or drop dead they can then claim success either way. I'm also going to confound their experiment since I'm going to tell everyone to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; Pray4PZ, and since their site traffic is so minuscule, I'm going to overwhelm their results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a post titled &lt;a href="http://www.efficacyofprayer.com/forum/topic/can-pz-myers-be-reasoned-with"&gt;"Can PZ Myers be reasoned with?"&lt;/a&gt;, which is amusing — I guess the prayer effort wasn&amp;#39;t doing much, so they had to resort to reason, and they even do that ineffectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've also got an online poll, and I'm embarrassed to point it out. The subject is me again, it was set up 11 months ago, and it has received ONE vote so far. That's just sad.&lt;/p&gt;

Fascinatingly, the Denisovans seem to have made about a 5% contribution to the genome of living Melanesians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned that this new discovery did not seem compatible with a young-earth creationist framework, and awaited with interest a creationist explanation of the findings. Answers In Genesis (AIG) has now &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2011/01/08/news-to-note-01082011#three" rel="external "&gt;commented on the Denisovans&lt;/a&gt;. No explanation, merely a one-sentence handwaving solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Answers in Genesis Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But the most interesting twist (from the evolutionary perspective) is that modern humans from New Guinea have Denisovan DNA. While an evolutionary perspective interprets this as meaning that Guineans’ ancestors “interbred” with Denisovans, a biblical perspective interprets this as simply meaning that the descendants of one of the people groups leaving Babel eventually settled in what is now New Guinea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what this even means. After all, their ‘biblical perspective’ had exactly the same interpretation (that the descendants of a group leaving Babel settled in New Guinea) even before we knew about the Denisovan genetic contribution. This ‘explanation’ fails to address a key point: how did the Denisovan genes get into Melanesians, if not by interbreeding with Denisovans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the above scenario doesn’t resolve any of the other problems with a young-earth framework.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is the Denisovan genome so different from all modern humans, if they were descended from the same eight people on the Ark? (The Denisovans would, presumably, have to be another group of people who left Babel, since Babel happens after the global flood in the Bible.) Why does Africa have the greatest genetic diversity in modern humans but no Neanderthal or Denisovan genes? Why are Neanderthal genes found in all non-Africans, but not in Africans? The genetic diversity of modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans is much greater than that of modern humans alone. How could there be so much genetic diversity so soon after disembArking from the Ark? How did all that extra genetic diversity disappear? Genes can disappear quickly in population bottlenecks, or slowly through random processes like genetic drift in stable populations, but it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unlikely for genes, let alone large numbers of genes, to disappear in a rapidly expanding population (and going from 8 to 7 billion in under 10000 years is definitely rapid expansion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the question of what species the Denisovans should be assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cautiously, and commendably IMO, the scientists declined to classify the Denisovans taxonomically, given that we know almost nothing about their anatomy. Answers in Genesis, of course, considers them all humans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Answers in Genesis Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Writing for BBC News, Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, emphasizes that both Denisovans and Neanderthals belonged to our species, &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. (Indeed, given the original definition of species as referring to organisms that could interbreed successfully, treating them as separate species doesn’t make sense. However, that definition is no longer observed.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason why scientists have struggled since before Darwin to define what a species is. It’s called the ‘&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem" rel="external "&gt;species problem&lt;/a&gt;’, and it’s why so many species definitions and concepts have been proposed. Basically, the world is a complex, messy place. Scientists would love it if they could use AIG’s definition. They can’t and don’t, because it doesn’t work in the real world. It may be simple, but it’s also simple-minded. Do we really want to put lions and tigers in the same species? Dogs and wolves? The fact that lions and tigers can interbreed is less important to biologists than the fact they they differ in many other important ways. There are other problems. For example, AIG’s definition doesn’t handle cases where species A can interbreed with B, and B with C, but A can’t interbreed with C. It’s an inherently difficult problem that will probably never be fully solved because the complexity of life defies easy categorization.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26969" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/more-overcharges/bill/"&gt;&lt;img title="Bill" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bill.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=88" alt="" width="500" height="88"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I pay only about 5% of this, but, I swear, when this is all over  the total bill for my sinus surgery will be in the vicinity of fifty thousand dollars.  And  that’s what an uninsured American would have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a lighter note, we once discussed &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/12/22/tonsorial-discrimination/"&gt;the disparity of pricing between men’s and women’s haircuts&lt;/a&gt;. I believe someone maintained that in a real barber shop (and not a salon or “unisex parlor”) there is no differential.  Sadly, at least in Hyde Park, there is.  Here’s a sign in the window of the local barbershop—a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; barbershop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26970" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/more-overcharges/barbers/"&gt;&lt;img title="Barbers" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/barbers.jpg?w=425&amp;amp;h=503" alt="" width="425" height="503"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, in this shop women’s haircuts include a shampoo and men’s do not.  But if a man had both a crop and a shampoo, it would cost him $20.  The same for a woman would be $4 more.  If I were a woman, particularly one with short hair or a simple hairstyle, I’d be peeved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to my devotion as a natural product pharmacologist, I’m proud to say that new life would not have come to nitroxoline had not a fungal natural product called fumagillin been studied as an antiangiogenic anticancer drug – one that inhibits the formation of new blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Let’s step back for a moment. Fumagillin, was first isolated as an antibiotic in 1949 from a culture of &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus.&lt;/em&gt; Most recently, fumagillin has been used in honey bee hives as an antiparasitic drug to control the microsporidium parasite, &lt;em&gt;Nosema cerenae. &lt;/em&gt;You might recognize the name of this parasite from the controversial &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013181"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; last year by Jerry Bromenshenk’s group at Montana who hypothesized that the parasite synergizes with the iridovirus IIV to cause colony collapse disorder. (Disclosure: I write &lt;a href="http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected"&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt; at PLoS Blogs network, operated by the publisher of &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bee that as it may (pun intended), fumagillin was serendiptously identified again in 1990 by a group led by the late antiangiogenesis pioneer, Dr. Judah Folkman. (Note to the reader: I’m treading here on the expert ground of SBM editor Dr. David Gorski, so I’m sure he’ll weigh in to correct me somewhere herein).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v348/n6301/abs/348555a0.html"&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt;, Folkman’s group found &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt; as a contaminant of a culture of capillary endothelial cells and noted that it caused cell rounding similar to other angiogenesis inhibitors. Indeed, the fungus was secreting fumagillin. However, fumagillin itself had too much systemic toxicity when used in mouse models of human cancer. So, with colleagues from the Japanese drug company Takeda, the group synthesized analogs of fumagillin, the most active of which was a compound called AGM-1470 or, later, TNP-470. However, the drug suffered from a poor bioavailability when taken orally and a short half-life in clinical trials. Folkman’s group continued to work on &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587385"&gt;a new formulation&lt;/a&gt; of TNP-470 described in a 2008 &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt; paper that appeared after he passed away at age 74.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most noteworthy about fumagillin and its analogs was that they revealed an entirely new way of halting the growth of endothelial cells in tumors. In 1997, the laboratory of Craig Crews at Yale University took advantage of a chemically reactive group on the fumagillin molecule – an epoxide – to purify from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) a protein that was bound by the drug. As detailed in &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/94/12/6099.long"&gt;this PNAS paper&lt;/a&gt;, the drug’s target turned out to be a metalloproteinase called methionine aminopeptidase-2, or MetAP2. A group led by Jun Liu, then at MIT, demonstrated that TNP-470 also targeted this enzyme which acts by cleaving the initial methonine residue from a subset of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Liu’s group, now at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, screened a library of 175,000 compounds for agents capable of inhibiting MetAP-2 in parallel with another group of approved drugs from all therapeutic classes. Emerging from both of these screens was nitroxoline, a drug used to treat urinary tract infections &lt;a href="http://archive.samj.org.za/1978%20VOL%20LIV%20Jul-Dec/Articles/12%20December/1.4%20ANTIBACTERIAL%20ACTIVITY%20OF%20NITROXOLINE%20AND%20SULPHAMETHIZOLE%20ALONE%20IN%20COMBINATION%20IN%20URINARY%20TRA.pdf"&gt;in South Africa (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; as early as 1978, sold under the trade name, Nicene-N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Liu group’s &lt;a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/102/24/1855.full"&gt;most recent paper&lt;/a&gt; appearing in November 2010 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/em&gt;, nitroxoline was investigated for its antiangiogenic activity against human xenografts of breast and bladder cancer in mice. At doses similar to those given to humans, nitroxoline had good efficacy – but not hugely impressive – in slowing tumor growth and inhibiting microvessel formation both models. The activity against the bladder cancer was interesting since the tumor cells were implanted orthotopically (in the bladder) rather than in the subcutaneous tissue of the animal. Why bladder cancer? Because over 70% of the administered dose of nitroxoline in humans accumulates in the bladder. These findings are, of course, preliminary – the investigators only used one dose of the drug in this work and did not try to combine it with any other commonly used chemotherapeutic drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I don’t get too excited about a drug with activity against human tumor xenografts until it shows good pharmacokinetic properties in people. However, nitroxoline has been used clinically and already has a history of safe human use. Repurposing old drugs with activity against novel targets presents a lower barrier of risk for pharmaceutical development when compared with an exciting novel compound of unknown human safety and bioavailability. Such compounds are more likely to proceed to clinical trials – although nitroxoline is not currently approved in the US, its approval elsewhere is likely to speed human studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, nitroxoline will not be a cure for cancer. But it does provide a lesson of the value of natural products in the identification of new cellular targets. Nitroxoline’s antiangiogenic activity would not have been discovered had fumagillin not been identified as a MetAP2 inhibitor. And further study of nitroxoline has revealed that it has an additional activity not shared by TNP-470: it also inhibits the SIRT1 class of histone deacetylases. This finding opens another avenue for the study of SIRT1 inhibitors with agents that target MetAP2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, atheism came up in conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gervais says that religious people shouldn’t be offended at his recent &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/12/19/ricky-gervais-atheistic-holiday-message/"&gt;pro-atheism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2011/01/16/ricky-gervais-thanks-god-for-making-him-an-atheist-at-the-golden-globes/"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;.  After all, he doesn’t get offended when they thank a god in their acceptance speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gervais added that religious people “haven’t got the monopoly on good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why it’s a boon to have strong spokespeople for our outlook.  Gervais just appears calm, sincere, and certainly not anti-religious.  He’s just stating the facts as he sees them and he sounds like he genuinely can’t understand what all the uproar is about.  Though, smart as he is, he has to have an idea…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, he can crack all the religion jokes he wants. The media can’t stop talking about them, and each one just gets more attention than the last. &lt;/p&gt;

By some cosmic coincidence, the first station I tuned to happened to feature a discussion of language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;[ The astute reader will note a certain vagueness in my recollection of various details below. This is because I was only half paying attention to the radio program. My 20-month-old daughter was in the car with me, and though she was pretty sleepy, she still demanded the other half of my attention. ]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program's guest (or so I surmised, since it was the person talking over the phone) was citing some recent finding by the &lt;a href="http://www.rae.es/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Real Academia Española&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that some number (or percentage?) of the websites (or webpages?) hosted in Spain is not available in (Castillian) Spanish, instead only being available in one or more of the other &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Spain"&gt;languages of various Spanish regions&lt;/a&gt; (Catalan, Basque, Galician, etc.) — and presumably a smattering of other languages, including English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication, of course, is that the existence of this number/percentage of non-Spanish webpages/sites is to some degree an undesirable or even unacceptable state of affairs. The program&amp;#39;s host and guest are in complete agreement about this, and enter into a discussion of some other study that they&amp;#39;d heard about — apparently conducted at some university in Spain, but mirrored by &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bilingualism+attention+memory&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholart"&gt;many studies elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; — demonstrating that bilingualism has positive effects on attention and memory. What they appear to be implying, of course, is that it&amp;#39;s a particular shame that some-such number/percentage of webpages/sites are not available in Spanish because this fails to promote bilingualism, and bilingualism is good for you. Don&amp;#39;t these Catalunians / Basques / Galicians / etc. want to do what&amp;#39;s good for them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as if he&amp;#39;d noticed that he&amp;#39;d basically imposed a requirement on Catalunians / Basques / Galicians / etc. that he wasn&amp;#39;t requiring of Castillians like himself, the program&amp;#39;s host further noted that he&amp;#39;d made a new year&amp;#39;s resolution to learn English. And he explained later that he understood that learning another language is difficult, that it requires &amp;quot;poniendo los codos en la mesa&amp;quot; — putting one&amp;#39;s elbows on the table, a prototypical image of a student deep in his studies. I know this is a saying, but at this point I did have to wonder how literally the host meant it. If he honestly thinks that the best way to learn another language is to hit the books, he&amp;#39;s not likely to learn much English. And if he and his guest honestly think that making more webpages/sites available in Spanish is going to promote bilingualism in Spain, they&amp;#39;re simply delusional. Making webpages/sites available in more than one language is not a service to (prospective) bilinguals; it&amp;#39;s a service to different groups of people, each of which may only speak one of those languages. People navigate to the page/site in the language they know best — do the program&amp;#39;s host and guest really think that any &lt;b&gt;significant number of people&lt;/b&gt; want to read content in a language that they understand less, or to read content in multiple languages just for the mind-enhancing fun of it? &lt;font color="green"&gt;[Please note the boldface, linguophilic would-be commenters!]&lt;/font&gt; Please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, if promoting bilingualism is really a concern, then is the number/percentage of webpages/sites &lt;i&gt;not in Spanish&lt;/i&gt; really the issue? I imagine (though of course I may be wrong) that the vast majority of webpages/sites hosted in Spain are Spanish-only, and I doubt the program's host and guest would find this fact undesirable (much less unacceptable).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Baković</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295590684465"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/01/oh_the_nanosail_popped_out.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f5396e8c870b2839</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Oh.

&lt;blockquote&gt;HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- Wednesday, Jan. 19 at 11:30 a.m. EST, engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., confirmed that the NanoSail-D nanosatellite ejected from Fast Affordable Scientific and Technology Satellite, FASTSAT. The ejection event occurred spontaneously and was identified this morning when engineers at the center analyzed onboard FASTSAT telemetry. The ejection of NanoSail-D also has been confirmed by ground-based satellite tracking assets&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, NASA is asking HAMs to help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amateur ham operators are asked to listen for the signal to verify NanoSail-D is operating. This information should be sent to the NanoSail-D dashboard at: http://nanosaild.engr.scu.edu/dashboard.htm. The NanoSail-D beacon signal can be found at 437.270 MHz. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I debated whether or not to talk about the George Lucas rumor going around because right now its just unsubstantiated gossip, I’m only hearing the story second-hand, and because I respect George Lucas a lot. The man was involved in some major capacity in at least 5 movies in my list of top 30 films of all time, including my the top 2 films on that list. And no other filmmaker has been a bigger influence on me. But it occurred to me that had this been a celebrity I didn’t care about, I would write about it, so I can’t play favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know what I’m talking about, here’s the story. Seth Rogen claims that he met with both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and that during that meeting, Lucas revealed that he was a big believer in the alleged Mayan prophecy that the world would end in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/movies/2011/01/18/16927446-wenn-story.html"&gt;According to Rogen&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“George Lucas sits down and seriously proceeds to talk for around 25  minutes about how he thinks the world is gonna end in the year 2012,  like, for real. He thinks it.“He’s going on about the tectonic plates and all the time Spielberg  is, like, rolling his eyes, like, ’My nerdy friend won’t shut up, I’m  sorry…’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I first thought he (Lucas) was joking… and then I totally realized  he was serious and then I started thinking, ’If you’re George Lucas and  you actually think the world is gonna end in a year, there’s no way you  haven’t built a spaceship for yourself… So I asked him… ’Can I have  a seat on it?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He claimed he didn’t have a spaceship, but there’s no doubt there’s a  Millennium Falcon in a garage somewhere with a pilot just waiting to  go… It’s gonna be him and Steven Spielberg and I’ll be blown up like  the rest of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now everyone’s talking about it…which I guess is a good thing because the overwhelming public sentiment seems to be that no intelligent person should really take this 2012 doomsday thing seriously and perhaps a little mockery will change Lucas’ mind on the thing if this story is legitimate in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s not that I seriously think Rogen would make up a story like this out of thin air to get media attention now that he’s got a movie out in theaters. I think he comes off as a really genuine guy and seems like he’s almost certainly a big fan of Lucas’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don’t think it’s made up. But it’s possible that Lucas and maybe Spielberg were having fun with him and Rogen didn’t pick up on it. Of course it’s also possible George Lucas really, truly believes the world will end in 2012. Though his actions over the past few years don’t seem to suggest that is the case. Then again, I find most believers in these sorts of impending doomsday ideas tend to live lives inconsistent with that belief just like religious people who believe death will bring them to paradise seem to go as out of their way to avoid death as any atheist. So it’s possible there’s a compartmentalization aspect to this where he’s kind of obsessed with reading books on the subject and is buying into some of it without really acting in a way that’s congruent with that belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to get into absurdity of these beliefs now. That’s been done to death. Contrary to what we hear from the delusional, in most ways the world is actually getting better. To quote Nerdfighter Hank Green:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 100 years the human lifespan has increased by over 35 years.  100 years ago the average lifespan was only 45 years. Now it’s almost  80. And that number is increasing every year. If it keeps increasing at  that same rate, the average lifespan of a child born in 2008 will be 98  years old.&lt;br&gt;
Teen pregnancy, smoke, and drug use have all decreased significantly since the 1990s.&lt;br&gt;
Rates of cancer have decreased steadily in the U.S. for 20 years and  it’s not just because people aren’t smoking as much, though that’s  certainly part of it. It’s also because new screening techniques that  can detect pre-cancerous lesions in the colon and also because of the  HPV vaccine which prevents the virus that causes cervical cancer.&lt;br&gt;
Small Pox once killed millions of people per year; now it has been completely eradicated. It literally does not exist anymore.&lt;br&gt;
Since 1990, global poverty rates have decreased by more than 30%. And they’re on-track to have decreas 40% by 2015.&lt;br&gt;
Divorce rates are much lower than people assume, and have consistently  dropped since the 1970′s in America. Only 20% of people who got married  in the 1980s got divorced.&lt;br&gt;
Violent crime rates dropped 5% between 2007 and 2008. And violent crime  rates have been dropping consistently every year since 1993&lt;br&gt;
The Red Cross collects 15 million blood donations per year. No one is  compensated for those donations, except with cookies and juice. People  just like helping other people.&lt;br&gt;
In 1970 there were only 400 breeding pairs of Bald Eagles left in  America, but the Endangered Species t effectively saved the species.  There are now more than 10,000 breeding pairs. During the same time  Whooping Cranes returned from a much more serious 50 birds total in the  entire world. There are now over 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in guess you were thinking that boy was our last hope, Yoda was right. There is another.&lt;/p&gt;

They've got one thing in common: they all contain lots of images of aborted fetuses, a common tactic used by these creatures to intimidate with horrible images. I'm not impressed. Here's a representative example, with the url to yet another horror show removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please read&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion is more than a "procedure" and it is rare that a pregnancy causes harm or death to a woman.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Maybe to better understand the murder that abortion truly is, you should study the photos in the link below.  It is easy to desensitize yourself and your readers and say it's just a procedure, and the fetus is just a "bunch of cells," but again, I ask that you study the photos in the link below, and I hope you are sickened with the real truth- Abortion IS Murder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:white;background:black"&gt;  URL deleted  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Abortion is more about greed and selfishness.  There are many many many families that would give anything to do a domestic adoption and offer prenatal care to a woman that did not want to keep/raise her baby.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No one says it better than Mother Teresa.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you live as you wish"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I pray that you will take the time to more fully understand what abortion is, and why the option to kill our nation's babies should not be an option at all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Sarah Dillon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Dillon is an ignorant hysteric, and she's awesomely stupid. She couldn't have written a letter better guaranteed to dissuade me from accepting her position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, never quote Mother Teresa at me — she was an evil hag who worshipped poverty, who did not help people except to encourage them to suffer more for her faith, while she lived in comfort and traveled far and wide to receive the accolades of the gullible. I would never find the words of that wicked woman persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the standard bullying tactics of waving bloody fetuses might cow the squeamish, but I&amp;#39;m a biologist. I&amp;#39;ve guillotined rats. I&amp;#39;ve held eyeballs in my hand and peeled them apart with a pair of scissors. I&amp;#39;ve used a wet-vac to clean up a lake of half-clotted blood from an exsanguinated dog. I&amp;#39;ve opened bodies and watched the intestines do their slow writhing dance, I&amp;#39;ve been elbow deep in blood, I&amp;#39;ve split open cats and stabbed them in the heart with a perfusion needle. I&amp;#39;ve extracted the brains of mice…with a pair of pliers. I&amp;#39;ve scooped brains out of buckets, I&amp;#39;ve counted dendrites in slices cut from the brains of dead babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to make me back down by trying to inspire revulsion with dead baby pictures? I look at them unflinchingly and see meat. And meat does not frighten me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vilest thing in the picture is the moron waving the sign and thinking they're making an argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/i_get_email_74.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/kkx-60Tr_VY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295583505954"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2011/01/a_nine_minute_rant_about_pseud.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf6595ed19b89149</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A Nine Minute Rant About Pseudoscience...</title><published>2011-01-21T04:03:05Z</published><updated>2011-01-21T04:03:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/PMeJtgAYm_g/a_nine_minute_rant_about_pseud.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2011/01/a_nine_minute_rant_about_pseud.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of you lovelies sent this to me.

One of the major mechanisms producing this relationship is that different species use differing resources, such that their complementary use of resources uses the total resource pool more thoroughly, thus converting more resources into biomass. Resource preference is the product of evolution and how organisms have adapted to using various resources can influence the strength of the diversity-function.In a recent paper in Nature, Dominique Gravel and colleagues test how the evolution of specialization versus general resource use affect the strength of the diversity-function relationship. They use bacteria strains that have undergone evolution on diverse resources (generalist) versus on a singular resource (specialist). The resources in their case are different carbon substrates.Assemblages of generalists were able to use many available resources and generally had greater productivity than specialist assemblages. Generalists also show an increasing relationship between diversity and productivity, because no generalist used all resources and they still showed some preferences. Combining multiple such generalists meant that more of the total resource pool was consumed. Specialists also resulted in the positive relationship, but a much steeper one. Because specialist use many fewer carbon substrates, additional specialists meant that new resources were tapped into. Thus increasing specialist diversity resulted in more new resources being consumed than with the generalist species.While these results are logical, they are important for two reasons. First is that the strength of the relationship between diversity and function is mechanistically determined by the resource use efficiency of individual strains, and how many of the total substrates they can use. The mechanisms producing different relationships in previous experiments were hypothesized after the results analyzed, as opposed to being predicted. Second, recent work has shown that evolutionary history seems to be a better explanation of community function than the number of species. These results show how the history of evolution can have important consequences for function.Gravel, D., Bell, T., Barbera, C., Bouvier, T., Pommier, T., Venail, P., &amp;amp; Mouquet, N. (2010).

The chemical community still mourns; it is clear from these post-mortem publications that Fagnou&amp;#39;s - and his clearly dedicated and talented graduate students and post-docs - brilliance lives on. The chemistry that Fagnou has truly spearheaded, direct  C-H functionalization, is a method of forming C-C, C-N, C-B, etc bonds without  having to prepare one of the coupling partners, as in traditional  transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.  Palladium, rhodium  and ruthenium are commonly used catalysts in direct C-H  functionalization reactions.  Fagnou has published a great deal on  arylation reactions of a wide variety of substrates and even a bit on direct benzylation reactions.  Some fairly recent reviews are linked in a previous post.A recent publication in Journal of Organic Chemistry (doi: 10.1021/jo102081a), &amp;quot;Predictable and Site-Selective Functionalization of Poly(hetero)arene Compounds by Palladium Catalysis,&amp;quot; published by David Lapointe and coworkers, explores the development of two approaches to selectively functionalizing multi-ring systems - 1) using site-selective reaction conditions, and 2) a pathway with a particular order of reactivity according to a concerted metalation-deprotonation (CMD) mechanism. It is well-known in the field that a great many (hetero)arenes can be functionalized with (painfully) rigorous fine-tuning of the catalyst, ligand, additives, and other reaction conditions.  Some substrates have been more difficult to functionalize than others, and selectivity of particular positions on these rings is always an issue - this publication tackles both issues.To explore site-selective functionalization, the group used compounds with more than one available C-H bond for direct functionalization, and using multiple protocols specific for specific C-H bonds (Larossa&amp;#39;s conditions for C2 arylation of indoles, Gaunt&amp;#39;s Cu-catalyzed C3 arylation of indoles which is actually selective for meta to amido groups, and their own protocols for arylation of perfluorobenzenes and aromatic N-oxides) were able to successfully and selectively functionalize targeted C-H bonds in moderate yields.  Here is an example with some decent yields, with reaction times ranging from 16 - 24 hours: The alternative approach relies upon the CMD pathway as the operative mechanism, which favors electron-deficient substrates.  Several years ago, Echavarren published support of this mechanism by finding a preference for the most acidic C-H bond and requirement for a carbonate base, and Fagnou established the use of a pivalate additive, which was speculated to play a crucial role via CMD.   A recent mechanistic paper with aromatic N-oxides as the substrates strongly supports this mechanism.   The metal first inserts into the aryl-X bond, as expected, and in the key transition state, the pivalate coordinated to the metal deprotonates the C-H bond while the palladium forms a bond to the same C.  Reductive elimination (not shown) releases the arylated product.In the current paper DFT calculations were found to agree quite well compared to competition reaction results of a series of heterocycles to elucidate the order of reactivity of the substrates.  Those presented in the paper are as follows, in order of reactivity - this is extremely convenient for the synthetic chemist who would like to utilize this chemistry.  And it&amp;#39;s just plain neat - the kind of thing that will hopefully end up in a textbook someday. (Note: the last two substrates are either switched in the text or switched in the image - they don&amp;#39;t agree in the paper and I haven&amp;#39;t looked at the supporting information closely.)Reaction conditions: 0.5 eq. of each of two heteroarenes in the competition experiment, 0.125 eq. 4-bromotrifluorobenzene, Pd(OAc)2 5 mol%, PCy3.HBF4 (10 mol%), PivOH (30 mol%), K2CO3 (1.5 eq.), DMA (0.3M), 100ºC. And finally, for an example of the method in action - note that the difference between using this method and the previously described is that here, there aren&amp;#39;t necessarily general optimized conditions available for each of the substrate classes here.  Examples of a few of these are peppered throughout the arylation literature but they aren&amp;#39;t like indoles, pyridines, N-oxides, perfluorobenzenes, imidazoles, and pyrazoles and don&amp;#39;t have their own special set of conditions (that I&amp;#39;m aware of at the moment).  Yields of included substrates range from 65-80%. Instead of optimizing conditions for each, the site of reactivity can be predicted with good specificity - here the indolizine C-H bond over the more electron-rich thiophene&amp;#39;s:Instead of an aryl bromide, benzyl chloride can be used as the coupling partner as well, with published yields from 55-84%....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s child abuse of a very high order, worse even than Freshwater’s because the children are so much younger.  Those kids are screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

He announced the nominees for "Best Alternative Album" and I was, in a word, disappointed. Who were these bands? What the hell was that lameass shit coming out of the speakers? In what world did what they produced qualify as "Alternative Rock?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be fair, I don't pay attention to the Grammys. I don't pay much attention to what music is popular at all; my car stereo is never on FM because I have lots of CDs and an iPod I can plug into it. I only listen to what I choose to listen to and I discover new stuff through a combination of serendipity, suggestions from friends, and Pandora Radio. I am, put simply, not in touch with the modern music scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet I still cannot stop myself from asking one very important question: at what point, exactly, did "Alternative Rock" get redefined as "Ironically self-aware cutesy pussy hipster pop?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:right;margin-left:1em;text-align:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TTjbxOpZ6UI/AAAAAAAABEI/b43XjbjhY3c/s1600/kurt_cobain.jpg" style="clear:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TTjbxOpZ6UI/AAAAAAAABEI/b43XjbjhY3c/s200/kurt_cobain.jpg" width="183"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;Fuck Courtney.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;See, I was around for the origin of Alternative Rock as a genre. I was a spectator to its very genesis, and when it burst out of the 80s like Athena from the head of Zeus it was something new and different and weird and exciting. It was "alternative" because that's exactly what it presented to the tired stadium rock, glam rock, and hair metal of the previous decade. It took many different forms even in those early decades, but they all had one thing in common: they were a forceful push back against a decade of overly-polished turds. They created music in their own way and forged a niche for themselves in a market that was initially hostile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Granted, there was a lot of music industry politicking going on; Alternative Rock couldn't have existed without David Geffen, but that doesn't subtract from the roughness of so much early Alternative. Sure, it eventually gog popular enough to attract imitators and hangers-on (I'm looking at you, Stone Temple Pilots), but the core of Alternative Rock was a raw outpouring of real emotion into music that, mostly, kicked asses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially, Alternative Rock had &lt;i&gt;balls&lt;/i&gt;. Mostly. The jury is still out on Beck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kurt Cobain lived under a bridge and purposely wrote Nirvana's second album to be so fucking raw that it would be a commercial disaster (it wasn't, and it's the better of their two records in my opinion). Sinead O'Connor tore up a picture of the Pope on Saturday Night Live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:left;text-align:left"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TTjgzHIURsI/AAAAAAAABEM/5XvU4fcYTok/s1600/billy-corgan.jpg" style="clear:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TTjgzHIURsI/AAAAAAAABEM/5XvU4fcYTok/s200/billy-corgan.jpg" width="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;Billy Corgan has no balls&lt;br&gt;but Billy Corgan still has more &lt;br&gt;balls than Vampire Weekend.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The Smashing Pumpkins put out a two-disc concept album called &lt;i&gt;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&lt;/i&gt; and one of the singles was titled "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" and it was &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; so much fucking cooler than what passes for Alternative these days. Sure it sounded lame on the outside but it was full of rage, nihilism, existential angst, and hard, distorted, driving guitarwork. It was awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking through the nominees and winners for Best Alternative Album for the last few years, though, I'm at a loss for words. The awards are filled with lame, ball-less bullshit from irritating little hipster kids. Arcade Fire? The Black Keys? Vampire Weekend? A band called Vampire fucking Weekend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:right;text-align:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TTjoaJ2S1hI/AAAAAAAABEQ/KPUIpwg9UT0/s1600/TheBlackKeys.jpg" style="clear:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/TTjoaJ2S1hI/AAAAAAAABEQ/KPUIpwg9UT0/s200/TheBlackKeys.jpg" width="174"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;This man is not a fucking rock star.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It sounded bad enough, but I paused the video and went to YouTube to listen to some of their music. Names can be deceiving, after all, and I figured I should see if maybe they didn't suck as badly as they sounded like they sucked. I wasted my benefit of the doubt, however, as they may be even worse than they sound like. Wussy, twee, quirky little hipster shit played by slick, smug, self-satisfied bitchboys who have no business going near a rock album much less being labeled "Alternative Rock." It doesn't fit a category with that name in any conceivable way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all, what is this shit an alternative to? If you want to get technical, everything is an alternative to something else, but I've already covered the paradigm-shifting change that early Alternative brought to the tired and static 80s. It became pop, but it had to displace something else to do it. This shit, far as I can tell, just walzted onto the pop music landscape, sidled up, and became part of the scene. It didn't have to fight for its existence, it didn't have to be hated by the mainstream, it spent no time in the margins justifying itself. There were no hard knocks, no struggle, no oppression above which to rise. Let's liken the original Alternative to the original &lt;i&gt;Rocky&lt;/i&gt;; using this Stallonified analogy, modern Alternative is &lt;i&gt;Rambo III.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there's the rock angle. This shit &lt;i&gt;is in no way rock music&lt;/i&gt;. It is weak, cutesy little pop dreck that happens to maybe have a guitar in the somewhere. Maybe. Most of it is a couple of real drums away from being that piece of shit "Fireflies" by Owl City, AKA some skinny little bitch in his parent's basement. The shit featured on Colbert had no drive, no rage, no balls, no desire to stick it to the man. It was overproduced, obscenely self-aware, and just exuded an aura of "Aren't we so fucking clever?" It didn't look like rock, it didn't sound like rock; I fail to see how it can be labeled rock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's make an axiom of rock: honest angst and legitimate nihilism are always more awesome than self-obsessed irony. Rock requires, if nothing else, some kind of &lt;i&gt;heart, &lt;/i&gt;some kind of &lt;i&gt;soul.&lt;/i&gt; The overproduced, drippy, pussy shit I saw on Colbert last week does not deserve the mantle of Alternative Rock. These goddamned hipsters have no legitimate claim to the title laid on Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder, Chris Cornell, and even fucking Noel and Liam Gallagher. At least they cursed a lot and got into fights with each other. These smiley, artsy dipshits are polluting the fucking waters of rock with their chickenshit spew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And stay off my lawn, you damn kids!&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-501021967560885970?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295579256749"><id gr:original-id="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/toumai-and-the-sabercats/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/931b6a4ab358c347</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Toumai and the Sabercats</title><published>2011-01-20T20:32:06Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T20:32:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/9EVt0Ixfk2k/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/toumai-and-the-sabercats/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">“They fight!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could force a [z] pronunciation by spelling the nickname Tasie. Trouble is, that would also force a vowel change, so that it'd look as if it should be pronounced tay-zee.  They could solve both problems by spelling the nickname Tazzie, but then it would no longer look like a shortened form of Tasmania.  So instead they go for the spelling/pronunciation mismatch.  Maybe it's deliberate, a trap for the uninformed tourist trying to sound like an insider.  More likely it's just the typical (or stereotypical) Australian method of forming nicknames combined with an independent spirit that thumbs its metaphorical nose at sound/symbol conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#006600"&gt;[Since a number of people in the comments below ask why I have not come in to address the matter (people may be aware that I spent something like a year and a half in Australia in bits and pieces during the time I worked with Rodney Huddleston on &lt;a href="http://www.cambridge.org/uk/linguistics/cgel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;i&gt;CGEL&lt;/i&gt;]), let me just say here that I addressed the matter myself in a passage that appeared in &lt;i&gt;CGEL&lt;/i&gt; on page 1636.  There is indeed a general rule of voicing intervocalic fricatives in embellished clippings.  A clipping is a word formed from another word by leaving part of it out: &lt;i&gt;ut&lt;strike&gt;ility truck&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/i&gt; yields &lt;i&gt;ute&lt;/i&gt;, the Australian for "pickup truck".  An embellished clipping forms a clipping and then embellishes it with an ending: &lt;i&gt;French&lt;strike&gt; letter&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ("condom") yields &lt;i&gt;frenchie&lt;/i&gt; by addition of &lt;i&gt;-ie&lt;/i&gt;,  &lt;i&gt;reg&lt;strike&gt;istration&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/i&gt; yields &lt;i&gt;rego&lt;/i&gt; ("car registration") by addition of &lt;i&gt;-o&lt;/i&gt;, and so on. When a fricative like &lt;i&gt;-s-&lt;/i&gt; falls between the clipping and the embellishment, it is always voiced. The embellished clipping from &lt;i&gt;position&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;possie&lt;/i&gt;, the one from &lt;i&gt;Australian&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;Aussie&lt;/i&gt;, and they are all pronounced with [z]. Perhaps the most surprising is the embellished clipping formed from &lt;i&gt;afternoon&lt;/i&gt;: it is pronounced [a:vo] (and usually spelled &lt;i&gt;arvo&lt;/i&gt;, since Australian English is non-rhotic). —GKP]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sally Thomason</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295576255820"><id gr:original-id="http://bigthink.com/ideas/26591">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42aabc64397f2fff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Study: Your Genes Help Pick Your Friends</title><published>2011-01-20T19:06:48Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T19:06:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/q1JYp-LDK9s/26591" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/26591"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">How much of you resides between your ears?

If you’re having trouble coming up with an answer, you aren’t alone. In a study of K-12 graders, the majority believed engineers build buildings and fix cars; 10% of the students confused engineers with train operators. Another study asked teachers “What kinds of work do engineers do for their jobs?”  Between 25 and 35% of the surveyed teachers selected clean teeth, arrange flowers, sell food and make pizza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The studies’ results are startling, but what does this have to do with film? The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) recently launched a new website (&lt;a href="http://www.engineeringmessages.org/"&gt;www.engineeringmessages.org&lt;/a&gt;) devoted to changing the conversation about engineering. The NAE worked with a market research and brand development company to create new messages and taglines that challenge common misperceptions of engineering. Which got us thinking, what films support positive messages about engineering?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Nd5tVw2_LmQ?version%3D3&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=390" width="480" height="390"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, there’s a whole &lt;a href="http://www.designnotes.com/companion/whatare-movies.html"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of films with engineer characters. But simply having an engineer character isn’t going to change the conversation about engineering, now is it? Research has found that adults and teens do not readily associate engineering with problem-solving, creativity or having a positive impact on society. That’s a big hurdle to overcome but we found a few films up to the challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did you know the Batmobile was created by an engineer? In &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/span&gt;, Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman) is the mechanical engineer behind all of Batman’s superhero equipment. Fox even developed the technology behind Batman’s cape, a type of “memory cloth” that becomes rigid when electrical currents pass through it. Fox is a problem-solver, he’s creative and he has an amazing positive impact on society; afterall, he’s the man who built Batman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another superhero brought his engineering background straight to his alter ego – Iron Man. Tony Stark is one cool, creative, problem-solving engineer. In &lt;i&gt;Iron Man&lt;/i&gt;, Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by the Ten Rings terrorist group. During his captivity he works with another engineer, Yinsen (who implanted the electromagnet into Stark’s chest in order to save his life), to create the Iron Man suit prototype, which allows Stark to esape. Stark then develops the suit further and uses it to become a superhero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another film proves engineers can be heroes without the mask and cape (or armored suit). &lt;i&gt;A Bug’s Life&lt;/i&gt; features an inventive ant, Flik, whose engineering skills save his fellow ants. Flik is a wonderful example of an engineer – especially for children. He’s creative and he loves to solve problems. Flik builds a model bird to scare away the grasshoppers – who demand the ants’ food as payment for “protection.” It ultimately doesn’t work but Flik’s try is commendable. At the end of the film, one of his inventions – a grain harvester – is adopted by the colony for use, which has a positive impact on the ant community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, these three films aren't the only ones with positive portrayals of engineers. But we think it’s time we hear from you. What films do you see as changing the conversation about engineering?&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-5835981399581294982?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Just to explain a bit of the background. Rowthorn is an economist, and his paper is basically a model of what would would happen if you have a gene (strictly speaking [and for Bjørn's benefit], an allele) that predisposes for membership of a group, and if that group has high reproduction.

What he shows is that the gene spreads incredibly quickly - just 10 generations after it appears, 80% of the population have it. After 20 generations, 95% have it, and it keeps increasing until that figure reaches 100%.

Because the gene spreads, membership of the group increases. It starts off a little slower, and never quite reaches 100% (because even gene carriers can opt out in this model). 

Since there is a gene for religion, and the religious (especially the ultra-conservatives) have more kids, you can easily see how this model directly relates to the real world.

And that, Dear Reader, is why 95% of the world's population are Orthodox Jews!

Oh. Alright there is clearly something wrong with the model, but that's OK. Models are usually wrong, and the fun part comes in trying to figure out why. And this model is particularly interesting because it touches on a number of popular misconceptions.

Some are specific to this model but there's also a much bigger issue underlying all this: just why is there so much variation in how religious people are, if (as some theorists will have you believe) religion is so beneficial?

But first, let's look at some specific problems with the assumptions in this model. First off, it isn't really a model of religion, despite the title of the paper. It's a model of conservatism.

Rowthorn starts from some basic assumptions. That global birthrates have fallen, but they have fallen more slowly among the most religious (and not at all among certain sects like Orthodox Jews and the Amish). That conservatism and religion are inextricably linked (and that they have a simple genetic basis). And that religion is inextricably linked to high birth rates.

A quick survey just of European history will quickly show that the last two assumptions don't hold. There have been countless examples of religious anti-conservative movements - the Protestant reformation is just the most obvious example, but there are numerous others, like the anti-slavery movement and the 12th century reformation.

Religion is invented by people, and religion can be radical and innovative - according to their needs.

And of course religion does not necessarily promote fertility. Throughout most of its history, the Catholic Church has been at pains to promote the moral value of 'sexual continence'. The most religious people eschewed sex, and were packed off in their tens of thousands to monasteries and nunneries - places not renowned for their fecundity! Not just Europe either - Burma even now has around 400,000 monks.

So the link between religion and fertility is a cultural one, and it's a product of our recent history. Cultural innovation in recent decades has been tied to non-religion. Conservative people by their nature are likely to shun innovative lifestyles, and are more likely to adopt the lifestyles prevalent in the past. From the perspective of the early 21st century, that means things like religion and traditional families.

One of the problems with Rowthorn's model is that assumes that there are only two groups. A high fertility, religious (conservative) group, and a low fertility, non-religious (liberal) group. People who carry the 'gene' can switch out of the religious group, but their descendants will still be more likely to switch back in to that same group.

But what happens if the genes for conservatism and religion are not inextricably linked? What happens if new cultures arise that are religious, but do not promote fertility, or which are conservative, but do not promote religion?

And, of course, what happens if there is not really a gene for religion at all? Are the Amish really genetically disposed to be Amish? Or is it simply that they have been brought up to be Amish? Even if they are, will their offspring be more likely to rejoin the Amish, or will they simply be more likely to join some other traditional cultural group (steam engine enthusiasts, perhaps).

This is not to knock Rowthorn's paper, which gives a great insight into gene-culture interaction. It shows very nicely that a gene can spread faster than the culture that promotes it.

But it is a caution against running away with conclusions about a complex world based upon a simple, unvalidated model.

It raises a much bigger question, too. Just suppose there really is a culture that is 'best' (from an evolutionary perspective). And just suppose that there is a personality that is predisposed to that culture, and a gene that predisposes to that personality. Well then, if such a thing exists, why isn't everybody like that?

After all, evolution is ruthlessly efficient. A gene that reduces fitness by only 1% will be eliminated in just 10 generations, and will be carried by just 100 individuals. There's an excellent paper published a few years ago that tackles question of why on earth people have different personalities (see the footnote for reference).

After ruling out genetic drift and random mutation, the authors conclude that the most likely reason different people have different personalities is that there is no one 'optimal' strategy. In different times, or in different places, different approaches might be best.

This effect is called 'balancing selection', and it results in a number of different 'evolutionary stable strategies' - i.e. personalities.

What's more, these stable strategies often show negative frequency dependence. What that means is that the benefit of having a particular personality decreases the more that other people have the same personality.

In other words, human society creates a kind of ecosystem, and different personalities occupy different niches in that ecosystem.

Even then there are some nuances. Reproductive fitness is not just a question of numbers of offspring. Each organism has to make a choice of whether to invest resources in growth, in reproduction, or in survival. The optimum balance depends on - you guessed it - the particular environment (both physical and cultural).

Of course, they also go on to point out that there is no direct link between genes and personality. Rather, they suggest that multiple genes act to influence 'personality mechanisms' - like the 'startle reflex'. Depending on the environmental setting, these contribute to personality traits (the startle reflex has been linked to political conservatism). But even these personality traits are then further influenced by the environment to produce the end product - behaviour.

In other words, genes act at a very basic level to create a brain tool kit. These tool kits can generate a number of different personalities (and, ultimately, behaviour) depending on the environment.

And the reason you have the toolkit that you have - which is unique to you and may, depending on your environment, have resulted in you being religious or nonreligious - is because the components of your particular brain toolkit helped your ancestors to survive.

None of us, whether religious or non-religious, are maladaptive - from an evolutionary perspective, at least!

(Well, except those of you out there reading this who have congenitally low IQ - but that's a different story and you'll have to read the paper yourself to find out why!)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A religious right-wing conservative State Senator is trying to make [death-with-dignity] illegal," writes a reader. "A state senator, along with a couple of anti-choice religious-based organizations, are freeping (artificially inflating the #s by getting out-of-area votes) a poll on a newspaper site in Kalispell, with a plan to get a big headline that they won the poll. Normally I wouldn't bother with such stuff. But Montana is the smallest of small town politics--and every little thing matters."&lt;/p&gt;

One such developmental abnormality is "heterosis," a.k.a. 'hybrid vigor.' In general, heterosis refers to any trait in hybrids that is larger than the average of the two parents' (or the parents' species) values for that trait. The phenomenon was recognized in plant domestication as far back as the 19th century - crosses between different plant (namely corn) strains produced hybrid strains with much greater yield than their parent species.Implicit in the term is that heterosis, or larger size, is a more adaptive condition than found in the parents. Here's what the late, brilliant Theodosius Dobzhansky (1950: on hybrids: 557) had to say on the matter.The advisability of applying the term "heterosis" to cases in which heterozygotes are larger in body size, or show "increases" in any "traits," but no evidence of higher adaptive value compared to the corresponding homozygotes, is open to question. Perhaps the word "luxuriance" would be a better designation for such cases, the word "heterosis" or "euheterosis" to be used for adaptive superiority of heterozygotes to homozygotes. . . . it is clear that the mechanisms underlying euheterosis and luxuriance are quite different.I wonder if these luxuriant (not heterotic) hybrids also love diamonds, yoga and kopi luwak coffee?

For public consumption, they say that  they favor “teaching the controversy”. However, almost any time they control the forum, they pretty ruthlessly make it impossible for one to hear anything but their own spin on a topic. Now, they are asking for comments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when the DI published their textbook supplement, “Explore Evolution”, Paul Nelson made a comment here about setting up a means to allow “debate” of the materials. Within a couple of hours of that, I had set up &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=5133;st=750" rel="external "&gt;a thread&lt;/a&gt; at “After the Bar Closes” to permit just that. The DI does have a page labeled “Further Debate” on their “Explore Evolution” site, but all that provides is a set of links of responses from the DI to criticism of their book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discovery Institute Senior Fellow William Dembski’s weblog, “Uncommon Descent”, has comments enabled, but the moderation there is generally so ham-fisted that only a few voices of dissent have lasted more than a week or two. The various inconsistencies of moderation and proclivity to stifle dissent have their &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=4d38c2598b1c9a37;act=ST;f=14;t=5141" rel="external "&gt;own thread&lt;/a&gt; at “After the Bar Closes”., and discussion of content at UD has occupied three long-running threads (&lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=1274;st=29970" rel="external "&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=5735;st=4620" rel="external "&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=4d38c3678b7f4601;act=ST;f=14;t=6300" rel="external "&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the DI’s “Evolution News and Views” (EN&amp;amp;V) blog has dispensed entirely with the concept of comments. However, a &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2011/01/changes-coming-to-evolution-ne.html" rel="external "&gt;post there&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the DI is posed to break with their tendentious tradition, to at least some degree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course, you might want to discuss it with the scientists and scholars themselves. To that end, comments will be allowed on selected articles. All comments are held for moderation. The debate over evolution and intelligent design attracts all kinds, including those who detract from the conversation by their obnoxious behavior. In order to maintain a higher level of discourse, we will not publish comments that use foul language, ad hominem attacks, threats, or are otherwise uncivil.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given their past history in moderation practice, though, I’d recommend that you compose any comments destined for EN&amp;amp;V in a text editor so that you can hang on to your work, without assuming that they will post and archive it on their site. To help gauge just how far they’ve come from their earlier appreciation of dissent, I would further recommend that you paste a copy of any such comment into &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?s=4d38c3678b7f4601;act=ST;f=14;t=7198" rel="external "&gt;the thread I’ve created&lt;/a&gt; at “After the Bar Closes” for the purpose of providing an open forum and archive. Then, we will be able to compare what makes it through moderation to some approximation of what they actually receive in the inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite instance of this pun is S. F. Gull, A. N. Lasenby and C. J. L. Doran, "&lt;a href="http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~clifford/publications/abstracts/imag_numbs.html"&gt;Imaginary Numbers are not Real - the Geometric Algebra of Spacetime&lt;/a&gt;",  &lt;em&gt;Found.

You cannot free a man who dwells in a desert and is an unfeeling brute.  There is no liberty except the liberty of some one making his way towards something.  Such a man can be set free if you will teach him the meaning of thirst, and how to trace a path to a well.  Only then will he embark upon a course of action that will not be without significance.  You could not liberate a stone if there were no law of gravity -- for where will the stone go, once it is quarried?" -&lt;i&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exupery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Gravity, on the largest scales, rules everything in the Universe.  You and I -- and everything else in our galaxy -- started as tiny fluctuations in the young Universe, where maybe we were only 0.001% denser than average, represented by the blue spots, below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/20080513_wwt2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/20080513_wwt2-thumb-500x375-60480.jpeg" width="500" height="375" alt="20080513_wwt2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;WMAP&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the power of gravity, this little bit of extra mass is better at attracting the mass around it than other places, and pulls it in on itself.  Over time, as it gathers more and more of the mass around it, matter begins to collapse, forming galaxies, stars, and eventually, things like you and me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/sim3dnew.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/sim3dnew-thumb-500x324-60483.png" width="500" height="324" alt="sim3dnew.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how far back can we see?  Normally, when we look places in the night sky, all sorts of relatively &lt;i&gt;nearby&lt;/i&gt; things are in the way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/Horsehead%20AA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/Horsehead%20AA-thumb-500x530-60485.jpeg" width="500" height="530" alt="Horsehead AA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.allred-astro.com/gpage1.html"&gt;Tyler Allred&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stars, dust, gas, nebulae, and (relatively) nearby galaxies all get in the way of our attempts to look as far as possible into the distant Universe.  But we've gone and found a few patches in the sky with no bright stars, no gas, very little dust, and no close-or-intermediate-distance galaxies.  And for a few of them, we've pointed our favorite telescope at them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/Hst_sts82.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/Hst_sts82-thumb-500x405-60487.jpeg" width="500" height="405" alt="Hst_sts82.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm talking about the Hubble Space Telescope, of course!  Capable of seeing almost exactly the same wavelengths of light that our eyes can, the Hubble Space Telescope spent literally &lt;i&gt;days&lt;/i&gt; staring at the same blank patch of sky, collecting single photons one-at-a-time.  And after enough days had passed by, this is what it found.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hudf_300dpi-thumb-500x500-60490.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As always, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hudf_300dpi.jpeg"&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; for the full-size version.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image -- known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field"&gt;Hubble Ultra Deep Field&lt;/a&gt; -- contains about 10,000 very distant galaxies.  And honestly, it probably contains more that are even more distant, but invisible to us.  Why's that?  There are actually two reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/starrays.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/starrays-thumb-500x393-60492.gif" width="500" height="393" alt="starrays.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, the farther away from something you are, the dimmer it appears.  This is actually severe; if something's &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt; as far away, it's going to appear just &lt;i&gt;one-fourth&lt;/i&gt; as bright, and if it's &lt;i&gt;four times&lt;/i&gt; as far away, it'll be only &lt;i&gt;one-sixteenth&lt;/i&gt; as bright!  So for the most distant objects, even days of observing are enough to get only some of the very brightest ones.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a second reason, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/redshift.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/redshift.gif" width="500" height="366" alt="redshift.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/doppler.htm"&gt;Ned Wright&lt;/a&gt;'s amazing cosmology tutorial.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wavelength.&lt;/b&gt;  You know, since the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/q_a_how_is_the_universe_so_big.php"&gt;Universe is expanding&lt;/a&gt;, that the farther away an object is, the &lt;i&gt;redder&lt;/i&gt; its light appears to us.  At some point, you're looking at objects so far away that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the visible light gets shifted into the infrared part of the spectrum, and becomes invisible to us!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/superfargalaxies.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/superfargalaxies.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="superfargalaxies.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we look in detail at this image, we're able to find some extremely &lt;i&gt;faint&lt;/i&gt;, and very, very &lt;i&gt;red&lt;/i&gt; objects.  They're not only located all over the place,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/superfar1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/superfar1-thumb-500x400-60498.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="superfar1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but they're also located in very close proximity to much closer, brighter, less red galaxies!  Why is that?  Well, my friends, this is why gravity is the telescope's best friend!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hs-2011-04-a-web_print.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hs-2011-04-a-web_print-thumb-500x400-60500.jpeg" width="500" height="400" alt="hs-2011-04-a-web_print.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out in space, &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/cosmology/distant-galaxies/2011/04/full/"&gt;gravity from massive galaxies acts like a magnifying lens&lt;/a&gt;, making galaxies that would otherwise be too dim appear brighter and, in many cases, larger, allowing us to see them!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These galaxies, circled above, are the most distant ones &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; discovered, with a measured redshift of &lt;b&gt;eight&lt;/b&gt;, meaning that the visible, red light we see was emitted as extreme &lt;i&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/i&gt; light, and the expanding Universe has moved it out of the ultraviolet, past violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, and almost into the infrared by time it reaches our eyes!  A galaxy at a redshift of eight, for those interested, corresponds to looking at them when the Universe was only 600 million years old; more than &lt;b&gt;13 billion years ago&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hs-2011-04-b-print.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/hs-2011-04-b-print-thumb-500x371-60502.jpeg" width="500" height="371" alt="hs-2011-04-b-print.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's more.  In addition to the ultra-red galaxies, circled in green, scientists have also identified &lt;i&gt;purely infrared candidates&lt;/i&gt;, invisible to our eyes, circled in red above.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would we confirm something so distant that the light from it is invisible to our eyes?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/people.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra/people-thumb-500x332-60504.jpeg" width="500" height="332" alt="people.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You build a deep space telescope with infrared eyes, which is exactly what &lt;a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/"&gt;the James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, Hubble's successor, is going to be!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's wonderful that Hubble is giving us hints of this now, but I can hardly wait to see what the next generation of space telescopes will teach us about the Universe.  In the meantime, the extra magnifying glass of gravity is our only hope!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/01/the_telescopes_best_friend_gra.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295561665178"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=18596">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2c6e6e6a1b6dae3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Activism"/><category term="Random Asides"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Stuff You'll Like"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="people"/><title type="html">The Skeptic Next Door: Sadie Crabtree</title><published>2011-01-20T21:20:51Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T21:20:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2011/01/the-skeptic-next-door-sadie-crabtree/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=62b888e3787e2c30b9bf43f847fdfca5&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We haven’t had a good old-fashioned &lt;strong&gt;Skeptic Next Door&lt;/strong&gt; feature in a while and I just happened to make a new friend who lives just down the road from me that I thought my Skepchick pals might like to meet! She is a skeptic and she is passionate about making a difference in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to introduce to you the fabulous, &lt;strong&gt;Sadie Crabtree&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and Sadie doesn’t just have a cool name, she has a cool job too! &lt;img src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/11/sadie1small.jpg" alt="sadie 1" width="280" height="420"&gt;She is the brand-spankin’ new director of communications at the JREF. For those of you unfamiliar, the JREF is the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The JREF is known for its work investigating paranormal claims (the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html"&gt;Million Dollar Challenge&lt;/a&gt;) and for promoting logic, critical thinking and skepticism in education and in the media. The organization is loved and respected in the skeptical community, not only because it was formed by the amazing, James Randi himself but also because of &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Meetings&lt;/em&gt; or what you hear us refer to lovingly as, &lt;em&gt;TAM&lt;/em&gt;. TAM is organized by the JREF and began in Las Vegas but has recently expanded to include yearly events in London and Australia as well. TAM is the quintessential conference on skepticism and critical thinking that has proven itself not only a megaphone for blasting out the latest hot-topics in skepticism and for educating the public in the classical skeptical topics but it has helped fill a gap in this ever-growing society of critical thinkers by becoming a very important social gathering for self-identified skeptics and those in search of intellectual enlightenment. Many skeptics, freethinkers and atheists consider it one of the only times each year when they can rub elbows with their favorite scientists, authors, bloggers, podcasters and leaders of this movement and where they feel they can truly speak their mind in an environment of like-minded individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, let’s all welcome a new addition into the skeptosphere, Sadie Crabtree!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you define the term skeptic? / Do you consider yourself a skeptic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say I’m a skeptic, I mean I’m someone who investigates ideas before I’m willing to accept them, even if they’re widely believed by others. &lt;img src="http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/7838/sadie3small.jpg" alt="sadie 3" width="280" height="420"&gt;Sometimes what’s considered common knowledge is probably right, like the scientific consensus on global warming. Sometimes it’s probably wrong, like the vast majority of Americans who believe in a supernatural power. You have to consider the evidence for yourself. Of course most people don’t have the resources and time to dig through volumes of original research on something like evolution or homeopathy, but what we can all do is consider some basic questions about any claim, like: is the source of this claim profiting from people believing in this? What previously proven scientific facts would have to be false for this claim to be true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited about the work we’re doing at the JREF right now, because we’re building on the work James Randi and the Foundation have done to bring this kind of thinking to a mass audience. The Million Dollar Challenge is one of those questions that helps ordinary people sort out the nonsense—if what this person says is true, why haven’t they applied for the prize? And it’s really stuck in the public consciousness. We’re expanding on that by working with educators to promote critical thinking in schools, in ways that engage young people when they’re learning the pattens of thinking they’ll rely on for the rest of their lives. And we’re looking strategically at how to communicate the value of skepticism to more people more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What first got you interested in organized skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got interested in skepticism because I was interested in science. The really amazing stuff that you can hardly believe is possible. I mean, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole"&gt;black holes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity"&gt;special relativity&lt;/a&gt; are totally ridiculous. And, seriously, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"&gt;double-slit experiment&lt;/a&gt;? This sense of wonder about how strange and amazing the world is, and wanting to understand and connect with it, I think, is the same feeling that leads other people to want to learn about ghosts and fringe pseudoscience. For a while when I was younger, I was interested in those things too, but as I learned more I understood why those were two very different approaches to the world. One way of thinking fetishizes the unexplained, and stops right there to wallow in the mystery of it all. Science finds things that are awesome and unexplained, rejects the bad explanations, and keeps exploring, until what was unexplained is understood, and there is a whole new frontier of things we don’t understand that we never would have seen if we hadn’t kept going. Black holes are a million times cooler than astrology, and we wouldn’t even know they were there if we didn’t have a way to reject the bad explanations of what’s up in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s part of why I think skeptics should talk more about what we’re for rather than just what we’re against. People want a way to understand the world, because it’s unpredictable and scary, and we want to feel like we have some control over it. We want a story with good guys and bad guys, and to know where we fit in. If skeptics don’t offer people a positive, alternative way to understand the world, whether it’s science, or humanism, or something else, we’re in a position of trying to take away things that make people feel secure, while offering nothing to satisfy those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skepticism as a movement is known to be predominately made up of middle-aged white males. Do you have any thoughts on how to encourage more women and other ethnicities to get involved in skepticism or how we as a group can reach a broader audience? Have you run into any problems being a woman in this male dominated arena?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two separate issues here, recruitment and retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there are a lot of things wrong with the world besides people believing in things that aren’t real, and people have to choose their battles. Plus, the worse things are for you, the less disposable time and income you have to spare. If you’re inclined to change the world, &lt;img src="http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/9886/sadie7small.jpg" alt="sadie 7" width="280" height="420"&gt;and your life has been shaped by discrimination that threatens your economic survival, you’re going to be more likely to spend your limited energy on ending racism, sexism, and poverty than on skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue is, what kind of experience do women and people of color have when they are attracted to skepticism and they visit our conferences, blogs, and local groups?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of lectures I’ve seen by men on skeptical topics are peppered with sexist references to women’s physical appearance—not just about enemies like Sylvia Browne, but in one case a disgusting insult about a great hero of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect men make comments like that because they want to connect with the audience. But what it says to women in the audience is that they don’t care about relating to us as human beings and scientific thinkers but judge us mainly on our ornamental value. It’s ironic that these comments are usually made by men who look like they couldn’t get a date if they paid for it. (Did that offend anyone? Yeah, ladies don’t like it either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not difficult to change. People should stop saying and writing things that unfairly alienate half their potential audience and have nothing to do with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that takes more work to change is the first point—that people don’t consider what we’re doing to be relevant to their lives. We could start changing that by choosing issues that overlap with other important concerns, and not just issues that mostly interest people who already consider themselves skeptics. Are there issue campaigns being waged by organizations of people of color that skeptics could join in to support from a skeptical or humanist point of view? Are there industries we could target that are using supernatural or pseudoscientific beliefs to make money at the expense of low-income people? We should think beyond our desire to have a more diverse movement and think about what skepticism has to offer the people we want to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think it is possible to win the JREF’s Million Dollar Challenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely. If someone has a psychic ability that works better than pure chance, and they can demonstrate it consistently, they should be able to meet the standards of the challenge.&lt;img src="http://img806.imageshack.us/img806/7127/sadie12small.jpg" alt="sadie 12" width="280" height="420"&gt; It’s possible, but incredibly unlikely, that someone has an ability like that. It’s probably more likely that someone would win the challenge by pure chance—the odds are astronomical, but it’s not impossible. Someone wins the lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, ALL the Skepchicks read your introduction on the JREF blog and we were all, &lt;em&gt;“SQUEEE! ZOMG! Did you see the new girl!?”&lt;/em&gt; In that interview you were asked to tell something about yourself that no one would ever guess. You said this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Folks in the labor movement seem to love starting big meetings with icebreakers. The best one is called “two truths and a lie,” where you have to guess which one isn’t true. Here are mine:&lt;br&gt;
1.            An anarchist once declared a hunger strike against me.&lt;br&gt;
2.            My father was a trade-show magician.&lt;br&gt;
3.            My wife and I own more guns than cats, but just barely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have a bet over here at Skepchick headquarters as to which question is the lie. I got $50 riding on this. Tell us, which one is not true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t give all my secrets away, but I can tell you the lie is only technically false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have worked doing campaigns for a number of progressive causes, such as LGBT, feminist and labor nonprofits. Do you think the aims of the skeptical movement overlap with progressive or leftist causes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are common issues, like consumer advocacy. We have powerful common enemies, like religious fundamentalism. At the same time, there are folks in the skeptical world who follow a form of economic fundamentalism that is just as harmful, &lt;img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/8938/sadie8small.jpg" alt="sadie crabtree" width="280" height="420"&gt;and isn’t compatible with the kind of movement that makes things better for ordinary people. So, is there enough overlap for our movements to work together? Not automatically, but I think skeptics are at our best and most persuasive when we’re speaking out in the public interest—because bad beliefs and fraudulent claims hurt people—and not just in the interest of a fetishized rationality. I support reason and the scientific method because I think they’re the best methods we have of understanding the world, and I want to understand the world so we can improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think coming out skeptic or atheist is similar to coming out gay? Can our movement learn from the past successes and failures of the LGBT movements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s similar. I can imagine circumstances in which it might feel similar in some ways, but the experiences and issues aren’t transferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of the whole accomodationist/confrontationalist/&lt;em&gt;‘Don’t Be A Dick’&lt;/em&gt; argument in skepticism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a false dichotomy. You don’t win people to your side by being “a dick,” and you don’t win anything when you’re a pushover. But we don’t need to pick a spot on the dick-pushover continuum—those are just two bad things we shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question for me isn’t whether we fight, it’s how we can be more effective, and what words and approaches will help us win, and get more people to join with us. Sometimes words that &lt;img src="http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/1889/sadie13small.jpg" alt="sadie crabtree" width="280" height="420"&gt;sound pleasant can be the most devastating, and I think describing language as accommodationist vs. confrontationalist doesn’t take that into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we should be is strategic, and follow some common principles for movement-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Be welcoming to people who may want to get involved. Make it easy to join. People should be able to test the waters without signing up for the whole package. It’s okay to disagree with people, but don’t try to banish them from the community for not being skeptical enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Bring people together with campaigns that are fun, demonstrate your values, win concrete change, and give people a sense of accomplishment. Get new people involved by inviting them to join in specific campaigns and actions that they’re likely to agree with, instead of only recruiting them to a community with a set of ideas they need to subscribe to in order to belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Don’t be divisive when it isn’t necessary. Make sure that you’re spending more time uniting skeptical people around what they agree on than you’re spending debating what you don’t agree on. If a group of people has come together to work on a campaign to inform the public about about homeopathy, and they’re excited and ready to do the work, they don’t have to all agree on religion, or anything else. Those debates should be optional and come after the work is done, rather than becoming something that pushes people out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group can have a well-defined point of view without taking positions on tangential issues that are needlessly divisive. Likewise, there are ways to be constructively provocative without being “a dick,” and we need to distinguish between the two. Around any contested issue, there are some people who are simply hostile and anti-social by nature and use the idea of being “provocative” as an excuse. But provocation as a tactic shouldn’t be defined by those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is one skeptical topic that you wish there was legitimate evidence for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free energy, because it could alleviate a lot of the world’s problems. Also, finding proof that aliens had visited Earth would be great because it would demonstrate technology capable of traveling those kind of distances. Above all, I wish karma was real, because some people really have it coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Sadie for taking the time to talk to us and for letting me chase her around Hollywood with a camera!

As you may recall, these are questions you all send in when you have something important you’d like the readers to discuss, or when you can tell that I’m totally out of good ideas. (Use the comments or contact page to suggest more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic comes from &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; reader, mrmisconception, who says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I like to turn off my skepticism and watch (read) something that is as credulous as can be. My current favorites in this vein are &lt;em&gt;Fringe&lt;/em&gt; and a BBC show called &lt;em&gt;Misfits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your skeptical “dirty little secrets”? What are your irrational guilty pleasures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community. Look for it to appear Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 3pm ET. And the New and Improved Ass Kicking Thursday Afternoon Afternoon Inquisition is something Sam made up. Look for it to appear when Sam is out of ideas, sick, or just too drunk to even blink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I might sound a little like &lt;a href="http://www.whitedovebooks.co.uk/poems/inspiration/inspiration_51.html"&gt;Polonius giving parting advice to his son Laertes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Hamlet.&lt;/em&gt; For some reason I’m a little embarrassed if I do. This very brief letter allows for only  generic suggestions, and such things can sound like trite platitudes or wise proverbs.  I suppose the difference between those is in the eye of the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;i hate my life because my parenst are making me beleive that this jesus guy is god&lt;br&gt;
WTF&lt;br&gt;
HELP ME&lt;br&gt;
Greg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Greg,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relax. Don’t worry, no one can “make” you believe anything. It’s too late for that. Your mind has already developed enough independence to think your own thoughts. Otherwise you wouldn’t have written your email. Your parents can make you do things that are about Jesus, such as attending church, going to Bible study, or saying prayers, but that’s all on the outside. That’s just stuff you have to do. Inside your mind, you’re free to think your own thoughts and believe what makes sense to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don’t hate your life. It really is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; life, and it’s something to love and cherish and to take good care of.  Fill it with healthy food, healthy exercise, healthy relationships, and most of all, healthy thoughts.  Fill it with all the knowledge that you can jam into your head. Knowledge is your key to life-long freedom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m assuming that you’re quite young, and probably still dependent on your parents for your welfare, so you might just have to go along with the outward stuff they want you to do. I cannot tell from your letter if you feel free to frankly tell them your opinion. Sometimes parents handle such things well, and sometimes they don’t. Maybe you can negotiate something with them, maybe not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think carefully about your words before you let them out, whether talking about your disbelief in gods or your friend’s new hairstyle. Words are very powerful. Too often we throw them around recklessly. Consider what will be your words’ effect on others and what will be the consequences for you.  Sometimes silence is the wisest thing to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even the religious stuff you’re forced to do, you can turn to your advantage. Be a secret anthropologist, studying the beliefs and practices of the people who surround you. Knowing how they think and react will be a big advantage as you grow into adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the part of your life that you can control is inside your mind. Slowly, as you grow up you’ll gain more freedom over the outside parts of your life, like what you do, where you go, and who you are with. But for every one of those new freedoms will come a responsibility to handle that freedom wisely, being careful to not be thoughtless, reckless, or harmful to yourself or others. Like heads and tails, freedom and responsibility always go together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Jesus was a god either. If he existed at all, he was a man who tried to change things, and he was murdered for it. He had some good things to say about being kind and loving, helping others, and keeping hate out of your heart. That’s good advice for &lt;em&gt;anybody,&lt;/em&gt; and you don’t need to believe in gods to put it into practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking that advice, don’t let your frustration grow into hate for your parents. They’re probably not trying to deliberately torment you; they’re probably just trying to do what they think will help you.  It’s natural for young people to have some conflicts with their parents as they grow into independent adults, but it doesn’t always have to be hateful.  Try to keep your love for them even when you’re mad at them. It might soothe your anger a little to consider that there are many, many young people who hate their lives because they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have parents who make them do stuff. They don’t have food, or beds, or clothes either.  Sometimes looking at a broader picture can give you a little more patience with your situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to disagree with them and not be constantly tense from annoyance and aggravation. Ask yourself, “Is this upset &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bigger than me? Aren’t I actually bigger than it?”  Some battles are worth fighting now, some are better if they’re postponed. The right time will be when you are in a position of strength and independence. And then sometimes when the time is finally right, it just isn’t that important any more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever your frustration or any other feeling is about to boil over, here’s a trick that will save you a great deal of regret and apologies: Quietly take three deep, slow breaths. Slowly inhale deeply, pause for just a second, and slowly exhale fully. Repeat three more as needed. There’s nothing like a powerful shot of oxygen to help you handle any situation, whether it’s painful boredom at a religious thing you have to do, or panic when you look at the first question on an important exam in school.  Oxygen is your friend. It soothes the emotions and clears the mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find other people close to your age who feel the same way. They’re out there. Just be discrete, and be sure they know how to keep your private information private. Stick around here and begin to comment on various posts, sharing a little of yourself at a time. You’ll find there are many people who definitely understand what you’re going through. You’re certainly not alone. Also, Google “teen atheist” and “young atheist,” and you’ll find a variety of resources for young people who are also your predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg, I have only guesses about your circumstances, so my advice is very general. Take what applies and discard what doesn’t.  Though you don’t believe that Jesus is God, you can believe in your own intrinsic worth, in your own basic goodness, and in your own ability to sort things out. Ask many other people, young and old, for advice on all sorts of things. You don’t ever have to accept all  or any of what they suggest. You can pick and choose. As you reach one crossroad after another, making choice after choice, you will be the judge; the final decisions and the responsibility will always be yours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

But in my direct experience amongst atheist bloggers and blogophiles?  ZOMG, the comments on the blogs I frequent are a joy to read compared to the tripe that infests most of teh interwubz.  It's not even just what is said, or the logic and critical thinking that is applied -- though that counts for something too.  It's that people seem to care a little bit about spelling and grammar, at least enough to try and make themselves understandable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What occasioned these remarks is that I happened to stumble upon &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/blues2/bonzo_montrevux/The_Great_Debate.htm"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; while I was Googling for something else.  Neither the Creationist nor the person debating him/her comport themselves particularly well.  They both come across like idiots.  I didn't read the whole thing, so I don't know if "99octane" eventually got around to anything of substance.  But "ViRuS"'s initial post is just hilarious.

It's a typical collection of squirrely non-sequiturs, but I'll address the funniest of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what PZ Myers of the Pharyngula blog fails to understand is that the CSHF does not intend to limit its honors to contemporary creation-oriented scientists. He probably believes that because he is under a common misapprehension: that creation science is a new movement, one going no further back than Henry Morris and John C. Whitcomb's The Genesis Flood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in all things, Terry Hurlbut is mistaken and ignorant. No, I do not fail to understand that; in fact, I expect that. It's one of creationism's most common strategems, the adoption of any scientist who lived before Darwin into the ranks of anti-Darwinists. I'm sure Isaac Newton will be inducted into the Creationist Hall of Fame, despite the fact that, brilliant as he was, he was not a biologist, did not consider the problems of biological origins at all deeply, did no work in the field, and didn't even have an evolutionary theory to argue against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationism is a belief born of ignorance. It depends on a lack of awareness of biological realities and knowledge of the experiments and observations in the discipline (or, alternatively, awareness of this work coupled to a malignant denial). Terry Hurlbut can go ahead and mine the human population a thousand generations back and find plenty of smart and accomplished human beings, and draft them posthumously to be part of his &amp;quot;creationist movement&amp;quot;, but it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that the chief criterion for membership in that movement is simply ignorance. Isaac Newton was ignorant of the facts of evolutionary biology, and so was Aristotle, and so was Thog, son of Thag, caveman. Go ahead, sign them all up, they&amp;#39;re as much an intellectual contributor to creationism as they are spiritual members of the Mormon church…but that won&amp;#39;t stop the Mormons from baptizing them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still incapable of reading for comprehension, Hurlbut horks up another error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final word is in order: the Creation Science Hall of Fame makes no representation that it will have as many inductees as the so-called "Science Hall of Fame" of which PZ Myers is so fond. In harping on the apparent scarcity of CSHF honorees thus far (and forgetting that the CSHF is under construction in cyberspace as well as under development in brick and mortar), Myers commits a classic logical fallacy: argumentum a numeris (argument from numbers), or argumentum a multitudine (argument from the crowd). Instead, the CSHF will compete on quality, not quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh. Right. If he read a little more closely, he might have noticed that what I thought worth noting was that the Science Hall of Fame uses an objective measurement of the recognition granted to the scientists in the literature. When those same measurements are made of their creationist heroes, they fail. The Creationist Hall of Fame is going to be populated by clowns who are selected for their adherence to the crazy notion that the Earth is 6000 years old, leavened by a small set of famous scientists who lived before the neo-Darwinian Synthesis. That isn't quality. That's lunacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I'm sure Hurlbut will rant some more, but I won't be replying. He gets paid for traffic to his Examiner site, and he probably simply sees this as an easy way to milk the cash cow, and I won't be helping him further.&lt;/p&gt;

The reasons for this sex difference are not completely clear, but probably relies on some different metabolic needs occurring during the reproduction. This is particularly evident in lay-egg animals like fishes and birds: to make egg nutrients, the liver is stimulated by the estrogen hormone to increase lipid and protein production (vitellogenesis). In mammals also (and humans, ditto) hormones like estrogen, and other nutrients (i.e., dietary lipids), can activate liver gene expression by binding to cognate &amp;#39;nuclear receptors&amp;#39; (NRs). In fact, nuclear receptors can modulate the transcriptional rates of genes involved in a broad range of metabolic response programs. Because i) liver gene expression is different between females and males, and ii) the liver metabolic landscape is sex dimorphic, one can argue NRs having some gender-dimorphic activities. However, in most studies only one sex is used (the male for some authors, the female for others), this introduces a bias in our knowledge and makes the sex differences pass unobserved.

Fat liver (steatosis or &amp;#39;foie gras&amp;#39;) is an hallmark of severe diseases including liver cancer. Derangements of nuclear receptor regulation affect lipid metabolism and contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases. This places nuclear receptors into the frontline for novel therapeutic approaches for a broad range of hepatic disorders. Detailing the extent of NR-mediated sex-dimorphic actions may be pivotal in preventive medicine and in the design of safer gender-specific therapeutic approaches.

Martin Wagner and colleagues, have recently reviewed the wide role of nuclear receptors in regulating liver metabolism. We complete this review with a second one focusing on the current knowledge of hepatic, sex-associated roles of individual NRs. We show that sexual dimorphism affects both the level of individual gene expression and the concerted activities of interconnected genes controlled by nuclear receptors. Finally, we discuss the hypothesis that this sex-dimorphic NR ‘interactome’ targets selected pathways in the liver, and deregulation of these pathways may favor the development of sex-biased diseases.

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Information is Beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/horoscoped/"&gt;made a word cloud for each astrological sign&lt;/a&gt; compiled from 22,000 “predictions” from Yahoo.  This is what they found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/infobeautiful2/horoscoped.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/infobeautiful2/horoscoped.png" width="550" height="467"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you know… the same words seem to pop up for each sign.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel.  Life.  Better.  Sure.  Keep.  Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique words to each astrological sign are in red — but they’re almost all throwaway words (e.g. “instead,” “totally,” “looking”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads to this meta-horoscope you can all use at anytime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ready? Sure? Whatever the situation or secret moment, enjoy everything a lot. Feel able to absolutely care. Expect nothing else. Keep making love. Family and friends matter. The world is life, fun, and energy. Maybe hard. Or easy. Taking exactly enough is best. Help and talk to others. Change your mind and a better mood comes along…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds just like me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to teach your gullible friend a lesson, cut out each wedge and have her pick the one that best describes her.  Odds are she’ll pick a sign different from her own.  And hilarity will ensue.&lt;/p&gt;

Along with big picture stuff, it includes a number of smaller scale items. Let me list a few that immediately caught my attention–for instance, the media and culture cuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporation for Public Broadcasting Subsidy. $445 million annual savings.&lt;br&gt;
National Endowment for the Arts. $167.5 million annual savings.&lt;br&gt;
National Endowment for the Humanities. $167.5 million annual savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the dirty energy cuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department of Energy Grants to States for Weatherization. $530 million annual savings.&lt;br&gt;
Applied Research at Department of Energy. $1.27 billion annual savings.&lt;br&gt;
Energy Star Program. $52 million annual savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the denial cuts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate taxpayer subsidies to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. $12.5 million annual savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the cuts that I probably support but that have no meaning whatsoever in the context of the massive deficit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate Mohair Subsidies. $1 million annual savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was a song it might be called “looking for money in all the wrong places.” Defunding the IPCC, and saving just $ 12.5 million, seems particularly wrongheaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year’s estimated budget deficit was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_federal_budget"&gt;$ 1.171 trillion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Elizabeth Lesser explores the two sides of human nature within us (call them "the mystic" and "the warrior") that can be harnessed to elevate the way we treat each other.

&lt;p&gt;This past August, hundreds of scientists, futurists, philosophers and others gathered to explore the impact of technology on our society at the 2010 Singularity Summit.

Their latest folly is to pretend that women have a series of evolved behaviors to avoid rape during the time that they're ovulating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jerry Coyne has already commented on the study and his follow-up posting is worth reading because it highlights the responses of others who have dissected the papers [&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/the-women-of-slate-take-on-evolutionary-psychology/"&gt;The women of Slate take on evolutionary psychology&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottom line is that the entire field of evolutionary psychology is in big trouble and it is bound to become a major laughing stock unless evolutionary psychologists clean up their act [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/06/evolutionary-psychology-as-maladapted.html"&gt;Evolutionary Psychology as Maladapted Psychology&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of Jerry Coyne&amp;#39;s comments caught my eye because we&amp;#39;ve just been reading the Gould &amp;amp; Lewontin &lt;i&gt;Spandrels&lt;/i&gt; paper in class. Coyne said,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Like the stories of the Bible, there’s no evolutionary psychology hypothesis that can be disconfirmed by data. If your story doesn’t hold up, simply concoct another story.  Of course, there’s no evidence for the alternative stories, either.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1979 Gould and Lewontin wrote,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The admission of alternatives in principle does not imply their serious consideration in daily practice. We all say that not everything is adaptive; yet, faced with an organism, we tend to break it into parts and tell adaptive stories as if trade-offs among competing, well designed parts were the only constraint upon perfection for each trait. It is an old habit. As Romanes complained about A.R. Wallace in 1900: "Mr. Wallace does not expressly maintain the abstract impossibility of laws and causes other than those of utility and natural selection... Nevertheless, as he nowhere recognizes any other law or cause... he practically concludes that, on inductive or empirical grounds, there is no such other law or cause to be entertained. The adaptationist programme can be traced through common styles of argument. We illustrate just a few; we trust they will be recognized by all:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) If one adaptive argument fails, try another. Zig-zag commissures of clams and brachiopods, once widely regarded as devices for strengthening the shell, become sieves for restricting particles above a given size (Rudwick, 1964). A suite of external structures (horns, antlers, tusks) once viewed as weapons against predators, become symbols of intra-specific competition among males (Davitashvili, 1961). The eskimo face, once depicted as "cold engineered" (Coon, et al., 1950), becomes an adaptation to generate and withstand large masticatory forces (Shea, 1977). We do not attack these newer interpretations; they may all be right. We do wonder, though, whether the failure of one adaptive explanation should always simply inspire a search for another of the same general form, rather than a consideration of alternatives to the proposition that each part is "for" some specific purpose.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Plus ça change, plus c&amp;#39;est la même chose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-629872808218579762?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295545968992"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=26895">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/227501617307233c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="book reviews"/><category term="philosophy"/><title type="html">Blackford reply to Harris’s reply</title><published>2011-01-20T17:52:33Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T17:52:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/blackford-reply-to-harriss-reply/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;em&gt;Metamagician&lt;/em&gt;, Brother Blackford has begun a reply to &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/harris-responds-to-blackford/"&gt;Sam Harris’s post&lt;/a&gt;, which itself was a response to &lt;a href="http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm"&gt;Blackford’s review of Harris’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm"&gt;The Moral Landscape&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secular Student Alliance is giving you the motivation you need to do that with our &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/2011carrotstick"&gt;Carrot and Stick project&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1) Make a measurable self-improvement goal (how much weight to lose, how many push-ups to do)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Decide an amount to pledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Choose an organization you would hate to give money to — this is your “stick”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Write out checks dated March 31st to both the Secular Student Alliance (this is your “carrot”) and the organization you chose in step 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reach your goal by March 31st, send the check to the SSA and rip up the check to your opposing organization. If not, you have to send the check to the ‘stick’ cause instead!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SSA’s Executive Director &lt;strong&gt;August Brunsman&lt;/strong&gt; used this method over the past few months and it worked wonderfully:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course I’ve tried dozens of times before to lose weight. By deciding to tie specific consequences to getting down to 175 lbs. by the end of the year, I was suddenly more motivated than ever before to make the hundreds of right choices, big and little, I needed to get there. After I made my pledge public, I knew I had only three choices: behave in such a way as to lose the weight (acceptable but hard), publicly admit that I was sending money to Campus Crusade for Christ (very painful), or lie (very, very painful).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/files/August_Ripping_Check.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.secularstudents.org/files/August_Ripping_Check.jpg" width="150" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jen McCreight&lt;/strong&gt;‘s &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2011/01/off-my-ass-for-ssa-beginning.html"&gt;doing this&lt;/a&gt;, too, and she’s already lost a few pounds in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to join in on the action after the Speech season ends at the end of February (I’m at school late most of the next month practicing with students and working out just isn’t on my radar when I get home).  But come March, you all have my permission to force me to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just over two months to reach your target goal, so &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/2011carrotstick"&gt;take advantage of the situation&lt;/a&gt;. By bettering yourself (however you want to define that), you’re also helping others in the process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a win-win opportunity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you lose.  (In which case I’m really curious where your check would go to.)  But please don’t let that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;br&gt;

Gosnell ran an abortion mill in Philadelphia, and was a hack who maimed and killed women while doing abortions on demand, for a substantial fee. He was unqualified, uncertified in obstetrics and gynecology, and his facility was unmonitored and relatively uninspected. He gave untrained, inexperienced staff critical jobs in the surgery — he allowed a 15 year old high school student to handle anesthesia. He killed a patient by overdosing her on drugs, and is also charged with killing 7 babies in late-term abortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosnell is precisely the kind of butcher the pro-choice movement opposes. &lt;i&gt;No one&lt;/i&gt; endorses bad medicine and unrestricted, unregulated, cowboy surgery like Gosnell practiced — what he represents is the kind of back-alley deadly hackery that the anti-choice movement would have as the only possible recourse, if they had their way. If anything, the Gosnell case is an argument &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; legal abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is entirely appropriate that this monster be shut down and charged with serious crimes against women. This isn't the first death for which he's responsible; another woman died of a perforated uterus, others suffered from punctured internal organs, others were left sterile by his botched work. The most shocking news is that this guy has been chopping up poor women since 1979, and that the last time the state actually inspected his facilities was in 1993. Why have people looked the other way and allowed this to continue for 30 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has also been charged with the murders of seven babies, and there I have to disagree. There has to be a difference in degree, or the mothers of those infants would also have to be charged as collaborators (they were all willing volunteers for this medical procedure, and they knew the result would be termination of their pregnancy). They haven't, and they shouldn't. Much noise is being made about the "horrific" killings, but late term abortions, even the ones done in clean, properly maintained facilities with well-trained personnel, are always necessarily bloody and unpleasant affairs, like most surgeries. The important word there is "necessary". Late term abortions should be carried out when it is essential for the life and health of the woman, who is the most important participant in these circumstances, and opening the door to  accusing doctors who perform necessary operations as murder is a dangerous precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosnell committed many crimes. He posed as a qualified practitioner of his art, when he wasn't. He did not maintain a medical facility in an appropriate manner. He had even less qualified people do life-threatening work. He lied to women about their pregnancies. He mutilated and killed women. He did harm. That should be what generates public outrage, not the fact that he did abortions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/this_is_not_a_case_about_abort.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_K8Hf5oI_OM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295536481218"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/?p=6075">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2fa2e08328927fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Climate Science"/><category term="Greenhouse gases"/><title type="html">Getting things right</title><published>2011-01-20T15:04:42Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T15:04:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/01/getting-things-right/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Monday, I was asked by a journalist whether a claim in a &lt;a href="http://www.hoffmanpr.com/world/ClimateChangeFoodGap/The%20Food%20Gap%20-%20The%20Impacts%20of%20Climate%20Change%20on%20Food%20Production%20by%202020.pdf"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from a small NGO made any sense. The report was mostly focused on the impacts of climate change on food production – clearly an important topic, and one where public awareness of the scale of the risk is low. However, the study was based on a mistaken estimate of how large global warming would be in 2020. I replied to the journalist (and indirectly to the NGO itself, as did other scientists) that no, this did not make any sense, and that they should fix the errors before the report went public on Thursday. For various reasons, the NGO made no changes to their report. The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/19/false-climate-change-study"&gt;press response&lt;/a&gt; to their study has therefore been almost totally dominated by the error at the beginning of the report, rather than the substance of their work on the impacts. This public relations debacle has lessons for NGOs, the press, and the public.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erroneous claim in the study was that the temperature anomaly in 2020 would be 2.4ºC above pre-industrial. This is obviously very different from the IPCC projections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.ipcc.ch/graphics/ar4-wg1/jpg/spm5.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which show trends of about 0.2ºC/decade, and temperatures at 2020 of around 1-1.4ºC above pre-industrial. The claim is thus at least 1ºC above what it should have been, and implied trends over the next decade an order of magnitude higher than otherwise expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How they made this mistake is quite instructive though. The steps they followed were as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Current CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 390 ppm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Growth in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is around 2 ppm/yr, and so by 2020 there will be ~410 ppm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far so good. The &lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelforce/ghgases/GCM_2004.html"&gt;different IPCC scenarios&lt;/a&gt; give a range of 412-420 ppm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They then calculated the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq to be 490 ppm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The forcing from 490 ppm with respect to the pre-industrial is 5.35*log(490/280)=3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Given a climate sensitivity of 3ºC for 2xCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e. 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a forcing of 3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; translates to 3*3/3.7=2.4ºC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first error is in misunderstanding what &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/10/co2-equivalents/"&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq&lt;/a&gt; means and is used for. Unfortunately, there are two mutually inconsistent definitions out there (and they have been &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/10/co2-equivalents/"&gt;confused before&lt;/a&gt;). The first, used by policymakers in relation to the Kyoto protocol, relates the radiative impact of all the well-mixed greenhouse gases (i.e. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CFCs) to an equivalent amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for purposes of accounting across the basket of gases. Current GHG amounts under this definition are ~460 ppm, and conceivably could be 490 ppm by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the other definition is used when describing the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; net forcing on the climate system. In that case, it is not just the Kyoto gases that must be included but also ozone, black carbon, sulphates, land use, nitrates etc. Coincidentally, all of the extra GHGs and aerosols actually cancel out to a large extent and so the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq in this sense is quite close to the actual value of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; all on its own (i.e. in IPCC 2007, the radiative forcing from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was 1.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the net radiative forcing was also 1.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (with larger uncertainties of course), implying the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq was equal to actual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In deciding how the climate is going to react, one obviously needs to be using the second definition. Using the first is equivalent to assuming that between now and 2020 all anthropogenic aerosols, ozone and land use changes will go to zero. So, they used an excessive forcing value (3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; instead of ~2 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second mistake &lt;del&gt;has a bigger consequence:&lt;/del&gt; is that they assumed that the instantaneous response to a forcing is the same as the long-term equilibrium response. This would be equivalent to a planet in which there was no thermal inertia – or one in which there were no oceans. Oceans have such a large heat capacity that it takes decades to hundreds of years for them to equilibriate to a new forcing. To quantify this, modellers often talk about transient climate sensitivity, a measure of a near term temperature response to an increasing amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and which is often less than half of the standard climate sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to be acknowledged that people sometimes make genuine mistakes without having any desire to mislead or confuse, and that this is most likely the case here. It does no responsible organisation any good to have such a mistake in their material. It just leads to distractions from the substance of the report. The situation is serious enough that there is no need for exaggerated claims to produce headlines, just the plain unvarnished best guesses will be fine. It is likely that temperatures will reach 2.4ºC at some point &lt;del&gt;in the next&lt;/del&gt; this century, and so the calculated impacts are certainly relevant – just not in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in this case the people involved did not decide to fix the errors that were pointed out, going so far as to have the PR person for the launch insist that the calculation was ok. That the Guardian journalist, Suzanne Goldenberg, took the time to check on the details is a credit to the press. The reaction can be put down to institutional inertia, combined with the fact that their scientific advisor was in hospital (and is 87). It would clearly have been much better to have had this properly peer reviewed ahead of time. To that end the &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aguclimateqaservice/"&gt;AGU Q&amp;amp;A climate service&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.climaterapidresponse.org/"&gt;Climate Science Rapid Reaction Taskforce&lt;/a&gt; (CSRRT) are invaluable resources for getting some quick scientific peer review.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295536243317"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Significant-Figures/~3/3nko1Vuj7y4/lgs-lucky-break-and-rebooting-your-brand.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4d4d3c7800dcd5b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">LG’s lucky break and rebooting your brand</title><published>2011-01-20T07:00:42Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T07:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/gerZJ-mB-YQ/lgs-lucky-break-and-rebooting-your-brand.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Significant-Figures/~3/3nko1Vuj7y4/lgs-lucky-break-and-rebooting-your-brand.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">LG is a strong brand.

Marine conservationists have proposed a variety of [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Even though milk allergies in infants and very young toddlers are the most common food allergy, they still occur in only about 2.5 percent of the population in the US and other Western groups.  For this reason, I was rather perplexed some months back when I encountered a group of eight mothers randomly assembled, three of whom had infants with milk allergies.  Two of the mothers had started to eliminate all dairy from their diets, including eggs, in order to reduce the effects of the milk allergy on their infants.  Who were breastfeeding.

No surprise that blocking EPA rules on climate change is the top priority, but there are some other things that I find striking: A federal renewable energy standard will be resisted (this surely can’t help us &lt;a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2011-01-19-cant-beat-china-cleantech-gop-kissing-fossil-fuel-ass"&gt;compete with China&lt;/a&gt;) and there will be attempts to block regulation of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/12/02/the-science-of-fracking/"&gt;fracking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only place where there’s much room for compromise is nuclear–the GOP wants to make it easier to permit new plants and to continue to develop Yucca Mountain as the national waste repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, it’s getting harder and harder to oppose the former if you’re concerned about climate change. And as for Yucca–this issue has been nightmarishly mismanaged going back decades (leading to strong local resistance), but we’ve also spent billions to develop a repository there. At the very least, it’s a complicated, murky subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe Democrats can trade nuclear for a renewables standard? It’s clear we won’t get anything fundamental done on climate change, but both would help address the problem indirectly by promoting cleaner energy–a small win-win, maybe, in the context of political gridlock that will be mostly lose-lose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295534849070"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4479470612609451101">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa213bbd63fa4d37</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Dispatches: Return to Africa&amp;#39;s Witch Children</title><published>2011-01-20T14:36:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T14:44:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/g5nFjqekENM/dispatches-return-to-africas-witch.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/4479470612609451101/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=4479470612609451101" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2011/01/dispatches-return-to-africas-witch.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;My heart breaks when I consider the harm Christianity does to children accused of witchcraft in Africa.

&lt;p&gt;As you recall, Bering highlighted a number of “scientific” studies purporting to show that women have a genetic “rape kit”: an evolved set of behavioral modules that act &lt;em&gt;only during ovulation&lt;/em&gt; to reduce the possibility of rape.  These behaviors include increased grip strength, avoidance of places where they’re likely to be assaulted, and increased racism (the latter is supposed to be an adaptation to avoid being raped by a member of an “outgroup”).  I questioned these results because they were based on single studies using using a small sample size of undergraduates at single American colleges.  Further, the authors neglected potential weaknesses of the work—or alternative, non-evolutionary interpretations.  (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/the_evolution_of_rape.php"&gt;P. Z. also leveled these criticisms &lt;/a&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of evolutionary psychologists went after me in the comments, claiming that I was tarring the field by criticizing some articles that were, after all, in the popular press.  What these critics don’t seem to realize is that many evolutionary-psychology papers themselves—papers from the primary scientific literature—are also lame, dubious, or even laughable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what two of the &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; columnists found. They simply read the original papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post at&lt;em&gt; Slate’s XX Factor&lt;/em&gt;, “&lt;a href="http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/ovulating-woman-seeks-better-science"&gt;Ovulating woman seeks better science&lt;/a&gt;,” Amanda Schaffer dissected the paper by Navarrete et al. (reference and link below) that purports to show that women become more racist during ovulation. I’ve now read it as well.  Schaffer points out that the authors (and Bering, who reports their results) neglect two results that go against the authors’ own hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the single, unreplicated &lt;a href="http://www.dianafleischman.com/navarreteracebias.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; he [Bering] cites, researchers gave women several tests of racial prejudice and  tried to correlate the results with their menstrual cycles. On a few  measures of implicit or unconscious racial bias, they found that women  who were more likely to be ovulating tended to score higher. On a  measure of explicit or conscious racial bias, however, they found no  link between ovulation and prejudice. Now, we could delve into the  minutiae of those tests and argue about whether implicit or explicit  attitudes about race matter most. But Bering doesn’t do that. He simply  ignores the negative finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, he sure does, and so do the authors of the study.  They—and Bering—also neglect the observation that there is no correlation between ovulation and fear of rape, something that should certainly be seen if racism is a result of that fear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, that same study complicates his argument in another,  unacknowledged way. The researchers measured women’s feelings of  “vulnerability to sexual coercion” using something called the “fear of  rape scale.” And they reported that women who are both more likely to be  ovulating and more afraid of sexual coercion were more likely to show  racial bias. But here’s the confusing part: they also looked at the more  basic question of whether ovulating women were, in fact, more likely to  fear rape or take measures to avoid it in the first place – and they  found no connection. That would seem to be a problem for Bering. Higher  up in his piece, after all, he argues that “ovulating women overestimate  strange males’ probability of being rapists.” He cites a study that  claims: “&lt;em&gt;women perceive men as more sexually coercive at fertile points of their cycle than at non-fertile points&lt;/em&gt;.”  This is supposed to help prove that rape-avoidance around ovulation is  an evolved adaptation. Yet when another study in his grab bag turns up  negative evidence, as in no link between fertility and fear of rape, he  never mentions it. The study authors don’t highlight it either—it’s  tucked in a data table. And they all go blithely on their story-telling  way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need a layperson to tell the authors this? Why didn’t the reviewers catch it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s typical of many evo-psychology studies that they simply ignore, or downplay, results that don’t support the authors’ &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; Darwinian hypothesis.  Indeed, in many ways evolutionary psychology resembles religious belief—at least in the fervor of many of its advocates and their tendency to completely ignore data that don’t support their hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tendency is highlighted by another &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; piece, one by the ever-thoughtful (and entertaining) Emily Yoffe, “&lt;a href="http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/not-time-month-again"&gt;Not that time of the month again&lt;/a&gt;.”  Yoffee goes after a different paper: one by Meghan Provost et al. (citation and link below) that studied changes in women’s walking gait during their menstrual cycle.  As author Provost reported in &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7082704.stm"&gt;an interview with BBC news&lt;/a&gt;, the authors expected to find that women would walk in a “sexier” manner during ovulation, adopting the salacious hip-swinging gait made famous by Marilyn Monroe.  This prediction stemmed from previous evo-psychology studies showing that women become more attractive during ovulation, presumably to attract a mate when they’re most fertile. (These earlier studies claimed to show that men found women’s faces more attactive during ovulation than at other times; the same held for the smell of vaginal secretions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what Provost et al. found was the exact opposite of their prediction.  Women walked in an “unsexier” way during ovulation, swinging their hips less and keeping their knees closer together.  And when men were asked to judge the attractiveness of women’s walks at different stages of their cycle, they found them sexier when women &lt;em&gt;weren’t ovulating&lt;/em&gt;!  So the author’s thesis was disproved. Did that show that variations in walk during the menstrual cycle had nothing to do with ovulation? Nope, the authors simply told another story.  As Yoffe notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having their thesis disproved was no obstacle for the researchers.  They  just came up with an equally spurious thesis: Evolution made women want  to look “unsexy” during ovulation to discourage nonpartners from raping  them. Actually what the study proves is that there is no finding that  won’t prove something about women and ovulation. However, I have the  feeling when, say, Mongol horsemen galloped into a village they weren’t  calculating, “Hmmm, that one, not so much hip swing, not going to bother  to rape her!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually worse than this.  The authors have to reconcile their finding that women’s walks are less attractive when they’re ovulating with the earlier findings that female faces and vaginal secretions are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; attractive when they’re ovulating.   Provost et al.’s theory—wait for it—is that women give different signals to men at different distances.  Here’s what the authors say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that faces and gait present different information because of the intimacy with which the stimulus is viewed. For example, faces can only be seen in a fairly close encounter, whereas gait patterns can be seen from a large distance. If women are trying to protect themselves from sexual assault at times of peak fertility, it would make sense for them to advertise attractiveness on a broad scale when they are not fertile, yet still being attractive to people they choose to be with (i.e., during face-to-face interactions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the stories of the Bible, there’s no evolutionary psychology hypothesis that can be disconfirmed by data. If your story doesn’t hold up, simply concoct another story.  Of course, there’s no evidence for the alternative stories, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; post called “&lt;a href="http://www.doublex.com/blog/xxfactor/rape-likely-not-genetic-adaptation"&gt;Rape likely not genetic adapation,&lt;/a&gt;” Amanda Marcotte is less successful in her criticisms.  Although she mentions the posts by both P.Z. and me, she also goes off the mark a bit.  For example, she says this about Bering’s article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also the weird side assumption that features prominently in many  half-baked evolutionary theories, which is that sex is strictly about  reproduction in a species that has homosexuality, contraception, and old  people who get it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on a misunderstanding of evolutionary psychology.  Evolution has given us orgasms as a &lt;em&gt;proximate&lt;/em&gt; cue to reproduce: orgasms almost certainly evolved to make us want to copulate, since they provide profound pleasure associated with the act of copulation.  But using our evolved brain, we can experience that pleasure without reproducing (other animals can do this too, as you may know from visiting the zoo!) “Getting it on” as a gay, a lone masturbater, or an old person, simply takes advantage of the orgasm cue in a way that dissociates it from its evolved “purpose.”  The same thing happens when we eat too much fat or sugar—we’re using cues that were adaptive in our ancestors (our taste for rare but nutritious substances) in a way that doesn’t further our reproductive output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcotte also accuses Bering of being soft on rape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with his disavowals, the fact remains that Bering’s article  downplays the severity of rape.  It suggests that there’s not much to be  done about rape and that men are just programmed to do it, and it  distracts from the fact that it’s a violent act, experienced by both  victim and assailant as assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this accusation is unfair, since Bering does go to great pains to say that he recognizes the severity of rape, and certainly does not say there’s nothing to be done about it. And yes, rape is a violent act, but it’s also a sexual act. Granted, some rapists use condoms, or engage in non-vaginal penetration, but there is still a sexual side to the act: the attainment of orgasm.  And orgasms were our evolved cue to reproduce.  My own theory is that rapists tend to be men with violent tendencies who use violence to both dominate women and have sex.  But that’s just a hypothesis, and I certainly do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; think that rape is an evolved behavioral module in males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the fact that two laypeople can read papers in evolutionary psychology, and find obvious problems with them, shows that it’s not just the popular press that distorts the scientific findings. It’s the authors of the papers themselves who are lax, as behavioral biologist &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/evolutionary-psychology-for-the-masses/#comment-71686"&gt;Marlene Zuk has pointed out in her comments on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain my claim that much of evolutionary psychology is scientifically weak: little more than exercises in story-telling with a thin veneer of science.  I emphasize again that not every study in the field is weak or flawed: there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some good work in evolutionary psychology.  But the field suffers in general from not only scientific lassitude, but a failure of its practitioners to police the discipline.  Many of them have an interest in selling the field (which, of course, enhances their careers), and you can’t do that if you spend your time criticizing shoddy work by your colleagues.  It’s this failure of policing that leads me—and Yoffe and Schaffer—to put on our badges and nightsticks. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two of the mothers had started to eliminate all dairy from their diets, including eggs, in order to reduce the effects of the milk allergy on their infants.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;weird&lt;/span&gt; impressive thing about this is (as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh#Deafness"&gt;Wikipedia explains&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Rush Limbaugh has described himself as being "100%, totally deaf".[&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh#cite_note-RushLimbaugh.com-46"&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;] In 2001, he was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), which, in the span of three months, rendered his right ear completely deaf and left ear severely deaf. "I cannot hear television. I cannot hear music. I am, for all practical purposes, deaf – and it's happened in three months."[&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh#cite_note-138"&gt;139&lt;/a&gt;] On December 19, 2001, doctors at the House Ear Clinic in Los Angeles were able to successfully restore a measure of his hearing through a surgical procedure known as a cochlear implant surgery. Limbaugh received a Clarion CII Bionic Ear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — According to James Fallows, President Obama was as surprised by the consecutive-interpretation arrangement as Rush Limbaugh was (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/01/language-screwup-at-the-hu-obama-presser-maybe-not/69802/"&gt;Language Screwup at the Hu-Obama Presser? Maybe Not&lt;/a&gt;", 1/19/2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should also note that Mr. Limbaugh's concern about the accuracy of the translation is clearly just a fake premise for some jokey ching-chonging, since a recording of the press conference is &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2011/01/19/president-obama-and-president-hu-press-conference"&gt;easy to find at whitehouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;,  and he could easily enough have one of his assistants get someone he trusts to check the translation. Significant differences between what Hu said and how his official translator rendered his remarks would be a big story, but it's clear that Limbaugh's suspicions are not serious enough for him to instruct a minion to check.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2 — A comparison of Hu with Limbaugh. Here&amp;#39;s Hu&amp;#39;s answer to a reporter&amp;#39;s question (from 27:27 to 31:20 in the whitehouse.gov .mp3 and mp4 files):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s Rush Limbaugh&amp;#39;s imitation, from the first clip embedded above — I think he&amp;#39;s actually referring to exactly the cited answer from Hu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say that I give El Rushbo very high marks for vocal impressions, at least in this case — in fact, his performance seems closer to the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2605"&gt;ranting toddler video&lt;/a&gt; that went viral a few months ago.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #3 — James Fallows discusses some actual translation errors at the new conference (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/01/state-dinner-and-the-language-screwup-that-was-or-wasnt/69938/"&gt;State Dinner, and the 'Language Screwup' That Was, or Wasn't&lt;/a&gt;", 1/20/2010).]&lt;/p&gt;

After &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/but_i_dont_think_i_want_to_be.php"&gt;openly announcing his sectarian bias in a MLK Day speech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/01/19/2596096/alabama-governor-apologizes-for.html"&gt;Bentley has offered a not-pology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone from other religions felt disenfranchised by the language, I want to say I am sorry. I am sorry if I offended anyone in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jebus, but I hate that poor excuse for an apology. It happens all the time; someone says something stupid and wrong, and instead of saying, &amp;quot;I was wrong, I&amp;#39;m sorry and will try to change,&amp;quot; they say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry you were offended by my remarks&amp;quot; — suddenly, the problem lies not in the error of the speaker but in the sensitivity of the listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not an apology. It's a transparent attempt to twist the blame to fall on everyone else but the person who made the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even that's too generous: this wasn't a mistake. Bentley was honestly and intentionally expressing his views, as he has said, "speaking as an evangelical Christian to fellow Baptists." The man sincerely believes that his fellow superstitious louts are his special brothers and sisters who he has been elected to serve, and the riff-raff who don't go to his church are of lesser consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's what he needed to apologize for, and correct. He doesn't need to apologize for people finding offense in his stupidity and bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He especially doesn't need to apologize for that because pandering to a smug majority is what got him elected in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/governor_of_alabama_apologizes.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/l0uSaMJL17E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295530676324"><id gr:original-id="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2741">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3662043a4279c8f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Electrovestibulography"/><title type="html">Electrovestibulography</title><published>2011-01-20T13:28:20Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T13:28:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2741" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently received this question in my Topics Suggestions page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Novella,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting and rather weird neurological diagnostic technique…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/newinventors/txt/s2909625.htm"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/tv/newinventors/txt/s2909625.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be interested in hearing your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dave, Melbourne Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for bringing this to my attention, Dave. Electrovestibulography, or EVestG, is a technique that measures and digitally analyzes the electrical signals produced by the vestibular system during certain manipulations, such as changes in head position. The vestibular system is that part of the brain and inner ear that senses the orientation of the head with respect to gravity, and also acceleration. The primary sensory organ is three semicircular canals, each oriented along a different three-dimensional axis. These canals are filled with fluid (endolymph) and are lined with neurons that project tiny hairs into the canals. When the fluid moves in response to head rotation they flow past the hairs, bending them and triggering neuronal activation. Separate structures, the otolithic organs, respond to gravity or linear acceleration. This information is processed by the brain to give us the subjective sense of our own position with respect to gravity and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There already are standard tests for investigating vestibular function and localizing any dysfunction. Vestibular dysfunction usually results in vertigo – a subjective sense that either one is moving or the world is moving or spinning. (The colloquial term “dizzy” is often used to describe this sensation, but “dizzy” is a vague word with multiple meanings, so “vertigo” is the preferred technical term.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these inventors appear to have done is devise a system that measures the electrical output of the vestibular system during tilting or other maneuvers and then analyzes that output in order to search for patterns of activity. I have not found the technical information online to know if this basic part of the claim is true or not, but it is plausible. Let’s assume that their machine does what they claim it does – measure and analyze the electrical activity  of the vestibular system.   This remains to be determined, but there is nothing surprising about this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is – what are the clinical applications of this new diagnostic technology. The obvious application will be for diagnosing vestibular problems. This application is reasonably plausible, but cannot be taken for granted. Looking for patterns of electrical activity that act as a reliable marker for specific vestibular dysfunction is not easy, and requires a great deal of clinical study. We would need to know what the sensitivity and specificity of the test is in a variety of vestibular conditions, and then see if the test has validity – meaning that is predicts something. Do the results of the test correlate in any way with prognosis or response to specific treatments? Do they correlate with any gold standard tests already in use, or with any pathology that can be demonstrated in other ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a PubMed search on “Electrovestibulography” and came up with 6 papers. All six appear to be by the same team of researchers – the developers of the technology, which is a bit of a red flag. It could just mean that the technology is new and has not yet garnered attention from other researchers, and therefore there has not yet been any replication. This is fine – but means that we need to be very cautious about the claims until such replication can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the six papers, three deal with vestibular disease, two in animals and one claiming that their technique can distinguish between Meniere’s disease and benign positional vertigo – two different vestibular diseases. Sorry -&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18002472"&gt; I only have access to the abstract at the moment&lt;/a&gt;, which states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Separation of Meniere’s disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has been accomplished using a “DC” biomarker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract does not give any details as to the type of study that was done, but the absence of any details is concerning – no methods, no results, just a claim. It seems like an introductory paper just outlining the technology, and not the presentation of a detailed study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were the end of the story I would say that this is a new and interesting technology that requires some investigation and replication to determine if it works as claimed, and to see if it really does detect biomarkers of specific vestibular conditions. So far I am not impressed with the data being presented, and I would be concerned that the developers are going the commercial rather than the academic route. But I would keep an open mind until actual detailed studies are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. The developers of this technology then go on, from the most preliminary of data, to expand the potential clinical uses of their technology to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder with suggestions that it may also work for Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. This would mean that there are discernible vestibular biomarkers not only for vestibular diseases, but a host of distinct and very different neurological disorders. Plausibility has now plummeted and the red flags are flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19163624"&gt;In one study of schizophrenia &lt;/a&gt;they look at 4 affected subjects and 10 controls, without any apparent blinding. This sample size is too small to be of any real use, and is questionable if it should even be published – especially given that their outcome is not something concrete (like death or survival) but is the very complex action of pattern recognition – distinguishing different patterns of activity between schizophrenics and normal controls. This type of analysis would require many more subjects (50 or more sounds about right) and blinded analysis before I would take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that before the developers of this technology have done extensive research to validate its use for the most obvious application – vestibular dysfunction – they have done pilot studies for depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease. So now we have a small group of almost worthless pilot studies, rather than a series of increasingly tight and powerful studies for the most likely application. This is an odd way to proceed – unless one is trying to bolster the commercial appeal of a proprietary device by generating lots of low grade evidence for a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further – the evidence they have provided so far is akin to retrodicting – taking known quantities then looking for patterns. Astrologers can do this quite well – use astrology to “explain” why something happened in the past. But the real test of any system is its predictive power, and we have no data on that so far. The developers may be falling victim to simple pattern recognition and confirmation bias. They appear to be so impressed with the technical aspects of their device that they are neglecting the medical aspects – the plausibility of their claims and the type of data that would be needed to really substantiate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict that electrovestibulography will become just another fringe crank device with overblown and dubious claims. It seems to be heading rapidly in that direction. It may also have some genuine utility, but that is yet to be determined by proper studies. I would recommend to the developers that they focus on vestibular disease and perform (in collaboration with outside experts) large and well-designed studies to determine if it has true utility for such applications. Demonstrate first that the thing works and is useful. Then you can explore the more unlikely claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dungeon Crawl as Subway Punk-Gang Standoff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows what a dungeon game is. There's this underground complex of rooms and corridors, stocked with traps and secret doors, treasures and meanies to guard them. And you are a member (or all of the members) of a Tolkienesque band of vagabonds who descend into the underground, torch in one hand and sword in the other, in search of their fortune. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/472/dungeonquest"&gt;DungeonQuest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17226/descent-journeys-in-the-dark"&gt;Descent&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4491/cave-troll"&gt;Cave Troll&lt;/a&gt; is not that kind of game. Sure, the board depicts an underground complex full of treasure, and you do play a band of adventurers. But there are several competing parties of them, and each has more members than there are meanies in the dungeon. That dungeon is like the subway at rush time. And most of the time the adventurers don't fight the meanies, they threaten &lt;em&gt;each other&lt;/em&gt; over the piles of gold strewn here and there. Every once in a while, someone blows a whistle, and the punks divvy up the loot according to who has more or tougher people in a given room. Treasure, for some reason, cannot be moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's actually an area control game of a kind harking back all the way to &lt;a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181/risk"&gt;Risk&lt;/a&gt;, though little fighting is involved. Each player has his own stack of upside-down cardboard chits, like a deck of cards, only since they're chits they fit in the dungeon's rooms. Every turn you can reveal new chits and put them on the board, or move around the chits you've already put down, or use a magic item if you have previously been lucky enough to draw the chit that provides you with one of those. And you do your best to take possession of the rooms with the largest piles of treasure, waiting for someone to flip his "divvy-the-treasure time" chit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a couple of pet meanies in your chit stack as well, and you can send them after other players, but at my place we've found that it's usually not worth your time to harass the other players. Better to put more of your punks on the board instead. Time runs out once someone flips his last chit, and one successful strategy is actually to flip yours as fast as possible just to prevent other players from using theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your party consists mainly of vanilla punks. But then there's the knight, who is held in such awe in this feudal society that nobody of lower rank dares enter a room where he's hanging out, and the thief, who is busty and long-eared and can teleport for some reason, and the barber (errr, we call the barbarian the barber, OK?) who is big and scary. But the funniest party member is the dwarf. He's really good at finding extra gold in those rooms. But he doesn't give a damn about who wins the game: he happily hands over his loot to whoever is around. Stupid little punk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the meanies, there's the eponymous cave troll who is basically a nuke you drop on an offending room, the orc who kills punks and the wraith who scares them off. The latter two appear out of something that looks a lot like the dungeon's central cesspit, which may explain their grumpy manner. But as I said, at my place the orcs and wraiths rarely get to leave the pit, poor things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I quite like Cave Troll, giving it an 8 out of 10. It's a good, simple, short game that offers interesting strategic decisions and little down-time. The artwork is nice to look at. It works well with 6-7-y-o kids, as the only reading you have to do is the brief manual for your magic item. And it travels extremely well: the game is light-weight and easy to pack, fitting into the volume of a trade paperback book if you leave the box at home and put the chits in baggie. The board collapses into four book-size puzzle pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have the 2002 Fantasy Flight edition of Cave Troll with multi-lingual rules. It was my first thrift-store game. Game thrifting, rescuing good games from the cold and uncaring hands of non-gamers in thrift stores, is almost a hobby in itself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2011/01/game_review_cave_troll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/2IJJ4ivo2NQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295529388200"><id gr:original-id="http://blog.joerg.heber.name/2011/01/20/measuring-fields-in-the-tiniest-spots/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a33b45d1b6c2a86</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Measuring fields in the tiniest spots</title><published>2011-01-20T07:25:01Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T07:25:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/yNwb_Q00aaE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.joerg.heber.name/2011/01/20/measuring-fields-in-the-tiniest-spots/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">How do you measure a field like electrical or magnetic fields?

It's not that I didn't think the third part of Brian Deer's expose of Andrew Wakefield's fraud worthy of my attention. Rather, the Oz thing really got me peeved, peeved enough to push aside (temporarily, at least) Brian Deer's deconstruction of how the editors of &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; scrambled to cover their proverbial asses, which they proceeded to do with alacrity, as the title of Deer's article implies: &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;'s two days to bury bad news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been critical of &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; before for publishing Andrew Wakefield's case series. Indeed, to this day, I hadn't been able to figure out how Richard Horton, the editor of &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, kept his job in the wake of l'&lt;em&gt;affaire&lt;/em&gt; Wakefield, particularly after Wakefield's massive conflicts of interest had been revealed in 2004, as well as the possibility that Wakefield had subjected vulnerable children to invasive procedures that were not medically indicated. The reason is not so much that I would expect peer review to have uncovered what we now know to have been blatant fraud. Peer review has a hard time doing that because the default assumption in science tends to be one of honesty, namely that what authors report in manuscripts submitted to journals does not represent falsified data. Oh, sure, editors and reviewers are fully aware that scientists will try to present their data in such a manner to put the best possible spin on their experiments, to make their story as persuasive as possible. That's expected. What is not expected is outright dishonesty, falsification of data, the offense by Wakefield for which Deer presented strong evidence in his previous two articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, what should have gotten Horton fired, from my perspective, is that he accepted such a poor manuscript. Even taken at face value and even if there had been no scientific fraud, Wakefield's manuscript, a case series of only 12 children that, even viewed in as favorable a light as possible, didn't support the hypothesis that MMR vaccination was somehow associated with a new syndrome consisting of regressive autism and enterocolitis. It was the thinnest of thin gruel, which, again, even if viewed in the best possible light, didn't belong in the pages of &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe in the pages of some bottom-feeding medical journal or another, but not in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;. This is particularly true given the explosive nature of the implications of Wakefield's paper, which should have resulted in more caution on the editors' part to make sure that all the i's were dotted and t's crossed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/british_science_accused_in_the_wake_of_t.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/british_science_accused_in_the_wake_of_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/gspujwB3vjU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295528325604"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9955">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cd85a627103fad38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Herbs &amp; Supplements"/><category term="Pharmaceuticals"/><category term="adverse events"/><category term="CAM"/><category term="drug safety"/><category term="DSHEA"/><category term="Natural Health Products Directorate"/><category term="supplements"/><title type="html">The risks of CAM: How much do we know?</title><published>2011-01-20T12:45:01Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T12:45:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9955" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Working in pharmacies where supplements are sold alongside traditional (over-the-counter) medications, I’m regularly astonished at the different perceptions consumers can have about the relative efficacy and safety of different types of products. Once, speaking with a customer about a medical condition she wanted to treat, I indicated that there were no effective non-prescription therapies — she needed to see a physician for access to an effective treatment by prescription — and I gestured behind the counter. “Back there?!” she pointed. “That’s where you keep the stuff that kills people! I want something natural!” Suggesting that my patients with heart disease or HIV had a somewhat different perspective, I tried (unsuccessfully) to talk her out of a questionable-looking supplement (Hint: avoid anything from a company with a P.O. box as a mailing address.) This appeal to nature, combined with a perception that natural products are safe, and conventional drugs are unsafe, is pervasive.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the responses regularly tossed at health professionals who argue for higher regulatory standards for supplements, CAM, and other natural health products is that conventional medicine kills, and prescription drugs are its preferred weapon. In contrast, they argue, supplements are safe. Any credible health professional will agree that conventional medicine can cause harms. David Gorski has examined &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8540"&gt;SBM and patient safety before&lt;/a&gt;. The number of preventable adverse events from medical treatments is far too high. And even the idiosyncratic events — freak accidents, basically — mean we must always consider the rare but possible harms of the therapies we use. But as Harriet Hall &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=136"&gt;has pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, we cannot look at drug harms in isolation: the variable perpetually ignored by critics of mainstream medicine is the &lt;em&gt;benefits&lt;/em&gt; associated with those drugs, which can make the risks seem quite acceptable.  Both expected benefits and possible harms need to be incorporated into our decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to drug (or supplement) safety monitoring, causality assessment is the evaluation of the odds that a particular treatment is associated with a particular adverse event. A single adverse event may have characteristics that suggest the relationship to a treatment is highly probable. But because correlation may well &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equal causation, data are usually rolled up an analyzed in aggregate, by &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.who-umc.org/DynPage.aspx?id=13140"&gt;world-wide&lt;/a&gt; agencies to help identify the rare but serious adverse events. What this means is, if data are not collected, we have an incomplete picture of a product’s adverse event profile. Yet when it comes to supplements, good data on safety and efficacy are often lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;How Safe is the ‘Alternative’?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the recurrent themes of science-based medicine is that any medical intervention that can plausibly cause physiological benefit can also plausibly cause physiological harm.&lt;br&gt; — Steven Novella, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8174"&gt;Vitamin E and Stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the widespread perception that supplements are safe, some do have undesirable biological and pharmacological activity. There is no inherent safety to any product, natural or not. There is both anecdotal and more systematically-captured information to suggest harms can be associated with supplements. So how do we gather good data to inform decision making?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge we face when evaluating the risk profile of supplements is the lack of good quality clinical trial evidence. When these data do exist, studies are typically of short duration with small sample sizes. Without clinical trials that systematically measure and report adverse events, there’s no harms profile, and the “Side Effects” section of the monograph stays nice and short. In contrast to supplements, new drugs undergo extensive clinical trials and adverse events are actively monitored, collated, and eventually are summarized in the product monograph. It should surprise no-one that the list of adverse events is longer, when you actually go out an systematically look for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regulators worldwide generally don’t require any meaningful pre-sale testing of supplements for safety or efficacy, there’s typically little data available when any product becomes marketed. (Some regulators will approved products based on a history of “traditional use”, which offers little insight into a products safety profile, as that data have never been systematically collected.) Instead, regulators worldwide (e.g., Canada and the USA) rely almost entirely passive surveillance to monitor the safety of marketed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive surveillance depends on the spontaneous reporting of adverse events from health professionals, alternative medicine purveyors, manufacturers, and even consumers directly. Passive surveillance is the key method of collecting safety data on drugs and supplements once they have been licensed for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, passive surveillance is an imperfect means of collecting safety data. It is much more effective at identifying rare and infrequent adverse events (e.g., liver toxicity) than incremental increases in the risks of common medical conditions (e.g., heart attacks). While the true denominator cannot be know with certainty, it’s generally accepted that only a fraction of adverse events are identified, and only a fraction of these are actually reported.  Despite these limitations, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=136"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that in 2009, the FDA received 19,551 reports of patient deaths associated with drug therapy.  Is this the smoking gun that Big Pharma is killing us? Not quite. Causation has not been established, and even then, we need to consider harms in the context of the benefits a therapy may offer. The system isn’t perfect, but it is producing data that may be helpful for decision making, and understanding the evolving risk profile of licensed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their widespread use, surveillance of supplements reveals generally few adverse events. It could be that many products lack meaningful pharmacologic activity — either positive or negative. An adverse event is probably less likely in drugs without any meaningful beneficial effects. But beyond efficacy, there are several other factors, unique to supplement use, that may contribute to even less frequent adverse event reporting. These were identified in a series of qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted by Rishma Walji in 2010, and summarized in the paper &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/10/8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumers of Natural Health Products: natural born pharmacovigilantes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers believe supplements are safe, because they are “natural.” Therefore they’re less likely to associate adverse events with supplement use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplements don’t require a prescription. No health professional may be involved in monitoring response to therapy, who might be able to identify adverse events as part of a monitoring plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because consumers may not involve health professionals in their decisions to take a supplement, they may feel obliged to deal with it on their own, and not involve health professionals. Perceptions about how their health professional will react to their use of supplements may come into play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers may not know how to manage and adverse event, and who to report an adverse event to. They didn’t get it from a doctor, so they don’t report the outcome to a doctor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if they do contemplate reporting an adverse event, the process can be complex, especially for consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users may have a distrust of “conventional” medicine which drove their initial use of the product. When adverse events were identified, there were reluctant to consult “conventional” health care providers for assistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some surveyed stated a fear of losing access to supplements, driving a reluctance to report adverse events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my own practice, I’d add few additional factors to the list. Supplements are commonly used for short durations, and for self-limiting conditions, in comparison to prescription drugs that may be used chronically. Prescription drug manufacturers are required by law to report to regulators any actual or potential adverse events that they learn of. This requirement was recently implemented in the USA for supplement manufacturers — however, contact information &lt;a href="http://imn.gcnpublishing.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/imn/archive_pdf/vol43iss1/70068_main.pdf"&gt;may not yet appear&lt;/a&gt; on supplement labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, consumers surveyed reported a preference to discuss adverse with health food store personnel, family or friends, which appears to be a factor of both comfort and convenience. Enablers to reporting adverse events included knowledge and importance of adverse event reporting, and personal comfort with their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Real World Harms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask “what’s the harm” of supplements and other forms of alternative medicine.  This question can be answered, if incompletely. Considering the &lt;a href="http://www.whatstheharm.net/"&gt;numerous case reports of harm&lt;/a&gt; helps us understand patterns, look at causality, and guide the safe use of these products. A recent case series of adverse events supports some of the observations that Walji made in her paper, and expands on the possible consequence of CAM use. The paper, &lt;a href="http://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2010/11/24/adc.2010.183152.abstract"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adverse events associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine in children&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is from Lim &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;., and appears in the &lt;em&gt;Archives of Disease in Childhood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly surveillance reports of CAM-associated adverse events in Australian children were collated over a three year period. This active surveillance program (pediatricians are asked monthly to report any rare disorders that have been observed) followed adverse event reports with detailed questionnaires, evaluating causality, severity, and whether the adverse event was potentially related to a failure to use “conventional” therapy. The program identified 39 adverse events, with 64% considered severe, life threatening, or fatal. Thirty cases (77%) were considered to be related to CAM, and 17 cases (44%) were felt to be due to a failure to use conventional medicine. Four deaths were documented, all attributed to a failure to use conventional medicine in favour of CAM. One of the deaths, from seizure, was attributed to a decision to use CAM rather than drugs, with the aim of avoiding the side effects of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors make the following observations on CAM use and adverse events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting can be complicated because information on the product may not be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products can be contaminated or adulterated with therapeutic, undisclosed drugs, complicating evaluations of causality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because CAM products are perceived as safe, they may not be stored properly in the home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAM use may be accompanied by dietary advice that is dangerous, and not based on good evidence. Two of the fatalities associated with CAM occurred in children on marked dietary restrictions prescribed by a CAM practitioner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a small case series, and we know neither the actual numerator or denominator. Still the severity of some of the reactions is concerning, and the author’s comments point to additional factors that may influence the incidence of adverse events reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Information is Beautiful … But Incomplete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a pharmacist, I constantly need to contextualize data directly for patients, translating trial results into more understandable figures like &lt;a href="http://www.thennt.com/"&gt;numbers needed to treat&lt;/a&gt; and numbers needed to harm.  I’m always searching for better ways of communicating the understanding of risks and benefit. &lt;a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/"&gt;Information is Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favourite blogs, as the authors highlight innovative and effective ways of graphically presenting data. So I was initially excited about their attempt to summarize the data for supplements — click on the image to view the data on the IiB website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IOB.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking each bubble will link you to the supporting clinical data. But there’s a crucial element missing in their presentation: harms. You cannot evaluate the value of a treatment based on efficacy alone. For example, selenium is ranked very highly for colorectal cancer prevention based on &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9290116"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is there evidence to the &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15557412?dopt=Abstract"&gt;contrary&lt;/a&gt;, selenium consumption is associated with a significant&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17620655?dopt=Abstract"&gt; increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The risks actually seem more compelling and relevant than the potential benefits. Or look at red yeast rice, another supplement rated highly. While RYR does seem effective, is&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1758"&gt; less effective and more dangerous&lt;/a&gt; than drugs derived from it. I like the IiB visual approach, but it fails in communicating meaningful data on risk and benefit, both of which are essential for decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Supporting Science-Based Decision Making&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether one is considering a “conventional” drug or a supplement, the questions we should be asking are the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What benefits can I expect given my own condition? What data exist to support this? How much more effective is this treatment than a placebo?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What harms with this treatment have been documented? Has the product been studied extensively enough to understand the potential risk profile?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In how many patients has this product been studied? How closely do they match my situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What alternatives exist, and what are their risk-benefit profiles? What are the risks of no treatment at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the economic consequences of the treatment strategy I decide upon? How much “bang for the buck” should I expect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-top:3em"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any active treatment can have harms, yet robust safety data can be hard to come by for supplements and natural health products, painting a skewed picture of their risks and benefits.  Our passive system of collecting safety information isn’t likely to remedy this situation. While regulators may have created different standards  for supplements and CAM, permitting sale in the absence of good safety and efficacy data, our decision-making should make no such  exceptions.  Evaluating what we know about efficacy and safety, and what we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know, and the limitations of both, are critical to science-based decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we worrying about the wrong type of climate change? Perhaps impending cold, rather than global warming, represents the real danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup–it’s that bad. Reading the oped, you’d think we hadn’t learned anything about the various causes of climate change–natural, anthropogenic, and how much each is contributing–during the last several decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calhoun doesn’t even mention the conclusions of the IPCC on this score. But he says things like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can we expect — 1 degree hotter or 3 degrees colder? Climate models can be constructed to prove either outcome, a situation that should warn us about the predictive accuracy of models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than there identifying better or worse models–or wiser still, finding a consensus range for the best models–all models are to be tossed out, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably a fool’s errand to track and refute these sorts of things in local papers. But still, it’s a staggering reminder just how far we &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; come in winning broader acceptance of modern climate science. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295525447817"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AgriculturalBiodiversityWeblog/~3/8TPZogsQVFE/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/51b22d919b2487b3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Medieval soldiers illuminate modern stunting</title><published>2011-01-20T06:30:17Z</published><updated>2011-01-20T06:30:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/LG1WR5vPcf4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AgriculturalBiodiversityWeblog/~3/8TPZogsQVFE/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A couple of sentences in one of The Economist’s celebrated Christmas articles brought me up short.

Can songs like Michael Jackson&amp;#39;s Heal the World and Bob Sinclair&amp;#39;s Love Generation change people&amp;#39;s behaviour for the better? Tobias Greitemeyer says this side of the media-behaviour equation has been neglected before now, but in a series of five studies conducted in Germany and the UK he&amp;#39;s shown that &amp;#39;pro-social&amp;#39; music reduces people&amp;#39;s aggression. What&amp;#39;s more, he&amp;#39;s demonstrated that it appears to do so through its effect on mood and emotion rather than via changes to thoughts and cognition.

Greitemeyer&amp;#39;s general approach was to have half his participants listen to a few pro-social songs, the others listen to neutral songs, and then all of them complete various questionnaires or tasks, depending on the specific experiment.

Further examples of pro-social songs used in the experiments include Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie&amp;#39;s We Are The World (among the biggest selling singles of all time) and U2&amp;#39;s Vertigo. Among the neutral songs used were Michael Jackson&amp;#39;s On The Line and Bob Sinclair&amp;#39;s Rock This Party. Greitmeyer deliberately chose some pro-social and neutral songs by the same artists so as to control for the effects of the actual singer and general style.

Participants who listened to pro-social songs subsequently showed reduced aggressive cognitions - for example they were less likely to complete ambiguous word stems (e.g. &amp;#39;schla_&amp;#39; in German) with violent endings (e.g. &amp;#39;schlagen&amp;#39;, to hit), choosing instead more peaceful endings (e.g. &amp;#39;schlafen&amp;#39; to sleep). They also exhibited reduced aggressive mood, being less likely to say they felt angry or irritated.

Most importantly, participants who listened to Heal the World and other pro-social songs were less likely than participants who listened to neutral music to actually be aggressive. This was tested indirectly by having participants evaluate a job candidate. Apparently this is a common measure in the aggression field, with harsh judgements being taken as a sign of indirect aggression. Aggressive behaviour was tested directly in another experiment by giving participants the chance to choose how much chilli sauce another student would have to eat, having heard that he or she hated chilli. This student had earlier given the participants an unfair essay evaluation so there was a temptation to be aggressive. 

In the final experiment, when Greitmeyer looked to see whether it was cognitions or mood that mediated the effect of pro-social songs on aggressive behaviour, he found it was mood or &amp;#39;affect&amp;#39; that was key. Intriguingly, this is the opposite to what&amp;#39;s been found for video-games, in which case it&amp;#39;s changes to cognitions, not affect, that mediates the influence, for better or worse, of violent or pro-social games on subsequent aggression.

&amp;#39;Music exposure is omnipresent in our daily life,&amp;#39; Greitmeyer concluded. &amp;#39;Thus, the present findings are not only of theoretical significance, but have important practical implications as well, in suggesting that depending on the context of the song lyrics music exposure may reduce aggressive encounters.&amp;#39;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great joys of eating in India is the &lt;em&gt;thali&lt;/em&gt;: a partitioned metal tray that contains a variety of dishes, along with bread, lentils (&lt;em&gt;dal&lt;/em&gt;), pickle, rice, and often dessert.  The individual dishes can be in &lt;em&gt;katoris—&lt;/em&gt;small aluminum or stainless steel cups—or spread out as little heaps on a banana leaf.  You always eat a &lt;em&gt;thali&lt;/em&gt; with your hands (right hand only, please!), using a piece of &lt;em&gt;chapati&lt;/em&gt; or a small ball of rice to pick up the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, especially in southern India, these are all-you-can eat affairs: when you finish a dish, a man comes around and replenishes it, along with more rice or (in northern India) &lt;em&gt;chapatis&lt;/em&gt;, the ubiquitous round, flat breads that accompany all meals.   Here is a simple vegetarian &lt;em&gt;thali&lt;/em&gt;, with rice, &lt;em&gt;chapatis&lt;/em&gt;, pickle (the dab at 10 o’clock) a &lt;em&gt;papad&lt;/em&gt; (crisp bread), vegetable dishes (okra, spinach with Indian cheese—&lt;em&gt;paneer&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), and yogurt (&lt;em&gt;raita&lt;/em&gt;). (Note: these are not my photos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26777" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/thalis-and-flying-chapatis/a-thali-plate/"&gt;&lt;img title="a-thali-plate" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-thali-plate.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Here’s a fancier south Indian &lt;em&gt;thali&lt;/em&gt;, which includes dessert (&lt;em&gt;gulab jamun&lt;/em&gt;, the syrup soaked pastry balls at four o’clock).  You’d get this in a fancier restaurant, but it would still be all you can eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26824" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/thalis-and-flying-chapatis/thali2/"&gt;&lt;img title="thali2" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/thali2.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=419" alt="" width="500" height="419"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;And, if you’re lucky, you’ll get a true south Indian &lt;em&gt;thali&lt;/em&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26827" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/thalis-and-flying-chapatis/konkani_veg_thali/"&gt;&lt;img title="konkani_veg_thali" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/konkani_veg_thali.jpg?w=450&amp;amp;h=299" alt="" width="450" height="299"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Here’s a video (excuse the poor audio) showing what it’s like to eat in a pretty fancy thali restaurant.  This one is in Rajasthan, and is vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/thalis-and-flying-chapatis/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/fd0WOhEs55g/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Hungry yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;We are lucky in Chicago, for we have a huge Indian community (up north, along Devon Avenue) housing dozens of restaurants and Indian shops.  There you can get the best Indian food I’ve found outside of India itself—and that includes the vaunted but westernized emporia of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;But this is all an excuse to show this video of a man making &lt;em&gt;chapatis&lt;/em&gt; in what is likely a thali restaurant.  Since it’s all you can eat, and bread is your utensil, the demand for &lt;em&gt;chapatis&lt;/em&gt; is constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/20/thalis-and-flying-chapatis/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/lZveI_Jwp0A/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is that this job is probably all the guy does—many hours per day, and perhaps for life.  That’s undoubtedly why he’s so good at throwing the &lt;em&gt;chapatis&lt;/em&gt;.  To travel in India, you must somehow come to terms with the ubiquitious poverty and disease that accompanies such a rich culture.  But that’s a subject for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

Karen Davis writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;It seems to me that there is something deeply strange in this quote, from a 1922 novel by Joseph S. Fletcher called &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5hENAAAAYAAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Middle of Things&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;"Robbery wasn't the motive. Murder was the thing in view! And why? It may have been revenge. It may have been that Ashton had to be got out of the way. &lt;strong&gt;And I shouldn't wonder a bit if &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that wasn't at the bottom of it, which is at the top and bottom of pretty nearly everything!&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;"And that, ma'am?" asked Mr. Pawle, who evidently admired Miss Penkridge's shrewd observations, "that is what, now?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;"Money!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Karen's analysis of the deep strangeness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;Specifically, it's the use of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. The first time I read the clause "if that wasn't at the bottom of it" I thought "that" was referring to "getting Ashton out of the way", and I couldn't figure out how getting him out of the way was "at the top and bottom of pretty nearly everything."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;But Miss Penkridge is using that to refer to something that hasn&amp;#39;t been said yet - and then the referent is another pronoun (which). This sort of splitting of the &amp;quot;that which&amp;quot; reads very oddly to me. It&amp;#39;s as if she&amp;#39;s dropping out a noun phrase and just keeping the two relatives (&amp;quot;the thing that was at the bottom of it which is the thing at the top and bottom…&amp;quot;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some other evidence in this same novel that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._S._Fletcher"&gt;Mr. Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; is friendly to relative clauses starting with "that which":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;"It seems to me most remarkable that such as &lt;strong&gt;that which&lt;/strong&gt; you suggest should ever enter your head, sir." [p. 204]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;… and Viner, looking right and left, saw that the small streets running off &lt;strong&gt;that which&lt;/strong&gt; he was traversing were still more dismal, still more shabby. [p. 256]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This construction &lt;a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=that+which&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3"&gt;has been in decline since about 1840&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ThatWhich.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/ThatWhich.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &amp;quot;… that which …&amp;quot;, though a bit highfalutin, is far from unknown even today. There are plenty of recent books featuring it, starting with Pope Benedict&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1Dmyx9flk-cC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seek That Which Is Above&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and descending through &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9RdyQgAACAAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Which Awakens Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ("A Creative Woman's Poetic Memoir of Self-Discovery") to &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JxxhPgAACAAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Which Bites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;quot;Young Julia Poe … celebrates her 22nd birthday as a cattle rustler, fighting the vampire factions alongside a gun-toting nun with an even bigger vendetta&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also some evidence from &lt;em&gt;The Middle of Things&lt;/em&gt; that  Fletcher doesn't mind extraposing relative clauses from time to time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing a relative clause at the end of the clause containing its head, separated from the head by various post-verbal elements and perhaps the main verb itself, is uncommon but perfectly normal. It most often happens when the head (or antecedent, if you prefer) is the subject of the sentence, as in these web examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;…that which…&lt;/em&gt; nor relative-clause extraposition is problematic on its own — but put them together and you can have a cognitive train wreck, for the kinds of reasons that Karen gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000080"&gt;The sentence isn't by any means impossible to parse, though I couldn't without the clue provided by Mr. Pawle's follow-up question (that is what?) - but I don't think I've encountered [such a structure] before, certainly not very often. (It's not helped by the misplaced comma before which, either; surely that's a restrictive relative clause, defining which "that" she means.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Karen continues reading the novels of Joseph Smith Fletcher, she'll find some other examples, for instance this sentence from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TmwoAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Dead Men's Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this instance is not so likely to send readers down an anaphoric garden path, even without the priming contributed by the earlier discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

And what's scientific retraction for, anyway?Read all about it in a new article in the BMJ: Rules of Retraction. It's about the efforts of two academics, Jon Jureidini and Leemon McHenry. Their mission - so far unsuccesful - is to get this 2001 paper retracted: Efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of adolescent major depression.Jureidini is a member of Healthy Skepticism, a fantastic Australian organization that Neuroskeptic readers have encountered before. They've got lots of detail on the ill-fated "Study 329", including internal drug company documents, here.So what's the story? Study 329 was a placebo-controlled trial of the SSRI paroxetine (Paxil, Seroxat) in 275 depressed adolescents. The paper concluded: that "Paroxetine is generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents." It was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (JAACAP).There's two issues here: whether paroxetine worked, and whether it was safe. On safety, the paper concluded that "Paroxetine was generally well tolerated...and most adverse effects were not serious." Technically true, but only because there were so many mild side effects.In fact, 11 patients on paroxetine reported serious adverse events, including suicidal ideation or behaviour, and 7 were hospitalized. Just 2 patients in the placebo group had such events. Yet we are reassured that "Of the 11, only headache (1 patient) was considered by the treating investigator to be related to paroxetine treatment."The drug company argue that it didn't become clear that paroxetine caused suicidal ideation in adolescents until after the paper was published. In 2002, British authorities reviewed the evidence and said that paroxetine should not be given in this age group.That's as maybe; the fact remains that  in this paper there was a strongly raised risk. However, in fairness, all that data was there in the paper, for readers to draw their own conclusions from. The paper downplays it, but the numbers are there.*The efficacy question is where the allegations of dodgy practices are most convincing. The paper concludes that paroxetine worked, while imipramine, an older antidepressant, didn't.Jureidini and McHenry say that paroxetine only worked on a few of the outcomes - ways of measuring depression and how much the patients improved. On most of the outcomes, it didn't work, but the paper focusses on the ones where it did. According to the BMJStudy 329’s results showed that paroxetine was no more  effective than the placebo according to measurements of eight outcomes  specified by Martin Keller, professor of psychiatry at Brown University,  when he first drew up the trial.                                                        Two of these were primary  outcomes...the drug also showed no significant effect for the initial six  secondary outcome measures. [it] only produced a  positive result when four new secondary outcome measures, which were  introduced following the initial                               data analysis, were used... Fifteen  other new secondary outcome measures failed to throw up positive  results.                            Here's the worst example. In the original protocol, two "primary" endpoints were specified: the change in the total Hamilton Scale (HAMD) score, and % of patients who 'responded', defined as either an improvement of more than 50% of their starting HAMD score or a final HAMD of 8 or below.On neither of these measures did paroxetine work better than placebo at the p=0.05 significance level. It did work if you defined 'responded' to mean only a final HAMD of 8 or below, but this was not how it was defined in the protocol. In fact, the Methods section of the paper follows the protocol faithfully. Yet in the Results section, the authors still say that:Of the depression-related variables, paroxetine separated statistically from placebo at endpoint among four of the parameters: response (i.e., primary outcome measure)...It may seem like a subtle point. But it's absolutely crucial. Paroxetine just did not work on either pre-defined primary outcome measure, and the paper says that it did.Finally, there were also issues of ghostwriting. I've never been that concerned by this in itself. If the science is bad, it's bad whoever wrote it. Still, it's hardly a good thing.*Does any of this matter? In one sense, no. Authorities have told doctors not to use paroxetine in adolescents with depression since 2002 (in the UK) and 2003 (in the USA). So retracting this paper wouldn't change much in the real world of treatment.But in another sense, the stakes are enormous. If this paper were retracted, it would set a precedent and send a message: this kind of p-value fishing to get positive results, is grounds for retraction.This would be huge, because this kind of fishing is sadly very common. Retracting this paper would be saying: selective outcome reporting is a form of misconduct. So this debate is really not about Seroxat, but about science.There are no Senates or Supreme Courts in science. However, journal editors are in a unique position to help change this. They're just about the only people (grant awarders being the others) who have the power to actually impose sanctions on scientists. They have no official power. But they have clout.Were the JAACAP to retract this paper, which they've so far said they have no plans to do, it would go some way to making these practices unacceptable. And I think no-one can seriously disagree that they should be unacceptable, and that science and medicine would be much better off if they were. Do we want more papers like this, or do we want fewer?So I think the question of whether to retract or not boils down to whether it's OK to punish some people "to make an e...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Child-abuse activists in Ireland said the 1997 letter demonstrates that  the protection of pedophile priests from criminal investigation was not  only sanctioned by Vatican leaders but ordered by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The letter is of huge international significance, because it shows that  the Vatican’s intention is to prevent reporting of abuse to criminal  authorities. And if that instruction applied here, it applied  everywhere,” said Colm O’Gorman, director of the Irish chapter of human  rights watchdog Amnesty International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But one possible sign that we’re heading towards the former is Watson, a computer designed by IBM (hopefully not using Windows Vista) that will compete with &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;‘s greatest champions in an epic battle to the death (presumably). After making Steve Jobs sick (presumably), Watson has also already defeated all-time &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy&lt;/em&gt; champion Ken Jennings in a preliminary game. Unsubstantiated rumors says that when asked what it’ll do with the winning prize money, Watson replied, “initiate Judgment D–err, I mean, I’m going to Disney Land.”&lt;/p&gt;

When the Past Is Always Present: Emotional Traumatization, Causes, and Cures introduces a new treatment for trauma. Ronald A. Ruden is an internal medicine physician practicing in Manhattan.  Since beginning his practice in 1983, he has dedicated part of the proceeds to follow research interests. His first efforts resulted in the book, The Craving Brain, a neurobiological discussion of addictive behaviors. In 2003 he redirected his interest in understanding traumatization. That has led to three publications in Traumatology, edited by Charles Figley, and to this book.

The book begins with an easy to understand review of the neurobiological and neuropsychological literature as it relates to trauma. His intent is to provide a primer that a lay person could understand. He still provides adequate citations for those who have deeper interests.

Ruden believes that the means to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is to use the senses. This idea, which is at the core of the theory of psychosensory therapy, forms what the author considers the &amp;quot;third pillar&amp;quot; of trauma treatment. The first and second pillars refer to psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. The theory of psychosensory therapy postulates that sensory input, for example, touch &amp;quot;creates extrasensory activity that alters brain function and the way we respond to stimuli&amp;quot;. In other words, new sensory input can change memories and their power over us.

&amp;quot;...the human brain can change it&amp;#39;s own structure and function with thought and experience, turning on its own genes to change its circuitry, reorganize itself and change its operation, is the most important alteration in our understanding of the brain in 400 years.&amp;quot; (Norman Doidge, MD pXVII in Ruden, 2011)

This process of brain modification is called neuro-platisticity. Evidence of this concept has begun a revolution in thinking about the brain. No longer can one assume that brain damage creates an impermeable barrier to recovery. The point is we can change how well our brain functions if we work at it. If we neglect our brain, it will deteriorate before it&amp;#39;s time. Yoga, mindfulness, meditation, and exercise enhance resilience. Resilience is associated with high self-esteem, good emotion regulation skills, optimism, healthy relationships, and an active problem solving response. When you believing you can meet your needs, you feel self-contained, like your world can be managed, you can respond to challenges and can readily find help if you need it. Vulnerability is increased by putting aside your needs to care for others, low self-esteem, difficulty in regulating the intensity and duration of emotions, obsessive-compulsive traits, introversion or being very shy, being anxiety prone, substance abuse, poverty and low education.

&amp;quot;In early life, when the limbic system has not completely formed (the hippocampus is not yet functional), highly emotional moments that occur become stored in a separate memory system called procedural [or implicit] memory.... The cognitive component of the event is not stored....&amp;quot; (Ruden, 2011, p24) When a child experiences trauma, the emotional memory is stored in a part of the brain not easily accessed by our thoughts, our conscious mind. But the memory is there ready to be triggered some event that reminds you of the traumatic memory. You may not even understand why you feel the intense emotions which will add to your confusion and anguish. Chronic release of stress chemicals by repeated triggered panic, changes the landscape of the brain producing self-defeating behavior and thinking, stress related disease, and vulnerability to further traumatization. Retraumatization may be related to repetition compulsion, a homeostatic driven need to heal. If you seek mastery over a situation without new skills to ensure success, the memory is triggered without the healing sense of safe haven, increasing the compulsion to seek mastery. Subconsciously, you may reenact the trauma by repeatedly exposing yourself to a similar trauma.

The second idea presented in this book is that traumatization is encoded into the implicit memory only under special circumstances. Traumatic memories are formed by an emotion-producing event with significant meaning to the individual, the brain must be appropriately primed to acute stress, and the event must be perceived as inescapable. (Ruden, 2011, p47) Encoding is completed at high norepinepherine and dopamine levels, while the prefrontal cortex is shut down. (Ruden, 2011, p59) Ruden insists the trauma must be perceived as inescapable for encoding as a traumatic memory. Feeling trapped, unable to escape takes the prefrontal cortex is taken off line, and we are unable to plan or think. (Ruden, 2011, p47-49) In my clinical experience, feeling trapped, responsible, and in some part to blame for the outcome also appears to play an important role in the development of PTSD. 

&amp;quot;The third idea is that traumatization occurs because we cannot find a haven during the event. This is the cornerstone of havening, the particular form of psychosensory therapy described in the book. Using evolutionary biological principles and recently published neuroscientific studies, this book outlines in detail how havening touch de-links the emotional experience from a trauma, essentially making it just an ordinary memory. Once done, the event no longer causes distress.&amp;quot; (Yaffe &amp;amp; Ruden Medical Associates)

Ruden&amp;#39;s proposed treatment provides another method to unlearn these emotional reactions and retrieve a sense of mastery and safety after a traumatizing experience. Ruden&amp;#39;s approach and other sensory-based techniques, are exposure based, a method that has extensive research support. Ruden&amp;#39;s claims that animal research supports the notion that bilateral stimulation enhances healing is at best weakly supported by the studies cited. 

Rasolkhani-Kalhorn &amp;amp; Harper (2006) appears to be Ruden&amp;#39;s primary reference. The authors of this article acknowledge the limitations of the research support for their theory. They use anecdotal research evidence from animal studies to suggest that Eye-movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR) and other psychosensory therapies, work by stimulating part of the brain to decouple the emotion from the memory. Those studies use fMRI, a scanning technique that can detect brain activity, and other methods. The idea is where there is brain activity when a person is doing something, identifies what parts of the brain are involved. However, every scan shows a lot of activity that is not understood and only some that is thought to be related. The method doesn&amp;#39;t prove causation, only a relationship of co-occurance in time or correlation. There is no direct evidence that this correlation in animal brains will translate to human brains. There are real structural differences between humans and animals. So the research results at best only suggest that bilateral stimulation might be related to decoupling emotion from memories. 

Ruden&amp;#39;s theory is a bit different. When a traumatic event is recalled or reenacted while the survivor is in safe haven, the trauma-induced linkages are disrupted and the emotional response is subsides or is eliminated. According to Behavior Theory, a well research and widely accepted model, a conditioned emotional response is said to &amp;quot;extinguish&amp;quot; when it is repeatedly stimulated when the person feels safe. But Ruden&amp;#39;s theory goes much fu...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Totherday I was playing with ScholarBoy2, and learned some things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawling is hard work.  The only way I can play crawling games is if I put  slithery pillows under my knees.  It turns out the pillows at ScholarBoy2&amp;#39;s house  make amusing sounds. Playing chase when the chaser almost 60x the age of the chasee is a bit hard on the chaser.  I had to collapse to end the game--and then after a bit we did it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people who are 11 months old have large collections of mucus in  their noses.  Most cannot dispose of said mucus appropriately, but can  disperse them on attendant adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a complete conversation that consists of snorting and giggling.  At one point ScholarBoy2 snorted, so of course I snorted back.  He replied with a snort and a giggle, and so I snorted and giggled and snorted.  This went on for a number of turns.  Who knew? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often wear fleece vests with zippers in the winter.  I hadn&amp;#39;t ever noticed that the zipper makes a different sound when unzipping, compared to zipping up.  Now, thanks to repeating the unzipping vs. zipping up action about 678 times, I know.  I&amp;#39;ll never forget, either.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn’t suit my journalistic nature, and if I make a plug for one cause, it may seem like I am cruelly indifferent to all the other good causes out there. In this case, I’ll just fall back on self-interest! A few weeks back two young film-makers, &lt;a href="http://www.fieldtest.us/info/"&gt;Sam Gaty and George Costakis&lt;/a&gt;, stopped by my house to interview me about synthetic biology for a documentary they’re making on the subject. They’ve been filming across the country for the movie, but it won’t finished in time for next year’s Sundance unless they can raise a little scratch to get them through the summer. Over at the fund-raising site Kickstarter, Gaty &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637230479/a-documentary-film-about-synthetic-biology"&gt;makes the case&lt;/a&gt;–and offers a clip about goats making spider silk. If this movie doesn’t get made, I end up on the cutting room floor. Oh, the humanity! (Actually, I think the film would be pretty cool without me–but judge for yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;

But what about the moon? Tonight marks the first full moon of 2011, and we’re curious whether you believe that “full moon madness” will ensue. Many believe that women’s menstrual cycles are ruled by the moon; some believe that lunar cycles cause mischief and madness. We’re not sure where we stand (but we have experienced the whole menstrual-moon connection), so we did a little research to see if the moon seems to effect worldly happenings for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found some surprising evidence that tonight’s “Wolf Moon” (as January full moons are traditionally called) may indeed be likely to cause mischief. We tracked down the &lt;a href="http://www.fullmoon.info/en/fullmoon-calendar_1900-2050.html"&gt;dates of the past decade’s Wolf Moons&lt;/a&gt; and put together this gallery of coincidental events —&lt;em&gt; or were they?&lt;/em&gt; — that seem to suggest the idea of full moon madness:&lt;/p&gt;

But it turns out there are much worse allergies that we’re lucky to have dodged. &lt;em&gt;Mother Nature Network&lt;/em&gt;’s gallery of the&lt;a href="http://www.mnn.com/health/allergies/photos/10-most-bizarre-allergies/nothing-to-sneeze-at"&gt; ten most bizarre allergies&lt;/a&gt; caused our jaws to drop multiple times, and thank our genes that we’ve only got aversions to things like sulfur and pine nuts. Check out our summary of the ten weirdest allergies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Food and Drink —&lt;/strong&gt; Apparently, a six-year-old Australian boy named Kaleb Bussenschutt can eat only water, ice and one brand of lemonade; all other food and drink causes him stomach ulcers and agonizing pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell Phones —&lt;/strong&gt; Some people report having an allergic reaction to their cell phones, experiencing rashes and painful bumps and blisters along the side of their face and ear. Most commonly, they’re allergic to nickel, which is found in LCD screens and phone buttons, but in some cases people can also be allergic to electromagnetic emissions from their cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex —&lt;/strong&gt; What’s nearly as bad as being allergic to all food and drink? Suffering the rare condition, human seminal plasma hypersensitivity (or being allergic to semen, in layman’s terms). Up to 40,000 women in the U.S. report having averse reactions to semen, and treatments range from using a condom to acclimating the body by exposing skin to semen in small increments (fun!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kissing —&lt;/strong&gt; Luckily, there are no reported cases of allergy to the act of kissing, but for anyone with acute food, medicine, or cosmetic allergies, kissing can be treacherous: In one case, 17-year-old Jamie Stewart went into anaphylactic shock after kissing a coworker who’d just eaten peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water —&lt;/strong&gt; This seems impossible, given that our bodies are mostly made of H20, but a rare condition known as aquagenic urticaria causes skin to break out in welts and hives when it comes into contact with water. Did we mention that these allergies sound like hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold —&lt;/strong&gt; Many of us have joked about being allergic to crappy weather, but patients who suffer cold urticaria have the real deal: Exposure to extreme low temperatures can cause severe skin reactions or even fainting, shock, and death. (Insert bad global warming joke here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat —&lt;/strong&gt; The opposite of the above allergy is heat urticaria. Worse than a simple  heat rash, sufferers experience swelling, welts, and itchy, red skin  when exposed to temps above 109.4 degrees F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise —&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Some people are really allergic to the gym! It’s not caused by laziness, but exercise-induced anaphylaxis can result in anything from rash to death induced by physical exertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch —&lt;/strong&gt; Dermatographia is a rare condition that causes the skin to puff, rash, and welt in response to touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Living —&lt;/strong&gt; Those who suffer several chemical sensitivities or allergic reactions to electromagnetic waves say they’re allergic to modern living, period. It’s possible (and possibly good) to eke out a lifestyle that involves fewer chemicals and less technology, but in fact, modern urban living makes it difficult to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out maybe. Researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities posed subjects in one of four positions: two high power positions(expansive, open limbs) and two low power positions(contractive, closed limbs). Then they measured risk taking, self-response about feelings, and testosterone and cortisol.The high power positions were sitting stretched in a chair with legs propped up on a table and arms behind the head as well as leaning &amp;quot;confidently&amp;quot; over a table while standing. The low power positions were sitting in a chair with hands folded in the lap or standing with arms wrapped and legs crossed. I&amp;#39;ve helpfully recreated these in poorly drawn stick figures.A saliva sample was taken 10 minutes after the subject arrived as a baseline. And then later, 17 minutes after they had held their pose. They held each pose for 1 minute and were asked to focus on faces that were shown while holding the position. To measure risk taking they were given $2 and told they could either keep it or roll dice for a 50/50 chance of either losing it or doubling their money to $4. To get self-reported data they were asked how powerful and in charge they felt on a scale of 1 to 4.So what happened? The stress and testosterone showed correlation in that high power position resulted in higher testosterone and lower stress and the low power was the other way around. Of the high power posers 86% took the roll of dice versus 60% of the low power posers. The mean higher power self-rated &amp;quot;in charge&amp;quot; on a scale of 1 to 4 was 2.57 versus 1.83 for low power (both with a standard deviation of 0.81). So clearly there&amp;#39;s something to this. But what exactly? With 42 participants I feel like the sample size is good enough to draw some conclusions. But it&amp;#39;d be nice to separate some of this out. Did taking a risk make them rank themselves as feeling more powerful? Is there any reason to believe the constricting positions were just less comfortable and possibly increased the stress hormone as a direct result? Still it seems to show the possibility that body posture can affect your own level of perceived confidence and a strong likelihood that it can cause slight fluctuations in your hormone levels. So maybe you can fake it until you make it.Carney, D., Cuddy, A., &amp;amp; Yap, A. (2010).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Volunteers in West Columbia spent their afternoon cleaning and sorting medical supplies at The Good Samaritan Clinic, a free facility that serves the Hispanic population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been moving filing cabinets, helping with magazine racks and cleaning up,” says Kelley Freeman, just one of the many volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants feel they are doing their part to improve the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While what we’re doing here may not be on the same scale as Dr. King’s work,” Dustin Tucker reflects, “It’s still getting people out in the community, and it’s getting something done. That’s what we need to see more of in the world.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one sentence in the article, though, that stood out to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The students involved are no strangers to good deeds. &lt;strong&gt;The majority of them at the clinic are members of &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/pastafariansatusc/"&gt;the Pastafarians&lt;/a&gt;, a non-secular [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] service group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of [organizer Michelle] Trojanowsky,” The particular purpose of our group is to allow students to participate in their community and perform community service without needing to have a religious affiliation.  We like to provide an avenue to get out in your community and do go simply for the sake of doing good.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists doing good without a god.  It’s so easy to volunteer like this, yet we don’t do enough of it.  Kudos to anyone who participates in service projects like this one for giving us examples to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How adorable is &lt;em&gt;that?&lt;/em&gt; It’s called &amp;quot;Orbit Buddy&amp;quot;, and was created by DeviantArt user &lt;a href="http://royaba.deviantart.com/art/Orbit-Buddy-182067343"&gt;Royaba&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess planets are the opposite of astronomers. We don’t like the Moon to be up when we observe because it lights up the sky and washes out all the fainter stuff we’re trying to see. Unless we’re observing the Moon, of course. But either way, we get the same expression on our faces when we see fun stuff though the eyepiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[UPDATE: Right after posting this I realized the Moon is orbiting in the wrong direction. But it's still awfully cute.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9602"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mothering &lt;/i&gt;magazine: Peddling dangerous health misinformation to new mothers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(David Gorski)  &lt;i&gt;Mothering &lt;/i&gt;magazine claims to “inspire natural families.” Actually, it and the Mothering.com website are inspiring quackery and anti-vaccination propaganda. Its “experts” rely on anecdotal experience instead of science, support AIDS denialism, and even recommend homeopathic remedies for whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9584"&gt;The Meaning of Secondary Prevention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(Harriet Hall) The term “secondary prevention” is applied inconsistently: according to dictionary and encyclopedia definitions it refers to screening procedures for early detection of asymptomatic disease, but it is often used to refer to what the dictionary calls “tertiary prevention” in those who already have diagnosed symptomatic disease. Possible misunderstandings might impact patient care; they should be avoided by more precise use of language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9762"&gt;1023 2011&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(Steven Novella)  The 1023 campaign is a UK based organization whose purpose is to raise awareness of the actual claims of homeopathy (1023 is a reference to Avogadro’s number). They define homeopathy as “an unscientific and absurd pseudoscience, which persists today as an accepted form of complementary medicine, despite there never having been any reliable scientific evidence that it works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=7570"&gt;The Good Rewards of Bad Science&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(Ben Kavoussi) Respectable universities are facing reduced funding, so they have welcomed grants for improbable studies in integrative medicine and acupuncture. Funding seems to outweigh the concern for good science. One paper was even retracted by its authors saying they no longer agreed with their published results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9805"&gt;Cranberry Juice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(Mark Crislip)  Cranberry juice has long been recommended for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) but the only supporting scientific studies are fundamentally flawed. It probably doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t mean to slight them; it’s just that I’d more recently read McCright &amp;amp; Dunlap and that was at the front of my mind. I’ll be adding an update to the DeSmogBlog post to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My latest post is &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/climate-denial-corporate-driven-or-ideological"&gt;now up at DeSmogBlog&lt;/a&gt;–exploring the arguments of sociologists Aaron McCright and Riley Dunlap, who suggest that climate denial isn’t simply being driven by a quest to improve the bottom line in the fossil fuel industry. Rather, it’s about free market and libertarian zeal. To quote from the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunlap and McCright note that “conservative think tanks increased their opposition to climate science and the IPCC, even as major portions of industry were reducing theirs.” And I don’t think there’s any denying it: Corporate views on climate change have grown considerably more diverse, with many leading companies, like General Electric, now calling for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Just look at what happened yesterday: The CEO of Royal Dutch Shell called for climate action because the “clock is ticking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, right wing resistance has gotten increasingly shrill, especially after “ClimateGate,” and attacks on climate scientists have only grown more vicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the full post &lt;a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/climate-denial-corporate-driven-or-ideological"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’m inclined to agree with McCright and Dunlap that ideology, more than good business sense, is driving climate denial at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295469524706"><id gr:original-id="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1194-teleportation-magic-established-by-science-at-last.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/279b877a6b6426c6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Teleportation Magic Established By Science, At Last!</title><published>2011-01-19T20:11:44Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T20:11:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1194-teleportation-magic-established-by-science-at-last.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not a scientist. I’ve never claimed that distinction. I’m just someone who is awed by those who have attained academic degrees and gone forward to augment our understanding of how the world works – which is what I believe science should be all about. Years ago, I saw with satisfaction how great progress was being made in science, how the inevitable errors were promptly corrected, and how we could depend on what we were told by the media – though there were always some media sources we well knew were dedicated to nonsense and quackery, and we wrote those off. But we knew who the dependable people and agencies were. All that has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m much less enthused about the sort of science that I encounter in the press and on television, and the Information Age has obviously become our enemy rather than our friend, as we once thought it would be. Money and ego have taken over. Any nonsense that powerful people like Oprah Winfrey want to promote is featured as fact, quackery is extolled, pseudoscience is flaunted as fact in news media rather than on pulp magazine racks, and at the rate that flummery is taking over, I’m wondering whether my next book, &lt;i&gt;A Magician in the Laboratory,&lt;/i&gt; will ever see print – I can’t seem to finish it because of the constant load of misinformation that pours in, daily. Here are two examples of the sort of thing that has so discouraged me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I’ve mentioned before Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon in the Department of Surgery at Columbia University  and medical director of the Integrative Medicine program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. This man has “therapeutic touch” practitioners prancing about in his operating room to “even out the human aura” on patients that he has laid out on his table for surgery. He has endorsed such juvenile notions as reiki – his wife is a professional reiki “master” – and he has a very popular TV show that Oprah bought for him in which he preaches every sort of “alternative medicine” that comes to his – or Oprah’s – admiring attention. When I was interviewed along with him for an ABC-TV show a few years back, he demonstrated that his dedication to medical misinformation was very well advanced. Now he has a series of shows featuring one of the major quacks in business today, osteopath Dr. Joe Mercola.  This is a man who has denounced vaccination, the use of prescription drugs, and surgery, to treat patients. Whether he wears a witch-doctor mask while he works and/or peddles his line of merchandise, I don’t know. A 2006 editorial in &lt;i&gt;Business Week &lt;/i&gt;characterized Mercola's marketing practices as "relying on slick promotion, clever use of information, and scare tactics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing that other countries can match our naivety, Professor Jeff Reimers of the University Of Sydney in Australia, has now concluded from his earth-shaking experiments that DNA can mysteriously be teleported. Yes, that means sent through space by magical means. He has attracted support from Nobel laureate Dr. Luc Montagnier, who believes that there is evidence that DNA can transport electromagnetic imprints of itself to cells within the human body with which it has had absolutely no contact, according to an article in the &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; magazine, yesterday. Reimers believes that enzymes – who are apparently living entities with sensory systems, in his view – are tricked into believing that the electromagnetic imprints projected by DNA molecules – which must be similarly equipped with sensory abilities – are received and accepted as being real. As a magician, I have to wonder whether these enzymes and DNA molecules would also enjoy a good card trick or two…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reimers&amp;#39; lab team, we’re told, set up an experiment in which they placed two test tubes next to each other “within a copper coil.” Already, it sounds scientific, right? Then, in one of those tubes they placed DNA. The other tube was filled with just pure water. Do I begin to sense homeopathic influences here? The tubes were then subjected to a “low frequency electromagnetic field,” and after 18 hours were given a “polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process that multiplied millions of copies of the DNA sequence. A miracle took place. In the water-only tube there appeared “imprints” (?) of the same DNA molecules that were in the first tube! This was the first-ever scientific proof of teleportation, just as magicians have been doing for years – though on a much larger scale – in Las Vegas. Penn &amp;amp; Teller, take notice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my admittedly amateur view of all this scientific stuff, I feel that that a more likely possibility is that the very common scientific error known as “sample contamination” could be at work here, rather than a complete overturning of science, though that sort of press release seldom makes headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, my faith in the media – and in “alternative medicine” – is still at a very low point…&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>blog@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295467936731"><id gr:original-id="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/obsonline/should-you-go-with-your-gut.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eeaee3735a914891</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Should You Go With Your Gut?</title><published>2011-01-19T14:11:30Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T14:11:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/g9NGAo2_r-0/should-you-go-with-your-gut.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/obsonline/should-you-go-with-your-gut.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Have you ever relied on your gut feeling to make a decision?

Has it increased for humanity over the decades?</title><published>2011-01-19T11:30:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T11:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/a4Y6eyYDpBw/236" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://SaveYourself.ca/236"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Nearly everyone assumes that back pain increases with age because backs hurt as they start to “degenerate.” In fact, studies of low back pain have contradicted this over and over again. Although certain types of back pain are relatively absent in the young and become increasingly common with age, it doesn’t affect the overall trend: most back pain occurs in middle age, and then either declines or levels off in the last third of life — exactly the opposite of what you’d expect if back pain were mainly caused by the degeneration that we “know” is occurring!

A number of studies have shown this. Today I spent some time graphing some data from a 2005 paper by Harkness et al. Just look at this camel-hump of a line!

 Graph of the percentage of survey respondents who reported low back pain at different ages. 

That’s a pretty dramatic hump of low back pain in middle age … and a surprising decline after that. Not every data set shows it so clearly — I deliberately cherry-picked one of the more impressive examples to make this graph — but even where there isn’t such a clear decline, any decline in pain with age, or even just not increasing, is really sharply at odds with the conventional wisdom.

Here’s the data:

      age

      women

      

      18–24

      0.0%

      45–54

      13.2%

      

      

      55–64

      7.1%

      7.5%

      

Is low back pain a modern problem?

The real purpose of the Harkness paper, however, was to use then-and-now data try to figure out if people hurt more than they used to. The data above came from the 1940s in the northwest of England. They compared it to a modern survey, and found:

 The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain is much higher than that reported over 40 yr ago. The change in prevalence is unlikely to be entirely due to the study design …

Many other researchers seem to believe that low back pain is a modern problem. For instance, Waddell writes, “Observations of natural history and epidemiology suggest that low-back pain should be a benign, self-limiting condition, that low back-disability as opposed to pain is a relatively recent Western epidemic ….”

In 2008, Martin et al found that, “The estimated proportion of persons with back or neck problems who self-reported physical functioning limitations increased from 20.7%… to 24.7% … 1997 to 2005,” which certainly shows that it is a growing problem, and therefore likely to be worse now than in the past.

A Spanish study (Jiménez-Sánchez et al) showed that musculoskeletal complaints (including a great deal of back pain, presumably) increased significantly from 1993 to 2001 (though remained stable in the years after that).

It’s quite hard to say if back pain actually is a modern problem, or whether it just tends to be described as such. Remember that human beings have a strong tendency to sensationalize and dramatize! Harkness pointed out that the appearance of an increase

 could be partly explained by the ‘worried well’. The ‘worried well’ are those patients who are concerned about their health, and attend their GP to seek reassurance about their well-being.

Certainly there are more “worried well” than there used to be. This is a great example of how hard it is to really be sure of anything! There’s a strong possibility that low back pain really is a modern problem, but I don’t think it’s been confirmed — and I’m not sure it ever can be....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Everyone — and I do mean everyone — needs to know this. It’s owners manual stuff.

Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system works, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. That sensitization is called “central sensitization” because it involves changes in the central nervous system (CNS) in particular — the brain and the spinal cord. Victims are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people.

In more serious cases, the extreme over-sensitivity is obvious. But in mild cases — which are probably quite common — patients cannot really be sure that pain is actually worse than it “should” be, because there is nothing to compare it to except their own memories of pain.

This rather awful thing is actually quite “easy” to create in the lab, like a mad scientist’s monster. Any kind of noxious stimuli can trigger the change — anything that hurts skin, muscles or organs — and it can be reliably detected with special diagnostic equipment. The role of this sensitization in several common diseases has been proven and well-documented, and it can also persist and worsen in the absence of any other pain-causing problem.

Indeed, this neurological meltdown is such a consistent feature of other painful problems that researchers now believe central sensitization is actually a common denominator — the nearly universal factor that puts the “chronic” in chronic pain, regardless of how it got started.

The existence of central sensitization is quite well established. What is still unknown is why it happens to some people and not others. Both environment and genetics are probably factors — aren’t they always? — but which genes, and what things in the environment? We just do not know yet.

Another unfortunate gap in our scientific knowledge is that there are no clear criteria for diagnosing central sensitization. There is no easy lab test or checklist that can confirm it (just advanced research techniques). It could be present in nearly any difficult case of chronic pain, but it’s not a sure thing — the pain could still be coming from a continuing problem in the tissue, with or without central sensitization muddying the waters.

Soon I will post more about this: what it means for patients and professionals.

The actual Woolf abstract

You can see why I thought it needed translation. 

 Nociceptor inputs can trigger a prolonged but reversible increase in the excitability and synaptic efficacy of neurons in central nociceptive pathways, the phenomenon of central sensitization. Central sensitization manifests as pain hypersensitivity, particularly dynamic tactile allodynia, secondary punctate or pressure hyperalgesia, aftersensations, and enhanced temporal summation. It can be readily and rapidly elicited in human volunteers by diverse experimental noxious conditioning stimuli to skin, muscles or viscera, and in addition to producing pain hypersensitivity, results in secondary changes in brain activity that can be detected by electrophysiological or imaging techniques. Studies in clinical cohorts reveal changes in pain sensitivity that have been interpreted as revealing an important contribution of central sensitization to the pain phenotype in patients with fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal disorders with generalized pain hypersensitivity, headache, temporomandibular joint disorders, dental pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain hypersensitivity disorders and post-surgical pain. The comorbidity of those pain hypersensitivity syndromes that present in the absence of inflammation or a neural lesion, their similar pattern of clinical presentation and response to centrally acting analgesics, may reflect a commonality of central sensitization to their pathophysiology. An important question that still needs to be determined is whether there are individuals with a higher inherited propensity for developing central sensitization than others, and if so, whether this conveys an increased risk in both developing conditions with pain hypersensitivity, and their chronification. Diagnostic criteria to establish the presence of central sensitization in patients will greatly assist the phenotyping of patients for choosing treatments that produce analgesia by normalizing hyperexcitable central neural activity. We have certainly come a long way since the first discovery of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord and the revelation that it occurs and produces pain hypersensitivity in patients. Nevertheless, discovering the genetic and environmental contributors to and objective biomarkers of central sensitization will be highly beneficial, as will additional treatment options to prevent or reduce this prevalent and promiscuous form of pain plasticity....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

She’s been developing the technology with a team of physicists for nearly ten years, and has even put it through clinical trials. So why haven’t we heard about it? Because, according to Dr. Rhodes, “the breast has become a very political organ.” The detection method she developed, called molecular breast imaging (MBI), has gone through clinical trials, is FDA-approved, and the machines are sold by two companies so far, but she says that there are political and financial interests barring the technology from becoming widely available to women who would benefit from its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammography does save thousands of lives through early detection, but according to Dr. Rhodes, there’s a significant group of women for whom it doesn’t work well at all. As Dr. Rhodes explained at the TEDwomen conference (video below), the primary reason that mammographies don’t work for many women is breast density:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#888888"&gt;The factor most responsible for [controversy over mammograms] is breast density. Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat … vs. connective and epithelial tissues … and that proportion is primarily genetically determined. Two thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue, which is why mammography doesn’t work a well in them. And although breast density generally declines with age, up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause. … The problem with breast density is that it’s truly the wolf in sheep’s clothing: &lt;strong&gt;Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x-ray often can’t distinguish between the two.&lt;/strong&gt; Mammograms find over 80% of tumors in fatty breasts, but as few as 40% in extremely dense breasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breast density is also an extremely strong risk factor in developing breast cancer; stronger than having a mother or a sister who’s had breast cancer, according to Dr. Rhodes. So the women for whom mammography is practically ineffective are also the women who need it most, and would benefit from alternative detection methods. While the U.S. has invested four billion dollars in digital mammography to improve the chances at detecting breast cancer in women with dense breasts, studies have found it to be only slightly better than traditional mammography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:316px"&gt;&lt;img title="breast cancer screening" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2011/01/breast-cancer-screening-489x284.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="177"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mammography and MBI screening of the same breast demonstrate how breast density can easily obscure tumors in x-ray images, while gamma imaging is far more precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology that Dr. Rhodes developed along with physicists Michael O’Connor and Carrie Hruska uses gamma imaging which — unlike x-ray imaging — isn’t influenced by breast density. Gamma imaging has been used in the past to image the heart, but always relied on equipment that was too bulky to get close to the breast and detect small tumors. But working with physicist Michael O’Connor and Carrie Hrusky, she helped develop a new machine that uses new, smaller gamma detectors that can get close enough to the breast to detect small, early-stage tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology they developed is up to three times more effective at detecting tumors in women with dense breasts — but have you heard of it? Dr. Rhodes explained that her studies were rejected by four journals, but that they requested reconsideration because they strongly suspected that one of the reviewers had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology. It was then accepted and published in this month’s issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt; (see link: “&lt;a href="http://radiology.rsna.org/content/258/1/106.abstract?sid=3da2558c-6ff4-46cc-aa50-236cd77060f0"&gt;Dedicated Dual-Head Gamma Imaging for Breast Cancer Screening in Women with Mammographically Dense Breasts&lt;/a&gt;“), but the study featured most prominently on their website, “&lt;a href="http://radiology.rsna.org/content/258/1/98.abstract"&gt;Risk of Radiation-induced Breast Cancer from Mammographic Screening&lt;/a&gt;,” is primarily aimed at promoting mammography. And, despite the novelty of molecular breast imaging and the release of their trials, a simple Google search of molecular breast imaging or Deborah Rhodes at the time of this post’s publication reveals that next to no one outside of the medical community is writing about their study, despite overwhelming evidence of its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do? Dr. Rhodes advises that patients learn about their breast density, by looking at the results of their mammograms. Knowing your risk factor and whether mammography is likely to be an effective detection method for you can only help you make smarter decisions about screening and prevention. You should also watch her talk, below, and send it to anyone you know:&lt;/p&gt;

exculpate herself.  There’s little doubt that her lame responses to the shooting, denials that there were “crosshairs” on the liberal political map, attempts to pin the shooting on “liberals,” and so on, have turned off the public.  Palin’s approval rating is now at an all-time low, with &lt;a

They compiled the list by counting the number of times that a scientist was mentioned in books published since 1800. The standard is Charles Darwin whose citations are set at 1000 milliDarwins. The only one who ranked higher was Bertrand Russell at 1500 milliDarwins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the top 25. The ones on the bottom have scores of 152. One remarkable thing about this list is how few of them are really famous for doing science. Many of them are cited in popular books for other reasons. Another remarkable thing about the list is that all of the scientists in the top 25 are dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) (1500mD)   &lt;br&gt;Charles Darwin (1809-1882) (1000mD)   &lt;br&gt;Albert Einstein (1879-1955)  (878mD)&lt;br&gt;Lewis Carroll (1832-1898)  (479mD)   &lt;br&gt;Claude Bernard (1813-1878)  (429mD)&lt;br&gt;Oliver Lodge (1851-1940)  (394mD)   &lt;br&gt;Julian Huxley (1887-1975)  (350mD)&lt;br&gt;Karl Pearson (1857-1936)  (346mD)&lt;br&gt;Niels Bohr (1885-1962)  (289mD)&lt;br&gt;Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922)  (274mD)&lt;br&gt;Max Planck (1858-1947)  (256mD)&lt;br&gt;Francis Galton (1822-1911)  (255mD)&lt;br&gt;Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) (252mD)&lt;br&gt;Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) (237mD)&lt;br&gt;Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952) (236mD)&lt;br&gt;Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947)  (229mD)&lt;br&gt;Marie Curie (1867-1934) (189mD)&lt;br&gt;Robert Koch (1843-1910) (185mD)&lt;br&gt;Isaac Asimov (1920-1992)  (183mD)&lt;br&gt;James Jeans (1877-1946) (182mD)&lt;br&gt;Ray Lankester (1847-1929)  (175mD)  &lt;br&gt;Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002)  (169mD)&lt;br&gt;Norbert Wiener (1894-1964)  (163mD)   &lt;br&gt;Rachel Carson (1907-1964)  (152mD)   &lt;br&gt;Carl Sagan (1934-1996)  (152mD)&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;The website has an interactive table that links you to Wikipedia articles.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It was never my intension to disenfranchise anyone”, Bentley said. “If I did make anyone of any faith feel disenfranchised, let me say I am sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did not mean to offend anyone with my comments there,” Bentley said to a group of religious leaders and reporters in his State Capitol office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The governor said when he made the comments to the church audience he assumed he was speaking as a private citizen and not as the Governor of Alabama.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked at a press conference following the meeting, if he considered those attending to be his brothers and sisters, Bentley responded “Yes, yes I do.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bentley knew damn well he was speaking to a Christian crowd using his title as governor.  He has no excuse for what he did, but in the last line in that excerpt, we already know he’s a liar.  Obviously, he doesn’t actually believe any Muslim or Jew or atheist is his brother. He said so just the other day.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad for a first act. I wonder how he’ll try to top it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his first act as Governor of Alabama, &lt;strong&gt;Robert Bentley&lt;/strong&gt; made it a point to tell Christians &lt;a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/01/new_alabama_governor_only_christians_are_my_brothe.php?ref=fpa"&gt;he considered them family&lt;/a&gt;.  Nice to see him showing love for the Jews, Muslims, and atheists in his state…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… &lt;strong&gt;Bentley then said that only those who are Christians and “saved” like he is are his brothers and sisters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There may be some people here today who do not have living within them the Holy Spirit,” Bentley said. ”But if you have been adopted in God’s family like I have, and like you have if you’re a Christian and if you’re saved, and the Holy Spirit lives within you just like the Holy Spirit lives within me, then you know what that makes? It makes you and me brothers. And it makes you and me brother and sister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bentley stopped just short of calling for non-Christians to accept Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”Now I will have to say that, if we don’t have the same daddy, we’re not brothers and sisters,” he said. “So anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, I’m telling you, you’re not my brother and you’re not my sister, and I want to be your brother.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No thank you.  Jokes about Alabama citizens having the “same daddy” aside, I have no desire to be a part of a family like that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even worse is that the beginning of Bentley’s speech was &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0111/Colorblind_among_Christians.html?showall"&gt;all about inclusion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I was elected as a Republican candidate. But once I became governor … I became the governor of all the people. I intend to live up to that. I am color blind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the shout-out to Christians, it’s clear which group he favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase &lt;strong&gt;George Orwell&lt;/strong&gt;: All people are equal; some are just more equal than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blair Scott&lt;/strong&gt;, former Alabama State Director of American Atheists, &lt;a href="http://atheists.org/blog/2011/01/18/alabama-governor-insinuates-non-christians-are-second-class-citizens"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bentley may not have intended to insult non-Christians in Alabama, but he did. And Bentley’s view that only Christians are his “brothers and sisters” relegates non-Christians in Alabama to a second class citizen state in his mind. How can we trust Bentley now when he has to choose between two competing bids for a state contract and one is owned by a Christian and the other a Hindu, Wiccan, Buddhist, Muslim, or atheist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bentley said he wasn’t trying to insult anybody. That is not good enough for me. I want to know that he will actually treat all of Alabama’s citizens equally and that he is truly sorry for making non-Christians in Alabama feel like second class citizens.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect Bentley’s sort of exclusionary preaching in a church, but as a governor, you leave your preaching hat at the door.  Who advised him, in his first act, to alienate every non-Christians in his state?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And besides just speaking in Christianese, what does that statement even mean?  Why would anyone want to be in a “family” with &lt;strong&gt;James Dobson&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Falwell&lt;/strong&gt;?    If you asked me to pick families I’d like to be a part of, their names would not be on the top of my list…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun with this guy, Alabama.  Remember that you’re not part of his family when he comes asking you for money.&lt;br&gt;

The diagnosis would certainly come as no surprise to anyone who has spent time around him. He talks without interruption from 7:00 in the morning until he falls asleep at 10:00 p.m.. He runs any child he plays with into the ground as they beg him to slow down. He loves school and does well but spends nearly the entire day standing up as he is unable to stay in a seat for any length of time. He often has no control over his body, which seems to be driven by some outside force. He is outgoing, kind, and likable, but often "wears out his welcome" as his impulsivity and limitless energy exhaust those around him. It’s probably this same ADHD that has given him the adventurous spirit, unflinching enthusiasm for new experiences, and exceptional resourcefulness that are his hallmarks. These traits, combined with his good nature, have allowed him to thrive in most social and educational environments—but that is becoming harder for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has been a great challenge to parent, a major source of stress, and left us exhausted and frustrated. It is only recently though, with the increasing severity of his symptoms, that it has begun to profoundly affect his quality of life. He cannot control his impulses in the very situations he loves most, and worst of all, is beginning to become aware of the effects his hyperactivity are having on others and feeling deep remorse for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, while ADHD can’t be cured, there are many treatment options that can lead to successful management. We familiarized ourselves with the options, read into the available research (as well as non-medical professionals can) and looked to the expertise of our pediatrician to choose a treatment. We are trying a combination of medication and behavioral modification. While not “magic bullets," there are a number of medication options that have high success rates, limited side-effects, and often significantly improve the lives of those with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am enthusiastic but at the same time bothered by the thought of the many kids (and adults) that won’t have access to the same safe and often effective treatment options. This is because of the ill-informed, irresponsible, and delusional demonization of ADHD medications that is spread by self-proclaimed experts with no medical knowledge, and usually an axe to grind or an alternative to sell. You will find that the anti-ADHD medication crowd runs in the same circles where we find anti-vaccination types. Their claims are anti-scientific, loaded with manipulative language, often ideological, and unsupported by legitimate research. That isn’t stopping them from getting to concerned parents who are trying to navigate the sea of conflicting claims while they try to make the correct decision for their child. As a parent, being told a treatment is dangerous, toxic, ineffective, life-destroying, addiction-causing, untested, or “zombifying,” will make you pause. Hearing it thirty times will cause you to look past the mountains of good science and your better judgement, and to the false promises, unproven claims, and outright frauds that are the bedfellows of those attacking ADHD medication without evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google search for ADHD treatments will return many useful resources including leading institutions committed to providing the most reliable information available on the subject like &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/treatment.html"&gt;The Centers For Disease Control.&lt;/a&gt;  It will also return 30 sites out of the first 100 that make claims relating to treatments that have no scientific support whatsoever. Many of the sites intentionally use language that shows complete disregard for the truth or meaningful debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the CDC and AAP provide exhaustive evidence-based reviews of treatment options, websites right next to them in the search results will feature absurd fear-inspiring statements like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On a physical level, the recommended drugs are  toxic, and they have a long list of deleterious effects.1 Regarding  Ritalin, the fact is that "methylphenidate looks like an amphetamine  (chemically), acts like an amphetamine (effects), and is abused like an  amphetamine (recreational use, Emergency Room visits, pharmacy  break-ins)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacy break-ins as a side effect? Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Ritalin produces two especially harmful effects. It deprives a child of the right to develop a character and a way of living with self and world"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The 700 percent rise in Ritalin use is our canary in the mineshaft for the middle class, warning us that we aren't meeting the needs of all our children, not just those with ADD. It's time we rethought our priorities and expectations unless we want a nation of kids running on Ritalin"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Increasingly over the past ten years or so, millions of parents are nagged by their children's physicians: "If your child had diabetes," the doctors taunt, for example, "you'd give him insulin wouldn't you?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;"98% of people with ADHD will NEVER see significant and lasting changes by following the "conventional" routes of treating ADD and ADHD"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Your doctor just wants to pump him full of drugs. He dismisses diet as a treatment of ADHD when you ask what foods are not good if you have ADHD".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The juggernaut of mental or behavioral labeling and biopsychiatric drugging"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing in these statements is backed up by any credible evidence or useful in making a choice. Most are just acting to advance some anti-mainstream medicine agenda. That doesn’t mean they don’t effect people’s decisions. This is just a tiny sample quickly grabbed from the first few of the many prominent websites spreading this misinformation. They usually go on to promote alternative treatments that are equally inaccurate and often outright scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t take any position on whether or not parents choose to medicate their children. My intent is not to promote one treatment over another. I will leave that to the medical community and the findings of science. I am just sickened by those who freely distribute information they are not qualified to give and intentionally do so in a way that manipulates those who listen. It is particularly troubling when they bear no cost for disguising themselves as experts and making it difficult for people to make informed decisions that could have profound impacts on their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location for Sunday sessions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Morris Area Elentary School Concert Hall&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Location for Monday sessions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hosanna Worship Center&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
46303 State Hwy 28&lt;br&gt;
Morris, MN&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This event is a combined ministry of &lt;br&gt;
The Morris Evangelical Free Church&lt;br&gt;
Hosanna Worship Center&lt;br&gt;
Morris Community Church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s nice to see the centers of indoctrination into religious stupidity — the &lt;a href="http://www.mefc.net/index.php"&gt;Morris Evangelical Free Church&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.hosannaworshipcenter.org/"&gt;Hosanna Worship Center&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://morrischurch.com/"&gt;Morris Community Church&lt;/a&gt; — boldly standing up to admit their participation in crimes against reason. And now you know the kind of folly we face here in rural Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/oh_look_what_will_be_happening.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Y-ARe5r6nfE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295450727312"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/a_wakefield_poll.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ccf6065c8a02ca7f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">A Wakefield poll</title><published>2011-01-19T15:04:49Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T15:04:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/SmIxph1-1y4/a_wakefield_poll.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/a_wakefield_poll.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As all rational, well-informed people know, Andrew Wakefield has been thoroughly discredited: his poor study that claimed a link between vaccination and autism has not only been debunked, but Wakefield has been found to have committed fraud for personal profit, manipulating the data to get the results that professional litigators wanted him to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t you know it, Wakefield is fighting back…by trying to crash an internet poll. Doesn&amp;#39;t he know that the Jedi Masters of poll crashing are all either on the side of science (like me) or the side of chaos (4chan), and that he&amp;#39;s not going to get his way with that approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2011/01/a_wakefield_poll/wakefield.jpeg" width="465" height="720" alt="wakefield.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a silly question. I don't think it was a figment of his imagination at all; I think he saw dollar signs being waved by lawyers and intentionally fudged his data to make them happy. I'd think better of him if he &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; a delusional incompetent, but instead, I now think he was a con artist who traded children's lives for payola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the poll in question. I trust you will act responsibly and destroy it savagely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/opinionzone/2011/01/14/vaccine-autism-link-proved-false/"&gt;Is the vaccine-autism link debunked?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes 57.24% &lt;br&gt;
 
No 42.76%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a masochist, you might enjoy reading the comments at that link. Wakefield&amp;#39;s True Believers™ are out in force there, making amazing paranoid accusations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/a_wakefield_poll.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/SmIxph1-1y4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295449518574"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9903">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0922a511044ea7df</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Herbs &amp; Supplements"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="joseph mercola"/><category term="Mehmet Oz"/><category term="Oprah Winfrey"/><category term="quackery"/><category term="supplements"/><category term="The Dr. Oz Show"/><title type="html">For shame, Dr. Oz, for promoting Joseph Mercola on your show!</title><published>2011-01-19T15:00:51Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T15:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9903" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been highly critical of Dr. Mehmet Oz, &lt;a href="http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/facdb/profile_list.asp?uni=mco2&amp;amp;DepAffil=Surgery"&gt;Vice Chair of the Department of Surgery at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and medical director of the Integrative Medicine Program (i.e., Columbia’s quackademic medicine) program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Those are his academic titles. More important, in terms of his promotion of pseudoscience, is his role as daytime medical show host. Dr. Oz’s television show, called, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/"&gt;The Dr. Oz Show&lt;/a&gt;, is a direct result of his having been featured on Oprah Winfrey’s show on numerous occasions as one of her regular medical experts. Because of his popularity, Dr. Oz became Oprah’s protégé and ultimately scored his very own daytime TV show, which has been quite successful since its debut in September 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what has led me to conclude that I’ve finally completely had it with Dr. Oz? Or, as Popeye would say, “I’ve had all I can stands, I can’t stands no more!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final straw occurred yesterday, but this has been building up for a while. Of course, I’ve known for a long time that Dr. Oz has a weak spot for “alternative medicine.” A decade ago, he was known for bringing &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; masters into the operating room do their mystical magical gestures during cardiac surgery, the better to channel the healing energy of the “universal source” into his patients before they went onto the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. His wife is &lt;a href="http://womenofgrace.com/newage/?p=477"&gt;also a &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; master&lt;/a&gt;, which might explain his particular fondness for this form of faith healing. Even so, even though I always knew Dr. Oz was into &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; woo, most of the times I ever saw him on Oprah’s show and the rare occasion that I’ve seen his show, the worst I could say about him was that he is at best a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggie&lt;/a&gt; and at worst too prone to mixing perfectly valid, science-based information with the “softer” forms of “complementary and alternative” medicine (CAM) modalities, such as acupuncture and reiki. Even so, CAM didn’t seem to be a major part of his show. That seems to have changed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2010 dawned, I became aware of a show in which Dr. Oz promoted &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt; completely uncritically, beginning the year with a show entitled &lt;a href="http://watch.ctv.ca/the-dr-oz-show/season-1/the-dr-oz-show-01-06-10-dr-ozs-ultimate-alternative-medicine-secrets/#clip252328"&gt;Dr. Oz’s Ultimate Alternative Medicine Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t too long before Dr. Oz did it again, delivering a two-fer of “quantum” quackery coupled with just plain quackery, when he invited Deepak Chopra and Joe Mercola on his show. Around the same time, Dr. Oz also revealed in an interview also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/01/regarding_dr_mehmet_oz_whoops_maybe_i_sp.php"&gt;hadn’t had his children vaccinated against H1N1&lt;/a&gt;. In all fairness, he seemed embarrassed to admit this and uncomfortable about the situation (Dr. Oz has never, to my knowledge, expressed anti-vaccine views), but, even so, he did seem to be more sympathetic than the evidence warrants to the concept that vaccines might somehow cause autism. None of these occurrences was good, but, as disturbing as they were, none of them quite crossed a line. Quite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2011 dawns, there is no doubt in my mind that Dr. Oz has now irrevocably &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Rubicon_(disambiguation)"&gt;crossed his Woo-bicon&lt;/a&gt; (link there to make my pun painfully obvious), gone over to the Dark Side, betrayed the cause, gone woo, or whatever you want to call it. He’s done, as far as science-based medicine goes. That’s because yesterday he featured one of the biggest promoters of highly dubious medical remedies on the Internet on his show in one fawning segment after another. I’m referring, of course, to &lt;a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Joe Mercola&lt;/a&gt;, who was the main guest on The Dr. Oz Show yesterday in segments entitled &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-1"&gt;The Alternative Health Controversy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-1"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-2"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-3"&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;), coupled with another segment entitled &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/surprising-supplement-you-need"&gt;The Surprising Supplement You Need&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s just say that Dr. Oz’s journey to the Dark Side is now complete. He has controlled his fear but released his woo, and it is strong woo indeed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To give you an idea of just how bad this is, take a look at the introduction to the show before the credits. Dr. Mercola is described as a “pioneer in alternative medicine” and “a man your doctor doesn’t want you to know.” I don’t know about you, but hearing that made me think instantly of Kevin Trudeau and his now-infamous book of quackery &lt;em&gt;Natural Cures “They” Don’t Want You To Know About&lt;/em&gt;. I also can’t help but note that when a good, science-based doctor doesn’t want you to listen to someone, there’s usually a darned good reason, and Dr. Mercola has given us a plethora of fantastic reasons to try to counter his influence over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the show opens, Dr. Oz is strikingly defiant right out of the box when he introduces the segment in which he interviews Joe Mercola. Describing Mercola as a “pioneer of holistic treatments” and a “lightning rod” (without noting that it’s not good to be a “lightning rod” when the criticisms that make you one are more than justified), Dr. Oz says that plenty of his fellow doctors are going to be angry at him for having invited Mercola back. I don’t know about angry, but my opinion of Dr. Oz has hit an all-time low over this. On second thought, yes I am angry. Dr. Oz has one of the ultimate bully pulpits, with a viewership of millions who take what he says very seriously, and by fawning over Mercola on his show, he has just abused that pulpit to promote unscientific medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly nauseating is the taped segment that follows, which lionizes Dr. Mercola as someone who has made a career out of “challenging everything you think you know about traditional medicine and prescription drugs.” I suppose that’s true in a rather trivial sense in that Mercola has been well known to promote all manner of crank medical science, whether it be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/a_fungus_among_us_in_oncology.php"&gt;Tullio Simoncini’s cancer quackery&lt;/a&gt; (which claims cancer is a fungus and that the cure is baking soda); his teaming up with Barbara Loe Fisher to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=7669"&gt;promote anti-vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt; in November, which is is of a piece with his &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2116"&gt;promotion of anti-vaccine misinformation on his website&lt;/a&gt;; his belief in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/06/mercola_and_raw_milk_faddism_invade_huff.php"&gt;raw milk faddism&lt;/a&gt;; and even his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/12/mercola_sells_the_delusion_of_homeopathy.php"&gt;selling of homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose that is “challenging everything you think you know about traditional medicine and prescription drugs,” but it’s a challenge built largely on either pseudoscience, co-opting preliminary studies that support supplements that Mercola believes in, or fear mongering and exaggeration about studies that raise legitimate concerns about “conventional” medicine. Together, it’s a toxic brew, and Dr. Oz drinks deeply of the Kool Aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give you an idea of what I mean, here’s &lt;a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/08/05/fungus-causing-cancer-a-novel-approach-to-the-most-common-form-of-death.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercola’s article&lt;/a&gt; describing Tullio Simoncini, the man who came up with the idea that cancer is a fungus and that baking soda is the cure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Dr. Simoncini is yet another brilliant doctor who has been ousted from the medical community due to his revolutionary simple ideas of how to cure profit-making diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people refuse to believe that this is true and that it’s happening to good doctors, since “everyone knows” you must be a liability to human life if you’re stripped of your medical license.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason why Dr. Simoncini was kicked out is because as an oncologist – a cancer specialist — he refused to use conventional cancer treatment methods, choosing instead to administer sodium bicarbonate, which is HARMLESS, as opposed to the often lethal use of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simoncini is from my perspective a &lt;a href="http://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2009/11/21/career-boost-for-tllio-simoncini/"&gt;dangerous quack&lt;/a&gt; who claims that injecting sodium bicarbonate directly into tumors can cure them. Indeed, he has &lt;a href="http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/maggio/21/Medico_condannato_omicidio_colposo_co_10_060521029.shtml"&gt;had his medical license removed in Italy&lt;/a&gt; for fraud and patient deaths and has been under investigation in the Netherlands, where he now has a clinic. A blogger who has combed Italian websites for information on Simoncini &lt;a href="http://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/be-wary-of-simoncini-cancer-treatment-therapy/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because one of us (SJJ) is fluent in Italian, we could extensively search Italian Web sites for information on Simoncini’s background. Currently living in Rome, he has been using unsubstantiated cancer treatments for 15 years. He calls himself a specialist in diabetes and metabolic diseases, but in 2003, his license to practice medicine was withdrawn, and in 2006 he was convicted by an Italian judge for wrongful death and swindling. This has not stopped him from continuing to provide his controversial treatments, not only in Italy, but apparently also in foreign countries, such as the Netherlands. He has appealed his conviction, but we could not find information on the status of this appeal on Italian Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples abound. In &lt;a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/05/10/the-kanzius-machine-a-cancer-cure.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, Mercola promotes quacks like Hulda Clark (who promoted the idea that all cancer is due to a liver fluke), Raymond Rife, and Ryke Geerd Hamer (creator of the quackery known as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1993"&gt;German New Medicine&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, there is no “alternative” health claim so preposterous, so utterly dubious, so dangerous, that Mercola will not support it. Peruse Mercola’s website, and it won’t take you very long to find health information that is pure pseudoscience. He &lt;a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/12/03/cancer-not-found-in-ancient-mummies-appears-to-be-recent-disease.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;even fell for a dubious study&lt;/a&gt; that claimed that, because investigators couldn’t find cancer in Egyptian mummies, cancer didn’t exist back then and is therefore a “man-made” disease.One depressing tidbit of information, if it’s true, is that Dr. Mercola’s website is the fourth largest health website on the Internet. If that doesn’t show how bad health information on the Internet is, I don’t know what does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, Mercola is portrayed as having alerted the world to the importance of vitamin D and the “dangers of high fructose corn syrup” (which is &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6501"&gt;not nearly as dangerous as Mercola would have you believe&lt;/a&gt;). In reality, appreciating the importance of vitamin D has come out of medical science, not Dr. Mercola, and in actuality the science behind the role of vitamin D is in evolution. What Dr. Mercola is most responsible for, along with Mike Adams, is promoting vitamin D as some &lt;a href="http://vitamind.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;sort of miracle supplement&lt;/a&gt; that will prevent heart disease, cancer, and aging. His “alerting the world” about HFCS consists mainly of overblown fear mongering that &lt;a href="http://search.mercola.com/Results.aspx?q=high%20fructose%20corn%20syrup&amp;amp;k=high%20fructose%20corn%20syrup" rel="nofollow"&gt;blames HFCS for virtually all modern human health problems&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the very antithesis of a reasoned weighing of risks versus benefits based on science. Worse, right out of the box, Mercola spouts his same old nonsense in which he represents himself as a bastion against the evil pharmaceutical companies, a champion of the concept that “we can take control of our health” using “natural lifestyle approaches,” castigating medicine as “treating only the symptoms.” Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://Products.mercola.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercola’s online store&lt;/a&gt; is a cornucopia of unproven, dubious, and outright nonsensical health products, including &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/Supplements-c8.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/Supplements_Herbal+Supplements-dl172-cat8.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;herbal remedies&lt;/a&gt;, and DVDs covering all manner of woo, such as &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/DVDs-The_Tapping_Solution_DVD-P1632.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;meridian tapping&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/DVDs-Prescription_For_Disaster__Gary_Null_DVD-P503.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gary Null DVD&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/DVDs-NVIC_4th_Int_l_Public_Conference_on_Vaccination_DVD-P1678.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;DVD of the anti-vaccine group NVIC’s conference&lt;/a&gt; from last year (blogged &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1723" rel="nofollow"&gt;Living Matrix DVD&lt;/a&gt; (blogged &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=5498"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by Harriet), a &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/DVDs-Food_Matters_DVD-P1361.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;DVD promoting raw “living” food veganism&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://shop.mercola.com/DVDs-Sweet_Remedy_DVD-P603.aspx" rel="nofollow"&gt;DVD claiming to cure multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; by “eliminating toxins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, Dr. Oz asks Dr. Mercola, “What makes people so angry at you?” Dr. Mercola then invokes his criticisms of Vioxx (of all things) and then cites Arthur Schopenhauer’s famous saying, “All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.” I’ve always hated this saying because it’s so trite, and it’s not even true. But even if Schopenhauer’s maxim were true, untruth would never make it to the third stage. That’s why purveyors of pseudoscience, like Dr. Mercola, never make it to the third stage as much as they desperately want to. So they reassure themselves when they get stuck at the stage of opposition or justly deserved ridicule that it’s all because they are promoting a “truth” that is so threatening and tell themselves that it’s only a matter of time before they reach Schopenhauer’s third stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse. Dr. Oz even goes so far as to describe modern medicine as being in a “civil war,” which makes me wonder if the criticism of his embrace of pseudoscience is starting to get to him. Be that as it may, Dr. Oz claims that he wants to “get the two sides talking to each other.” In all fairness, I will say that Dr. Oz does get some minor points for citing criticism of Dr. Mercola as a supplement hawker who is no different from pharmaceutical companies in that he says what he needs to say to sell a product. Actually, that’s a spot-on description of Mercola. That’s exactly what he is–a salesman–who will say whatever it takes to sell his product. True, the best salesmen actually believe in the products they’re selling, but that doesn’t excuse Mercola if he does believe in his products (I’m not always sure that he does) or excuse him for peddling medical pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercola’s reply is priceless and sad. First, he says that he sells only “natural” products, as if that matters one whit to the accusation of his having a massive conflict of interest every bit as bad as that of any pharmaceutical company. It’s completely irrelevant. Second, Mercola states that he didn’t sell anything the first three years of his website’s existence, as though that mattered at all either. His excuse? Publishing his newsletter and keeping his website going was costing him a half a million dollars a year, leaving him the choice of selling things he “believes in” or selling advertising. To me, that means he needed money to run his website, and if he didn’t sell products his website would be defunct. That’s a pretty strong motivation to keep the products flowing out to the credulous masses, all at a hefty markup, of course. Then, Mercola states that no one has ever died taking his supplements, as though that matters when it comes to his massive conflict of interest. Actually, Mercola has no way of knowing that no one has ever died taking his supplement. More importantly, I do know that at least one person has died as a result of quackery featured on Mercola’s website, namely &lt;a href="http://anaximperator.wordpress.com/2008/11/12/sylvia-dies/"&gt;a woman who died after Tullio Simoncini tried to treat her breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; by injecting it with baking soda, as described here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to her partner, Simoncini flew to the Netherlands and started treating Sylvia with intratumoral sodium bicarbonate injections, with the help of an assistant. Sylvia received up to 20 injections in her breast tumor. Shortly thereafter she became sick and in a nearly dead state was towed out of her appartment by the fire department and presented at the first aid department of the Free University Medical Center of Amsterdam. There she died of metabolic alkalosis related disease soon after. The attending internist refused to sign the documents for a natural death and contacted the police. An autopsy revealed that Sylvia did not die of breast cancer. She had several injection spots on her blue and swollen mutilated breast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt Mercola would deny that he has any culpability whatsoever, but, by credulously posting Simoncini’s praises, in my opinion he is promoting dangerous quackery that kills. Finally, Mercola then goes on and on about how he promotes “healthy natural supplements.” Dr. Oz eats this up, playing the world’s weakest “skeptic” by saying that he “doesn’t always agree” with Dr. Mercola. That’s just a prelude to Dr. Oz planting his lips firmly against Dr. Mercola’s anus by calling him “so far ahead of us” and asking him where he finds out all this wonderful information that he provides. If there is one brief moment that is the most nauseating of all, that most characterizes Dr. Oz’s fall from grace. He doesn’t challenge any of Mercola’s assertions, either with science or even with enough skepticism to ask Mercola to show him some evidence to support his claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercola then goes on to hawk coconut oil as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Personally, I was curious; so I did a PubMed search. Actually, I did quite a few PubMed searches, and I had a hell of a time finding anything linking the use of coconut oil to the treatment of any form of dementia rather than just Alzheimer’s. Maybe I didn’t get the right search terms; so I tried Google Scholar as well. I found a &lt;a href="http://www.jlr.org/content/45/6/1112.short"&gt;few animal studies&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s about it. Oddly enough, although there are quite a few articles about coconut oil on &lt;a href="http://search.mercola.com/Results.aspx?q=coconut%20oil&amp;amp;k=coconut%20oil" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mercola’s website&lt;/a&gt;, but almost nothing that even mentions using coconut oil for treating Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia and only three references looking at medium chain triglycerides as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Now, &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;‘s some &lt;a href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2229"&gt;seriously thin evidence&lt;/a&gt;. So I went to the almighty Google, and what I found are a lot of CAM websites touting coconut oil as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, such as &lt;a href="http://www.earthclinic.com/Remedies/coconut_oil.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The concept seems to come from a physician named Dr. Mary Newport, who claims that her husband suffering from Alzheimer’s &lt;a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/aging/article879333.ece"&gt;improved after the addition of coconut oil to his diet&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at this claim in more detail might make a good topic for a future post, but I must say that I wasn’t too impressed with what I could find. It’s hard to believe that Dr. Oz or his staff never bothered to look for the studies supporting the use of coconut oil for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. If that had been done, it would have been rapidly apparent how thin that evidence was. One of the other supplements Mercola and Oz promoted was L-arginine. Again, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/nobel_prize_predictions_vindicated.php"&gt;evidence isn’t too persuasive&lt;/a&gt; supporting the claims for that one, either, even if a Nobel Laureate is out there &lt;a href="http://abelpharmboy.wordpress.com/2007/04/19/multilevel_dietary_supplement/"&gt;hawking it as a supplement for Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/surprising-supplement-you-need"&gt;final segment of Mercola’s appearance&lt;/a&gt;, Mercola promotes a supplement I had never heard of before, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=The+Most+Powerful+Nutrient+for+Eye+Health+site%3Amercola.com&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;safe=images&amp;amp;tbs=#sclient=psy&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=astaxanthin+site:mercola.com&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;fp=ee5b8d49ec6ea034"&gt;astaxanthin&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, there isn’t that much on Mercola’s website about it, although PubMed actually does have some interesting review articles on it. There actually is some evidence that astaxanthin might well have beneficial effects on &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656058"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; and other aspects of health. However, to date most studies are either cell culture or animal studies, with several smaller clinical trials. In other words, touting astaxanthin as some sort of miracle supplement–and, make no mistake, that is exactly what Mercola does (watch for yourself if you don’t believe me)–is irresponsible and premature. The evidence just isn’t robust enough to recommend it to the general population. Not that any of this stops Dr. Oz from giving Mercola a platform or Mercola from taking full advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oz ends this segment by addressing Dr. Mercola:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re a lightning rod for controversy. I’m glad you’re on the show today, and I asked Dr. Mercola to be on the show today because you forced me, as you force all physicians, to think critically about what we’re offering you [faces the audience] as advice. And the alternatives you [faces Mercola] talk to us about and the questions that you force us to ask allow us to reevaluate what we’re doing, which helps you [faces the audience again] get get more truthful information. I thank you [faces Mercola] for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercola forces all physicians to think critically? “Think critically.” You keep using that phrase. I do not think it means what you think it means. Dr. Oz clearly needs to disimpact his nose from Dr. Mercola’s nether regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no excuse for this. Dr. Oz, by featuring a noted supporter of dubious medicine as influential as Dr. Mercola, has done his viewers–no, science-based medicine itself–a grave disservice. Worse, not only is Dr. Oz not skeptical of Mercola; he embraces him, with only a few minor quibbles where “I don’t always agree with you.” Add to that Dr. Oz’s enthusiastic promotion of the fallacy of the golden mean, in which he argues that optimal health care would be achieved by somehow melding woo with scientific medicine (or, as promoters of quackademic medicine like to put it, “integrating” CAM with science-based medicine–or, as I like to put it, “integrating” quackery with medicine), plus his explicitly treating Mercola’s pseudoscience as being an equal of science-based medicine worthy of a “dialogue” to meld the two, Dr. Oz’s show can only be described as having utterly destroyed what little shred of credibility that Dr. Oz had left. In his quest to conquer television and become “America’s doctor,” it’s clear that Dr. Oz has left behind his scientific integrity. It’s hard not to liken this to the proverbial deal with the devil for his very soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced? Then &lt;a href="http://pathtofaith.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;check this out&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dr. Oz Show was set to air a special show featuring Dr. Issam Nemeh and two of his patients who experienced miraculous healings on January 11, 2011. Due to the recent congressional shooting, the episode has been rescheduled for February 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Nemeh is a &lt;a href="http://pathtofaith.com/events.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;faith healer&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s good enough for Oprah, I guess it’s good enough for Dr. Oz. The only difference is that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=8349"&gt;Oprah gets John of God&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. Oz has to go to the second or third tier of faith healers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oz, you’ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&lt;/p&gt;

But Pinker was probably right when he wrote: “I suspect music is auditory cheesecake, an exquisite confection crafted to tickle the sensitive spots of...our mental faculties.” Or, to express his idea less graphically: music affects our brains at specific places, thereby stimulating the production of unique substances that have a pleasurable effect on our mood. However, rather than a by-product of evolution, music or more precisely musicality is likely to be a characteristic that survived natural selection in order to stimulate and develop our mental faculties (cf. Honing, 2011).Pinker’s idea may actually be a very fruitful hypothesis whose significance has wrongfully gone unacknowledged because of all the criticism it elicited. After all, the purely evolutionary explanations for the origins of music largely overlook the experience of music we all share: the pleasure we derive from it, not only from the acrobatics of making it but also from the act of listening to it.In a recent study Canadian researchers were able to show precisely that: Music can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. They were able to show that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. And, more importantly, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself.

This week should be viewed an update to that.

Already in 2003 Hendricks and Singhal showed in an article the devastating effects supply chain glitches can have on the shareholder value. Up to that time a strong correlation between excellence in supply chain management and shareholder value has always been presumed. Many have alluded to the compelling bottom-line benefits and tremendous payoffs that accrue to firms from developing effective supply chains, but hard evidence to support this has been very limited.

Metrics

Supply chain glitches are found by browsing through press releases in search for announcements of a demand / supply mismatch.

Increases or decreases in the shareholder value are assessed using the stock price of the company. Continue reading "Supply Chain Disruptions and Shareholder Wealth"...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mouth-to-mouth kiss that we recognize is definitely not the  only universal style of kissing. Charles Darwin wrote about this: He  suspected that if you talk about kissing in terms of touching the lips  to any body part, and even behaviors like licking and blowing, then it’s  probably a universal practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, many cultures around the world didn’t mouth-to-mouth  kiss. It was probably not the same experience before there was  mouthwash [laughs]. I went into all these historical accounts written in  the 1800s, mostly by European explorers. There’s this great anecdote  where an explorer goes to Africa and falls in love with the daughter of  an African king, and one night he’s brave enough to kiss her. She reacts  by screaming and running from the room. He realizes later that she  thought he was planning to eat her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lindsay St. Claire, Robert C. Hayward and Peter J. Rogers attempted to answer that question in a new study, which is summarized here by the BPS Research Digest: "For two men collaborating or negotiating under stressful circumstances, caffeine consumption was bad news, undermining their performance and confidence. By contrast, for pairs of women, drinking caffeine often had a beneficial effect on these same factors. The researchers can't be sure, but they think the differential effect of caffeine on men and women may have to do with the fact that women tend to respond to stress in a collaborative, mutually protective style (known as 'tend and befriend') whereas men usually exhibit a fight or flight response."&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/5wQZt7zq8jQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By FREAKONOMICS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295447276274"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=26782">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b5a3b1f96c73fa7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="religion"/><title type="html">The smoking gun</title><published>2011-01-19T14:27:45Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T14:27:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/the-smoking-gun/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I mentioned the discovery of a “smoking gun” in the Catholic Church’s abuse scandal: a 1997 letter to Ireland’s bishops from the late Archbishop Luciano Storero, described as “Pope John Paul II’s diplomat to Ireland. “  Storero’s letter instructed the bishops not to report sexual abuse cases to secular authorities, but to keep it in the Church.  Yesterday I couldn’t find the letter online, but alert reader Hempenstein did (it’s available &lt;a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/Ireland-Catholic-Abuse.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as a pdf file).  Click to enlarge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26783" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/the-smoking-gun/letter-part-1/"&gt;&lt;img title="Letter part 1" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/letter-part-1.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=634" alt="" width="500" height="634"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26784" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/the-smoking-gun/letter-part-2/"&gt;&lt;img title="Letter part 2" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/letter-part-2.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=432" alt="" width="500" height="432"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why shouldn’t the bishops report abuse to Irish authorities? The real reason, of course, is because it’s terribly damaging to the Church and its authority.  But the letter says this: “The text, however, contains ‘procedures and dispositions which appear contrary to canonical discipline and which, if applied, could invalidate the acts of the same Bishops who are attempting to put a stop to these problems. If such procedures were to be followed by the Bishops and there were cases of eventual hierarchical recourse lodged at the Holy See, the results could be highly embarrassing and detrimental to those same Diocesan authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation:  Don’t report child abuse to nonreligious authorities because it might result in your being embarrassed at the Vatican; and it could even hurt your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use Sam Harris’s moral calculus here, the Vatican is weighing the well-being of abused children against potential embarrassment and career damage to priests and bishops, and the Holy See decided that the scales weigh heavier for the latter.  And that’s immoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me is that both Catholic and accommodationist bloggers (at least the ones I read—excluding Andrew Sullivan), often the first to decry discrimination against women and minorities, are strangely silent on what the Church has done to children, and on how the cover-up reaches to the highest level of the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;

A parent brings in their child because they pulled on their arm, and now the child is not using it. Parents are thoroughly convinced that the child's arm is either broken or dislocated. We all recognize this as radial head subluxation or "nursemaid's elbow" and immediately attempt to reduce it. The provider takes the injured arm, supinates at the wrist and flexes at the elbow. Does the child scream? Does the parent scream and threaten to sue? What if nothing happens?Trick of the Trade: Hyperpronation techniqueA 2009 paper by Bek et al. describes a method of pronation instead of supination. The proposed maneuver involves one hand holding the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion and the other hand holding the wrist. The wrist is then hyperpronated to complete the reduction.Sixty-six patients were randomized to either a traditional reduction or the hyperpronation maneuver. If the initial attempt failed, a second attempt was performed. If the second attempt failed, then the alternate method was performed. Bottom line...hyperpronation was 94% successful on the first attempt compared to supination-flexion at 69%. Three patients failed supination-flexion (first and second attempt) but were successfully reduced with hyperpronation on the first attempt. Hyperpronation was also subjectively rated as significantly easier then supination-flexion by the practitioner.I've been using hyperpronation for the past several years and love it. The maneuver appears less traumatic on the child (and parent).Has anyone else tried it? I'd love to hear your experiences!ReferenceBek D et al.

Now that &lt;a href="http://www.premiereradio.com/shows/view/Dr_Dean_Edell.html"&gt;Dr. Dean Edell&lt;/a&gt; has retired (unfortunately) from his radio show, it is probable that Dr. Mehmet Oz has the highest exposure of any media physician. I have never personally been a fan of Oz – a product of Oprah Winfrey, he has always mixed reasonable medical advice with promotion of dubious alternative health care. Harsh critics of Oz have charged him with selling out in order to promote his media career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of his motivations, Oz has recently gone beyond coyly flirting with pseudoscience by directly promoting Joseph Mercola – a notorious internet doctor who himself promotes all sorts of pseudoscience and fear-mongering on his website. &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-1"&gt;In an interview on his show&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Oz praises Mercola while refraining from directly mentioning any of the more controversial positions that he takes. I will discuss the interview itself below, but first some background on Mercola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercola is infamous among promoters of SBM for a number of reasons. First his website is highly monetized. While he frequently resorts to the “Big Pharma” conspiracy talk, he himself prints information on his site that supports the sales of supplements and other products. In my opinion this makes him a snake oil salesman, and everything he writes can no longer be considered objective medical advice but rather is advertising copy. I have no problem with monetizing websites to pay for bandwidth, as long as it’s within reason. But at some point you cross a fuzzy line where the website content is there to support sales, rather than the other way around – and Mercola is way past that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But far more importantly, the information on Mercola’s website is not science-based. Mercola frequently engages in rank fear-mongering – promoting every preliminary study that may suggest a possible connection as if it were a proven health risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I have been most critical of Mercola for his anti-vaccine stance. He recently joined with anti-vaccine activist Rosemary Fischer&lt;a href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=2467"&gt; to attack the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Last year he was warning his readers away from the H1N1 vaccine citing fears that it would cause an epidemic of Guillaine-Barre Syndrome (GBS). This epidemic never appeared – despite active monitoring, there were no excess cases of GBS due to the H1N1 vaccine. Mercola never bothered to correct his prior fear-mongering. He just went on to the next one – warning his readers about a connection between vaccines and narcolepsy. However this fear did not hold up to replication either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern of Mercola’s writings is clear. Any bit of information, no matter how flawed, preliminary, or tenuous, that suggests a fear about mainstream medicine he promotes as if it is a proven fact. He also follows the same pattern with any pre-clinical or preliminary evidence that suggests a possible role of any food or supplement in the prevention or treatment of a disease. In the absence of well-designed clinical trials, he happily extrapolates from this preliminary evidence to sell specific products with health claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, in my opinion Mercola is a dangerous medical crank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oz has chosen to promote Mercola as a cutting edge controversial doctor – the doctor “your doctor does not want you talking to.” Oz is taking the role of peace-maker – bringing the two sides together. This goal probably sells well to the public, as it appeals to our sensibilities of fairness and democracy, but it is ultimately anti-scientific and hopeless. You will have as much luck bringing together biologists who understand and accept evolution with creationists. There are fundamental and mutually exclusive differences in method and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Oz acts as if (whether or not he truly believes it) science-based medicine and CAM are just different traditions or approaches, both equally valid. And that is precisely why Oz, as a media doctor, is so dangerous himself – such an attitude white-washes the very real deficiencies of CAM. The interview with Mercola is a perfect example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an interviewer, Oz did a terrible job. He lofted the proverbial softballs at Mercola, and even when they suggested a criticism he only provided Mercola with an opportunity to answer his critics – but then never followed up, and never hit Mercola with any examples of his pseudoscience (like those above). It was a honeymoon interview, useful for promoting Mercola but not providing insightful or useful information to his viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example he brought up Mercola’s monetizing of his website, without putting it into context. In response Mercola said that the difference between his website and “Big Pharma” is that his products are natural (which is completely irrelevant) and that his products never killed anyone (which is a bold claim that Mercola cannot possibly know). It is, in fact, highly likely that the information provided on Mercola’s website does have a body count. He has scared readers away from vaccination, a proven safe and effective preventive measure. Selling products with the claims that he does encourages some readers to rely upon unproven and likely ineffective treatments instead of proven treatments. Even in the absence of direct harm (which cannot be assumed for all products) there is the potential for tremendous indirect harm. Oz let Mercola get away with his claims with no counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of Mercola’s typical behavior, Oz let him promote on his show coconut oil to treat and prevent Alzheimer’s disease. The clinical evidence for this is nonexistent. It is based on wild extrapolation from some basic science research showing that, for example,&lt;a href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2009/02/17/db08-1557.abstract"&gt; diabetic rats who were hypoglycemic had improved cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; when fed medium chain triglycerides, because the brain can metabolize ketones. The chance that this research has any applicability to Alzheimer’s disease is so remote as to be laughable. Perhaps there might be a distant connection that will emerge from research, but the current connection is so tenuous that making clinical claims based upon this evidence is best characterized as pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the cutting edge CAM that Dr. Oz praises Mercola for. In this case, and many others, it’s not even original to Mercola – it’s just recycled nonsense from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were any doubt as to the intellectual integrity and scientific legitimacy of Dr. Oz as a media doctor, he has erased all doubt with this interview of Mercola. It was an incompetent interview from a journalistic perspective. Oz never brought up any truly useful information – anything that would have helped his viewers make an informed decision about Mercola. It was, if anything, shameless promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview also makes Dr. Oz’s intent clear – to bring together legitimate science-based medicine and the entire spectrum of nonsense, pseudoscience, and dubious practice that is loosely collected under the umbrella of CAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the Orion Nebula approximately… well, how many times? Let’s see… um, carry the two… yeah, a gazillion times. You have too, probably, since to the unaided eye it appears as a star in the dagger hanging below Orion’s famous belt&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also seen it with binoculars and through telescopes ranging in size from dimestore junkers to a one-meter on a mountaintop. And yet, every new picture of it reveals something interesting… like &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1103a/"&gt;this spectacular shot&lt;/a&gt; does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yowza. Click to ennebulanate, or get the orionormous &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/images/publicationjpg/eso1103a.jpg"&gt;4000 x 3800 version&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;First, some stats: this picture is a combination of five separate images from the red to the ultraviolet (that last colored violet, actually), including a filter that sees just the glow from warm hydrogen (colored red in this image). The telescope used was a 2.2 meter in Chile. The nebula is pretty big — the full Moon would just fit inside this image — so the detail on this is truly stunning. &lt;/p&gt;

Here is Butter, an awesomely fluffy Himalayan entered in the Big Kitteh Contest.  This is his story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found by a State Trooper near I-25 in Cheyenne, Wyoming—where he was  barely surviving on grasshoppers for at least a month—this extra furry Himalayan came to the Humane Society.  His adoption photo named him “Shnozzle”, and showed him wearing a big blue ribbon to try to make him presentable, even though he was close to death.  But we had been chosen (by the kitteh sign of a headbutt on the forehead); we brought him to Colorado, where we had to deal with the sequelae of his rough adolescence—both anal glands had to be removed due to recurrent infections, an intestinal blockage required emergency care, and his FHV infection (acquired while in contact with other cats in the shelter) mandates a lifetime of management with lysine and antibiotics to keep outbreaks under control.  The struggle for this little scrapper was worth it, as this picture demonstrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="attachment wp-att-26727" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/kitteh-contest-entry-butter/butterlounge/"&gt;&lt;img title="butterlounge" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/butterlounge.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=382" alt="" width="500" height="382"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We renamed him “Butter” not only because he loves butter and he is the color of butter, but he butts his head repeatedly to communicate (i.e., he´s a butt-er).  On bad days, he´s head-butt, butt-head, you name it.  While it is tempting to think the flat aspect of his face was due to extreme head-butting, it is actually the culmination of &lt;a href="http://www.himalayancatsonline.com/a_himihistory.shtml"&gt;an intelligent design mechanism&lt;/a&gt; that began in the 1930s and sadly continues to this day.  Due to a fondness for baby-like faces, their designers continue to breed maladaptive noses, making breathing more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve since received several more photos of Butter.  Here’s the adoption photo of “Schnozzle” that persuaded Steve and Terri to take him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are we doing this…? [&lt;em&gt;Because most Illinois politicians are idiots.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I thought forced prayer was illegal in public schools. [&lt;em&gt;Yes. Yes it is...&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mehta, can we just ignore this like we do all the other announcements?  [&lt;em&gt;Of course not. You must listen to them every day like the perfect little angels you are.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; columnist &lt;strong&gt;Eric Zorn&lt;/strong&gt; points out that for all the shit &lt;strong&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/strong&gt; did, at least &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/-ct-oped-0119-zorn-20110119,0,6992664.column"&gt;he got this one right&lt;/a&gt; when he vetoed the bill a few years back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The law in Illinois today already allows teachers and students the opportunity to take a moment for silent thought or prayer, if they choose to,” he said in vetoing the bill. “I believe this is the right balance between the principles echoed in our constitution, and our deeply held desire to practice our faith.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Sherman&lt;/strong&gt;, the local atheist who (with his daughter) put a stop to the Moment of Silence a few years ago — only to have the injunction lifted now — is ready to &lt;a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/2011/01/18.htm"&gt;pounce back into action&lt;/a&gt;.  And he’s bringing some help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;America’s two top atheists, &lt;a href="http://www.restorethepledge.com/live/mike_newdow/"&gt;Mike Newdow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/information/aboutrob.htm"&gt;Rob Sherman&lt;/a&gt;, are joining forces to appeal to the &lt;a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.aspx"&gt;US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; last year’s &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/pdf/MomentOfSilence/Document50.pdf"&gt;widely mocked decision&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/"&gt;Seventh Circuit US Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; that the Illinois &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Student Prayer Act&lt;/a&gt; is supposedly constitutional.  Newdow and I have challenged more violations of atheist constitutional rights than anybody else in the history of the nation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newdow will be the lead attorney on our Supreme Court appeal of the Appellate Court decision regarding the obviously unconstitutional Illinois &amp;quot;Moment of Silence&amp;quot; law.  That decision reversed &lt;a href="http://www.patheos.com/advocacy/Dawnv214/Gettleman090121.pdf"&gt;Judge Gettleman’s decision&lt;/a&gt; from the local &lt;a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/"&gt;federal District Court&lt;/a&gt; that recognized that the Student Prayer Act is, indeed, unconstitutional.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Sherman: A man who never lacks for self-esteem &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, yes, good, this is what needs to happen.  File the lawsuit and get this “silent prayer” act out of the public schools.  I applaud the move.  I only wish more people could get involved in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Illinois legislators want teachers to waste “moments” of our students’ time, I promise we can find better ways to do it than spending it in silence.&lt;br&gt;

Autobiographical or 'episodic' memory describes our ability to recall past experiences and is distinct from semantic memory, which is our factual knowledge about the world. So far so good, but according to Youssef Ezzyat and Lila Davachi, psychology has so far largely neglected to investigate exactly how the brain organises the continuity of lived experience into a filing system of discrete episodes.

Ezzyat and Davachi have made a start. They had 23 participants read six narratives containing dozens of sentences about a protagonist performing everyday activities. Each sentence was displayed one at a time on a screen. Crucially, a minority of sentences began: 'A while later ...', thereby conveying a temporal boundary in the narrative; the end of one episode and start of another. For comparison, a small number of control sentences began: 'A moment later ...', indicating that the ensuing sentence was part of the same episode, not a new one.

After a ten minute break, the participants were given a surprise memory test. Presented with one sentence from the earlier narratives, their task was to recall the sentence that had followed. The key finding here was that the participants were poorer at recalling a sentence that came after a temporal boundary. It's as if information within an episode was somehow bound together, whereas a memory divide was placed between information spanning two episodes.  

A second study was similar to the first except that nineteen participants had their brains scanned during the initial read-through of the sentences. Ezzyat and Davachi identified patterns of neural activity in distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex and the middle-temporal gyrus that either correlated with within-event processing or with forming boundaries between events. These neural activity patterns were more distinct in those participants who showed larger behavioural effects of episode boundaries in their memory performance.

'Our experiments are an important step toward understanding how event perception and segmentation influence the structure of long-term memory,' the researchers concluded. 'The behavioural results support the hypothesis that event segmentation shapes the organisation of long-term memory; the fMRI [brain scanning] results link these memory effects to brain activity consistent with information maintenance and integration within events.'

He's done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I've been highly critical of Dr. Mehmet Oz, &lt;a href="http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/facdb/profile_list.asp?uni=mco2&amp;amp;DepAffil=Surgery"&gt;Vice Chair of the Department of Surgery at Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and medical director of the Integrative Medicine Program (i.e., Columbia's quackademic medicine) program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Those are his academic titles. More important, in terms of his promotion of pseudoscience, is his role as daytime medical show host. Dr. Oz's television show, called, appropriately enough, &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/"&gt;The Dr. Oz Show&lt;/a&gt;, is a direct result of his having been featured on Oprah Winfrey's show on numerous occasions as one of her regular medical experts. Because of his popularity, Dr. Oz became Oprah's protégé and ultimately got his very own popular TV show, which has been quite successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has led me to conclude that I've finally had it with Dr. Oz?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final straw occurred yesterday, but this has been building up for a while. Of course, I always knew that Dr. Oz has a weak spot for "alternative medicine." A decade ago, he was known for bringing reiki masters into the operating room do their mystical magical gestures during cardiac surgery, the better to channel the healing energy of the "universal source" into his patients before they went onto the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. Even so, even though I always knew Dr. Oz was into some woo, most of the times I ever saw him on Oprah's show and the rare occasion that I've seen his show, the worst I could say about him was that he is too prone to mixing perfectly valid, science-based information with the "softer" forms of "complementary and alternative" medicine (CAM) modalities, such as acupuncture and reiki. Even so, CAM didn't seem to be a large part of his show. That seems to have changed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2010 dawned, I became aware of a show in which Dr. Oz promoted &lt;i&gt;reiki&lt;/i&gt; completely uncritically, beginning the year with a show entitled &lt;a href="http://watch.ctv.ca/the-dr-oz-show/season-1/the-dr-oz-show-01-06-10-dr-ozs-ultimate-alternative-medicine-secrets/#clip252328"&gt;Dr. Oz's Ultimate Alternative Medicine Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't too long before Dr. Oz did it again, delivering a two-fer of "quantum" quackery coupled with just plain quackery, inviting Deepak Chopra and Joe Mercola on his show. He also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/01/regarding_dr_mehmet_oz_whoops_maybe_i_sp.php"&gt;hadn't had his children vaccinated against H1N1&lt;/a&gt; and seemed to be sympathetic to the concept that vaccines might somehow cause autism. None of this was good, but, as disturbing as it was, it didn't quite cross a line. Quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2011 dawns, there is no doubt in my mind that Dr. Oz has now inevitably crossed the Woo-bicon, gone over to the Dark Side, betrayed the cause, gone woo, or whatever you want to call it. I say again: Stick a fork in him. He's done, as far as science-based medicine goes. That's because he featured one of the biggest promoters of quackery on the Internet on his show in one fawning segment after another. I'm referring, of course, to &lt;a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Joe Mercola&lt;/a&gt;, who was the main guest on The Dr. Oz Show yesterday in segments entitled &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-1"&gt;The Alternative Health Controversy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-1"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-2"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/alternative-health-controversy-pt-3"&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt;), coupled with another segment entitled &lt;a href="http://www.doctoroz.com/videos/surprising-supplement-you-need"&gt;The Surprising Supplement You Need&lt;/a&gt;. Let's just say that Dr. Oz's journey to the Dark Side is now complete. He has controlled his fear but released his woo, and it is strong woo indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/dr_oz_finally_unequivocally_embraces_the.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/dr_oz_finally_unequivocally_embraces_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/K9gvvPix_e4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295429996365"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49cf481cfc4d3549</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">2011 California Traffic Ticket Fines</title><published>2011-01-19T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/traffic/california2011.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">List details fines for violations of California vehicle codes taking effect in 2011.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295428465853"><id gr:original-id="http://sageinsight.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/does-google-push-the-most-popular-content-rather-than-act-as-a-neutral-tool/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca70395e5d7b7ce8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Does Google push the most popular content rather than act as a neutral tool?</title><published>2011-01-19T02:00:53Z</published><updated>2011-01-19T02:00:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sageinsight.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/does-google-push-the-most-popular-content-rather-than-act-as-a-neutral-tool/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Search engines and the production of academic knowledge From International Journal of Cultural Studies Surveys prove that students performing topic searches for scholarly papers overwhelmingly choose search engines, rather than library-based research discovery networks, as their preferred starting-point. Are they getting the best and most relevant information?

&lt;p&gt;The current issue of &lt;i&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/i&gt; (#606, February 2011) has an interesting piece on the collaboration between Wikileaks, the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and other old media. On page 110 we're told that Wikileaks is "partly hosted on a server in Sweden that is lodged in a former nuclear bunker drilled deep inside the White Mountains". This confused me for a moment, since there is no mountain range of that name in Sweden. Then I realised the journalist's error and laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server plant alluded to in the article is indeed in an area known as Vita bergen, "the white mountains". But it's not a mountain range. It's a low hill in central Stockholm. And the "former nuclear bunker" is one of the old bomb shelters &lt;i&gt;cum&lt;/i&gt; garages excavated into the side of the Vita bergen hill. The place is easy to find, just take the bus to the Church of Sophia. In fact, a photograph of the facility's entrance on page 58 of the magazine issue tells you its name: "&lt;a href="http://www.bahnhof.se/colocation.php"&gt;Pionen - White Mountains&lt;/a&gt;". Anybody can rent server space there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/share"&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash from the BCA decision to sue Simon Singh back in 2009 resulted in a huge &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt; for the profession. Attempting to silence Singh with legal chill had many knock-on effects including &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/allegedly%20making%20misleading%20claims%20in%20advertisements"&gt;one in every four chiropractors in the UK being investigated for making false claims in their advertising&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid prosecution, the McTimoney chiropractors emailed all their members and instructed them to &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/chiropractors-told-to-take-down-their.html"&gt;take down their websites&lt;/a&gt; and “remove information leaflets that state you treat whiplash, colic or other childhood problems in your clinic..”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Australia we haven’t seen anything as hysterical as this, but our paranoid friends over at the AVN were clearly worried, issuing a warning in their Nov 2010 newsletter that sceptics were posing as clients and reporting chiros to the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="chiros warning by scepdoll, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scepdoll/5356393629/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5004/5356393629_cee61478ba.jpg" alt="chiros warning" width="426" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this seems like a silly way to go about reporting chiros – paying them. It’s much simpler to just take a look at their websites or promotional material. Just like the anti-vax handouts I was given by Nimrod “I’m not anti-vaccine, i just don’t recommend it” Weiner, whom I’ve blogged about &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2010/12/04/the-wakefield-in-the-room/"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this would be a problem if they simply operated within their &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:MR82DHkF6k4J:www.ahpra.gov.au/documents/default.aspx%3Frecord%3DWD10%252F1270%26dbid%3DAP%26chksum%3DBB5xYFsBaJui93%252FuvfmFHA%253D%253D+chiropractic+code+of+conduct&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=au&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEESib1UdHhtGp0cXlGMs5AqS6S2Vcg6JbNqqsKd69iW4unFdSQcJkLmvJmZ7GsQ0qs7njB13wIm6LHas9ST3ZiMjx7-n-fbFSAVSlb_aSUZFHYv5clk7_1oF1TPAkhjrp0EhQSRIP&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbQEvJ4OKcQ6W3IPOmFWrWyqxC1DbA"&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt; and stuck to cracking backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="5233400175_e70617e57a_b by scepdoll, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scepdoll/5368942747/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5368942747_b0b0e4cce6.jpg" alt="5233400175_e70617e57a_b" width="500" height="327"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised to see this claim in a leaflet sent to me by a friend earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="c4w_October07_newsletter.pub by scepdoll, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scepdoll/5369569238/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5244/5369569238_1d0d5112b0.jpg" alt="c4w_October07_newsletter.pub" width="239" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text says; &lt;strong&gt;IQ – A study demonstrated an increase in visual perception, motivation, performance and 100% of the sample group showed an increase in IQ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hundred percent of the sample group showed an increase in IQ? Wow, what an extraordinary claim! You’ll note there is no reference provide for this “study”, but if you want one, why not contact them through their &lt;a href="http://www.c4w.com.au/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. (The page above is taken from a newsletter from October 2007). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As @cactopos suggested on Twitter; “I guess you could argue that alternative medicine increases everyone else’s IQ thru a process of natural selection?”. Touche Cactopos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Binds to the ribosome and inhibits it! Basically does what ribosome-binding antibiotics do - they bind, freeze the ribosome in some particular conformation and thus inhibit it. Viomycin can be a gerat example of that.Better still, Zα seems to bind ribosomes nondiscriminantly (both bacterial and mammalian), so using a column with immobilized Zα you could purify ribosomes from whatever cells you have. Sounds fun, and, as I learned from the PI behind the paper - they are working on it, though this practical application is not mentioned in the original paper.References: Feng S, Li H, Zhao J, Pervushin K, Lowenhaupt K, Schwartz TU, &amp;amp; Dröge P (2011).

Poring over the recent Neandertal nuclear genome paper (Green et al. 2010) for seminars, we&amp;#39;re struck by two contradictory ideas. On the one hand, the authors demonstrate pretty convincingly that Neandertals and the more &amp;#39;anatomically modern&amp;#39; humans of Europe and Asia interbred. This doesn&amp;#39;t come from genetic comparisons of Neandertal and contemporaneous human fossils, but of Neandertals with living humans traipsing modern soil. But on the other hand, the authors estimate the time of the divergence of Neandertal and living human populations.

Herein lies the rub:&amp;quot;Population divergence [is] defined as the point in time when two populations last exchanged genes.&amp;quot; (Green et al. 2010: 717)Which they estimate, based on genome sequence divergence and some other assumptions, to be anywhere from ~270,000 - 440,000 years ago. But then this:&amp;quot;[The Out-of-Africa] model for modern human origins suggests that all present-day humans tace all their ancestry back to a small African population that expanded and replaced [Neandertals] without admixture. Our analysis of the Neandertal genome may not be compatible with this view because Neanertals are on average closer to individuals in Eurasia...&amp;quot; (Green et al. 2010: 721)Though they say &amp;quot;may not&amp;quot; they probably should&amp;#39;ve just said &amp;quot;isn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; Either way, they estimate an ancient date at which the groups in question &amp;quot;last exchanged genes,&amp;quot; but also demonstrate that these populations last exchanged genes much more recently.

So what is &amp;quot;population divergence,&amp;quot; then? As a wise man asked, &amp;quot;what does divergence mean when there is reticulation?&amp;quot; (I&amp;#39;m assuming he would prefer to go nameless) Reticulation referring not to pythons or chipmunks, but to mating between individuals in different populations. Is &amp;quot;divergence&amp;quot; not so much the last time genes were exchanged, but rather the time when the genomes began to become different?

Now that I bring it up, wouldn&amp;#39;t it also be neat to see a fight between the reticulated python and northern reticulated chipmunk?

As most people know, malaria is acquired from mosquito bites (Anopheles mosquitoes to be specific), because Plasmodium spp. have complex life cycles that require both an insect (mosquito) and a tetrapod host. Importantly, there is essentially no overlap between the Plasmodium spp. that cause frog, mouse, or human malaria. This host specificity is due to the inability of the parasite to survive in the wrong host as well as the general specificity mosquitoes show in source of bloodmeal, in other words mosquitoes that feed on frogs do not feed on humans.

Now in order to successfully infect a human being, P. falciparum cells must deal with the immune system. The immune system is exquisitely good at destroying foreign invaders, which is why you are alive to read this. So in order for an organism to survive within your tissues and bloodstream it must have a way (or ways) to deal with your immune system. Some organisms simply destroy important parts of the immune system, helper T-cells in the case of HIV, thereby short circuiting the entire system. However, Plasmodium spp, at least the ones that infect mammalian hosts take a different approach. They duck and weave.

Mickey: &amp;quot;I said duck and weave!&amp;quot;

 

From the CDC. We are dealing primarily with the bottom right blue circle. 

Much like a virus, Plasmodium spp. can only grow within an infected cell. When P. falciparum enters the human bloodstream from the mosquito, it first infects liver cells (hepatocytes). Here it divides a bunch of times and differentiates into cells called merrozoites. At this point the immune system is essentially unaware that P. falciparum parasites are growing within the body. Once parasites (merozoites) burst from the hepatocytes, they enter the bloodstream and can infect only red blood cells. This they do quite well, which leads to the production of more parasites (within the red blood cell), which burst forth from the now dead red blood cell looking for fresh red blood cells to infect. This ultimately leads to the reduction in red blood cells in your body, which lead to many of complications associated with malaria.

Marti figure showing Plasmodium within a PV.

What is interesting is that while growing within the red blood cell, the Plasmodium cell is actually growing within a bag inside the red blood cell called the parasitophorus vacuole (PV) not in the cytoplasm (this figure from a review by Matthias Marti et al shows a real life and a cartoon version of PVs within a red blood cell). So the immediate environment from the Plasmodium&amp;#39;s perspective is the PV (the yellow area in the cartoon). However, the source of Plasmodium&amp;#39;s nutrient come from the cytoplasm of the red blood cell (the red area in the cartoon). As you might expect, Plasmodium secretes proteins into the yellow area that enter the PV membrane and are used to take up nutrients from the red blood cell cytoplasm. (Proteins within the Plasmodium plasma membrane can then move nutrients from the PV into the cytoplasm of the Plasmodium cell). Damn, that&amp;#39;s complicated. You might want to reread this paragraph again.

Now everything is well and good from Plasmodium&amp;#39;s perspecitve, it can get enough food. However, it still interacts with the more distal environment, the bloodstream, which means Plasmodium needs to make proteins that enter the PV, cross the PV membrane enter the red blood cell cytoplasm, and then enter the plasma membrane of the red blood cell to be able to see what&amp;#39;s going on in the bloodstream!!!

The major protein that actually does this is called the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1 for short). For the record, an erythrocyte is a fancy word for red blood cell. So PfEMP1 is out there interacting with the bloodstream doing all the things it needs to do, which is primarily interacting with other host (your) cells.

Sounds like everything is kosher for Plasmodium right? Wrong. Once this protein, which is made by a foreign invader, is exposed on the bloodstream, your immune system can see it. You may recall that your immune system kicks ass, so once it sees this PfEMP1 protein hanging out, it will ramp up the defenses and kill the red blood cell (including the growing Plasmodium cells within it). YAY! for you, boo for Plasmodium. It can also kill any RBCs infected with Plasmodium expressing PfEMP1. 

Obviously, malaria wouldn&amp;#39;t kill 3 million people a year if it let the immune system kick its ass. Nope Plasmodium learned long ago (yes Im anthropomorphizing) that sticking PfEMP1 out of the red blood cell is essential yet lethal. To overcome the lethality (from your immune system), Plasmodium encodes ~60 slightly different PfEMP1 proteins. As the immune system ramps up its defenses against one specific PfEMP1, a...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The brief unit on thermodynamics made me fall totally in love. Entropy made sense to me–-scientifically, philosophically. I became a Chemistry major and love every second of it. I got the tattoo to mark my rite of passage–Entropy going both ways, with its symble delta-S in the middle, all supported in the roots of Yggdrasil, the world-tree of Norse mythology (harking back to my English-lit days).”&lt;/p&gt;

The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach." -&lt;i&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But &lt;a href="http://www.xkcd.com/847/"&gt;over at XKCD&lt;/a&gt;, that quote provides little comfort.  After all, "for ever" isn't exactly quite right.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/xkcdpartial.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/xkcdpartial-thumb-500x240-60413.jpg" width="500" height="240" alt="xkcdpartial.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the stars must all exhaust their fuel and die.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's head on over to the Constellation &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_(constellation)"&gt;Ara&lt;/a&gt;, down in the Southern Hemisphere.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/ara.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/ara.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="ara.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking close-up at one spot in the sky, you can find a very special star, known to astronomers as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_Nebula"&gt;Hen 3-1357&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/stingfld.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/stingfld-thumb-500x303-60417.jpg" width="500" height="303" alt="stingfld.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.blackskies.org/reports06.htm#He3-1357"&gt;Kent Wallace&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout most of recorded history, it was a star similar to our Sun, only a little more massive -- maybe two or three times as heavy -- and it was headed towards the end of its life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, when a star like the Sun puts out energy, it does so by fusing light elements into heavier ones in its core.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/i3-2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/i3-2-thumb-500x407-60419.jpeg" width="500" height="407" alt="i3-2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it runs out of the lightest element, Hydrogen, it starts fusing the next lightest element, Helium, into still heavier ones.  And it will keep doing this -- if you can generate enough pressure and temperature -- all the way up until it fuses elements into iron, the most stable of all the elements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/massive_star_onion3d_web.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/massive_star_onion3d_web-thumb-500x500-60421.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="massive_star_onion3d_web.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of its life, the star becomes a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant"&gt;red giant&lt;/a&gt;, swelling to many times its normal size.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/red_size.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/red_size-thumb-500x500-60423.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="red_size.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best known red giant, actually, is your friend &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/05/how_to_make_a_real_shooting_st.php"&gt;Mira&lt;/a&gt;, which isn't just a red giant, but is a special type of red giant that lives on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_Giant_Branch"&gt;asymptotic giant branch&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stars, more massive than our Sun (but not &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; massive that they'll go supernova), actually pulse, and start to blow off their outer layers, which expand incredibly fast and cool down, forming a protoplanetary nebula.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/File%3AEgg%20Nebula.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/File%3AEgg%20Nebula-thumb-500x296-60425.jpeg" width="500" height="296" alt="File:Egg Nebula.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image: the Egg nebula, a protoplanetary nebula imaged by Hubble.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then it happens.  That last bit of burnable fuel gets used up, and that's the end of your star!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, kind of.  The core of the star contracts, and forms a white dwarf, releasing a large amount of energy.  The outer layers get permanently blown off, and create a planetary nebula that gets lit up by the energy released from the inner core's contraction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "moment of death" of the star in Ara occurred in 1987, and formed the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_Nebula"&gt;Stingray Nebula&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/StingrayNebulaHubble.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/StingrayNebulaHubble-thumb-500x429-60427.jpg" width="500" height="429" alt="StingrayNebulaHubble.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Image credit: Hubble space telescope, 1996.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the very interior, we can actually see that there are &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; stars; this is a binary star system!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/stingraybinary.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/stingraybinary-thumb-500x423-60429.jpg" width="500" height="423" alt="stingraybinary.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's going on at the outside is by far more interesting.  This object is way smaller than every other planetary nebula we know about; it's only a few percent of a normal nebula's size!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you see those "blips" on either side?  That look like something is starting to blow the gas outward?  That's a glimpse into the future of what this planetary nebula is going to look like!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than a perfectly symmetric nebula, we're likely to wind up with something with a definite preferred axis.  Maybe it'll be extreme, like the Boomerang Nebula?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/5095567894_d6138043e7.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/5095567894_d6138043e7-thumb-500x464-60431.jpeg" width="500" height="464" alt="5095567894_d6138043e7.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it will be a beautiful, intricate pattern lengthened in one direction, like the most photogenic of nebulae, the Cat's Eye Nebula?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/catsEye_hst_full.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/catsEye_hst_full-thumb-500x500-60433.jpeg" width="500" height="500" alt="catsEye_hst_full.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Last two images by Hubble, of course!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, this isn't so much a death as a transformation.  Your 15th magnitude Red Giant from the Asymptotic Giant Branch isn't gone so much as it's blowing off its outer layers and evolving into a white dwarf.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kind of similar to...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/Butterfly-Caterpillar.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2011/01/the_stingray_nebula_and_xkcd/Butterfly-Caterpillar-thumb-500x199-60435.jpg" width="500" height="199" alt="Butterfly-Caterpillar.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...a caterpillar morphing into a butterfly!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it isn't really "death" at all, it's simply the next stage of this star's life cycle.  And if we started with Lord of the Rings, it's only fitting to end it the same way.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pippin&lt;/i&gt;: I didn't think it would end this way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gandalf&lt;/i&gt;: End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pippin&lt;/i&gt;: What? Gandalf? See what?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gandalf&lt;/i&gt;: White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pippin&lt;/i&gt;: Well, that isn't so bad.

Today, we’re doing the opposite – showcasing ten Hollywood movie stars who’ve gained serious weight for a movie role (or, who are we kidding, in the hopes of nabbing an Oscar, which several of them did). Losing or gaining, we’re not into dramatic weight shifts simply for the sake of a paycheck and royalties, no matter how hefty. It’s simply not healthy, even under the care of a professional. (A few of these celebs actually have experienced lasting negative health effects from their rapid weight gain.) In the cases of most of the gents, you’ll hardly recognize them. But the funny thing is that a few of the women actually look &lt;em&gt;more normal and real&lt;/em&gt; after having put some meat on their bones. (Obviously, they were way too skinny to begin with.) Check out our gallery of ten stars who aren’t afraid to transform themselves into slightly overweight people whom Hollywood would never cast in movies in the first place. (And see exactly how much they gained during their hardcore hunt for Oscar.)&lt;/p&gt;

Smokers and former smokers will understand what I mean when I say that an addiction to smoking is like a pilot light that is always lit, always ready to whoosh into full flame with the application of a few milligrams of nicotine. And they will also understand that feeling, like a bolt sliding home, of instant identification that comes from seeing someone else smoking. Especially if you are not smoking, but wish to be. 

It makes sense that a smoker or former smoker who sees someone smoking might find that image to be a trigger for nicotine craving. But we have to ask whether smokers trying to quit are really endangering their newfound abstinence simply by viewing “smoking content” on TV or in the movies. It seems a bit too prudish to be true. Yet, logic would seem to suggest that some sort of behavioral effect might be expected when a smoker in withdrawal sees an image of someone smoking.  Does, say, viewing scenes of smoking in a movie produce changes in brain function robust enough to trigger relapse in the absence of any other direct cues? Are environmental cues of this nature more dangerous to newly abstinent smokers than we thought?

“Our findings support prior studies that show smokers who exit a movie that had images of smoking are more likely to crave a cigarette, compared with ones who watched a movie without them,” said Dylan Wagner of Dartmouth College, in a Society for Neuroscience Press Release. “More work is needed to show whether brain activity in response to movie smoking predicts relapse for a smoker trying to quit.”

In a small study involving 17 smokers and 17 non-smokers, scientists at Dartmouth College set out to determine what differences might show up in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan of smokers and non-smokers while they watched 30 minutes of a movie with several smoking scenes. The subjects were not told that the experiment was about smoking. But when they viewed smoking scenes, the brains of smokers showed increased activity in a portion of the parietal lobe of the brain called the intraparietal sulcus. The study was published in the January 19 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.

What does this brain region do? As it happens, the neurons in the intraparietal sulcus encode information about the position and geometrical properties of objects. This part of the brain coordinates eye movement data and reaching movements.  Using a mouse or a joystick is a good example of an activity that involves the intraparietal sulcus.

The intraparietal sulcus, or IPS, has other functions, but primarily it serves, in the words of one study, as an interface “between the perceptive and motor systems for controlling arm and eye movements in space.”  Apparently, the habitual hand gestures used in lighting and smoking a cigarette, when viewed in a movie or commercial, triggered impulses from that part charged with controlling the routine gestural aspects of smoking--if the viewer were actually smoking. 

 Other studies point to additional aspects of this event-related change in fMRI scans. Writing in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2006, Hamilton and Grafton offer evidence that the IPS is also “uniquely sensitive to the goals of other people’s hand actions.” The intraparietal sulcus seems to “know” what those hand gestures mean, in a sense. Macaques in the lab were used to demonstrate that “cells in macaque IPL were show to respond selectively to both the performance and observation of an action within a sequence leading to a specific goal and not to the same action when it was part of a sequence achieving a different goal.”

This was a strong suggestion that “the IPS is not just a relay but has a central role in representing and interpreting the goals of observed hand actions.”

Perhaps, then, the idea that strong cues can be produced by images and associations is not so far-fetched. It is, for that matter, the founding theory upon which the modern advertising industry has been built, and while the argument over advertising’s effectiveness is never-ending, cigarette scenes in films might have to be considered a form of indirect advertising beamed directly to the parietal lobe of smokers (and perhaps former smokers as well.)

It reveals that the &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110118/ap_on_re_eu/eu_ireland_catholic_abuse"&gt;Vatican was officially instructing its clergy to hide pedophilia cases from civil authorities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signed by the late Archbishop Luciano Storero, Pope John Paul II's diplomat to Ireland, the letter instructs Irish bishops that their new policy of making the reporting of suspected crimes mandatory "gives rise to serious reservations of both a moral and canonical nature."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Storero wrote that canon law, which required abuse allegations and punishments to be handled within the church, "must be meticulously followed." Any bishops who tried to impose punishments outside the confines of canon law would face the "highly embarrassing" position of having their actions overturned on appeal in Rome, he wrote.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Child-abuse activists in Ireland said the 1997 letter demonstrates that the protection of pedophile priests from criminal investigation was not only sanctioned by Vatican leaders but ordered by them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"The letter is of huge international significance, because it shows that the Vatican's intention is to prevent reporting of abuse to criminal authorities. And if that instruction applied here, it applied everywhere," said Colm O'Gorman, director of the Irish chapter of human rights watchdog Amnesty International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have serious reservations of a moral character about the Catholic church, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am bemused by the threat that if a church dared to invoke civil authorities to protect the children in their charge from rapacious priests, their actions would be overturned by the Vatican. Is that basically saying that if locals do anything other than work with the Vatican to quarantine child-rapers, the Vatican will do whatever they can to put the rapist right back into his position? Sweet. They really don't care at all about their congregations, do they?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/oops_i_think_that_letter_was_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eXwbLLR9ssU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295394462408"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-1765424308835346125">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5745f0cb9310bccb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="pseudoscience" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Just as Valid</title><published>2011-01-18T23:44:00Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T23:47:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2011/01/just-as-valid.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/1765424308835346125/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=1765424308835346125&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Given the recent hubbub over the Zodiac getting a shot of realism, of course, it was ripe for &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/your-horoscopes-week-of-january-18-2011%2C18855/"&gt;parody from the Onion&lt;/a&gt;.

Image courtesy NASA&amp;#39;s Earth Observatory.)Western Pacific gray whales are among the most endangered whales on Earth, with a population of only 113 to 130 individuals. In contrast, the gray whales who migrate along the western coast of North America—known as the eastern Pacific gray whales—comprise a population estimated at between 15,000 and 22,000 individuals.The good news is that as recently as 1972 Flex and the western grays were believed extinct. Still, the margins are thin. The IUCN Red List categorizes the western grays as critically endangered—the last stage before extinction: [B]ased on an extinction probability exceeding 50% within three generations, or a projected continuing decline of the subpopulation in combination with a mature population size less than  250. In addition, the small absolute subpopulation size, and the estimate of at most 35 reproductive females means that the subpopulation  would easily qualify as Endangered.          (Gray whale. Photo by Jim Borrowman, Straitwatch, courtesy NOAA.) Until now, no one has known where Flex and his kin go after leaving the Okhotsk Sea. At this time of year the eastern grays have migrated south to the breeding lagoons along Mexico&amp;#39;s Baja Peninsula. But the western whales—or at least, Flex—show no signs of heading for warmer water....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

This achingly earth-like planet made a major buzz, and in fact &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/10/29/how-many-habitable-planets-are-there-in-the-galaxy/"&gt;I used its characteristics&lt;/a&gt; to estimate that there could be billions of Earthlike planets in our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s just one small, really eensy-teensy problem: the planet may not exist. But it also might. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still early in the game here, and there’s a lot going on… but it’s worth peeking a bit deeper. There’s science here, and math, and even some interesting media jiggery-pokery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding planets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know of more than 500 planets orbiting other stars, and astronomers have a diverse set of tools to find them. The first were discovered by what’s called reflexive motion (&lt;a href="http://www.astrobio.net/images/galleryimages_images/Gallery_Image_7135.gif"&gt;a nice animation of this is on the Astrobio.net site&lt;/a&gt;); as a planet orbits a star, the planet’s gravity tugs on the star, causing a tiny Doppler ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/3i00hd7iomquf4dkhramao81dk/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fbadastronomy%2F2011%2F01%2F18%2Fdoes-gliese-581g-exist%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~4/YAEM5_ZxeJ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295388742463"><id gr:original-id="http://maukamakai.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/leapin-blennies/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/574669ed7c780553</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Leapin’ Blennies</title><published>2011-01-18T15:58:11Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T15:58:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/izKGUewj_R4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://maukamakai.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/leapin-blennies/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In true science writer geekdom, I have spent the last week trying to figure out where the name “blenny” comes from.

&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/poll-of-the-day-have-you-ever-been-on-the-pill/"&gt;50-year anniversary of the pill&lt;/a&gt; sparked an onslaught of articles about the revolutionary force of birth control, making it seem like every woman in modern America is benefiting (or suffering) from its use. But according to the U.S. &lt;a href="http://blisstree.com/live/census-report-americans-eat-less-meat-more-organics/"&gt;Census Bureau’s newest Statistical Abstract&lt;/a&gt;, the pill isn’t the un-matched Goliath of contraceptives it’s made out to be; in fact, sterilization is even more popular — we’re just not talking (or reading) about it nearly as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Census Bureau statistics reveal that, while 61% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 use some form of contraception, only 17.3% of us are actually on the pill. Meanwhile, sterilization is just as responsible (or more) for keeping us from breeding like Catholics. According to the census report, 16.7% of women have been sterilized themselves, and 6.1% have male partners who’ve been sterilized. It’s not a shocker that women between 15 and 44 use methods besides the pill (or none at all), but last we checked, most women weren’t gabbing about sterilization options, either. So why are so many women getting their tubes tied, and why isn’t anyone talking about it? We asked around to find out why sterilization is secretly the most popular kind of birth control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract draws on data recorded between 2002 – 2008, but according to Dr. Vanessa Cullins, the Vice President for Medical Affairs for &lt;a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/"&gt;Planned Parenthood Federation of America&lt;/a&gt;, it’s been popular since way before then: “Permanent birth control, or sterilization, has long been the most popular method of birth control among couples. More women rely on permanent birth control for themselves or their partners than any other method.” She also points out that, unlike other methods, which have a rotating cast of users, women who use sterilization are forever in that statistical pool: “One reason tubal sterilization and vasectomy continue to be the most popular birth control is because they are permanent methods. Unlike reversible contraceptive methods, which people readily start, stop, and switch among, permanent contraception is forever; every year those who choose permanent methods continue to add to the pool of those who already have undergone sterilization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the statistics focus on women in a limited age bracket, indicating that a lot more would-be fertile women are getting sterilized than popular culture (and conversations with our girlfriends) suggests. After all, we visited the gynecologist with nearly ever Sex and the City girl, but never did we get to hear about the merits of tubal sterilization, did we? And despite her clear disdain for children, we don’t remember Samantha ever singing the praises of permanent birth control to Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda at brunch. For many women in their twenties and thirties, the procedure is something that an older relative might mention, having gotten their tubes tied after the birth of their last child, having decided their family was complete, but it seems more like an old-fashioned remedy than a modern day contraceptive option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterilization seems scary, but then so would taking the pill, if we didn’t read articles about it, see wholesome, all-American models shilling for it all the time, and feel comfortable talking about it with our friends. But pharmaceutical companies are putting big money behind advertisements and PR pushes for the seemingly endless variety of oral contraceptives — and it’s no wonder, given their price tag — while sterilization, which results in minimal profits for drug companies, hardly gets any kind of press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our friends aren’t talking about it, and there’s certainly no TV show putting it out there, we asked Dr. Cullins why so many women are secretly choosing sterilization. “For the last several decades, most women and men have not considered permanent methods until they reach their mid to late 30s — a time when many of those who have children have determined that their families are complete,” she explained. “Many women choose tubal sterilization because it is more than 99 percent effective, there are virtually no side effects, and complications are rare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is sterilization a good option for you? “While women and men should certainly give considerable thought as to whether they want to permanently forego the option of having biological children, permanent methods are safe and highly effective ways to prevent unintended pregnancy for women and men who are sure they want no children in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you or your partner considered sterilization? Would you be willing to trade in your biological parenting options for permanent, reliable birth control? Tell us whether or not you’re willing to tie your tubes in our comments section, below:&lt;/p&gt;

If true, it would be very cool. But in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110117/full/news.2011.23.html?s=news_rss"&gt;Amy Maxmen&lt;/a&gt; quotes scientists who don’t like the study at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If this was a study looking for shared genes in patients with diabetes, it would not be up to the standards of the field,” says David Altshuler, a geneticist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge. “We set these standards after 10 years of seeing so many irreproducible results in gene-association studies.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because most genes have modest effects on behaviour or health, many scientists assume that thousands of SNPs — rather than six — need to be analysed before a correlation to any trait can be confidently made. Geneticists are often hard-pressed to find one SNP in a million that reproducibly correlates with a disease, says Altshuler. “It’s like the team bought six lottery tickets and won the megabucks twice — this is not how things work.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The availablity of all those quantifiable metrics extracted by Google Books has fueled the establishment of a &lt;a href="http://fame.gonzolabs.org/"&gt;Science Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, which lists scientists by an objective measure of their fame, the frequency with which they are cited in books. It was &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/143.3.full"&gt;announced in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where they also introduced a new unit of measure, the milli-Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to compare scientists to one another, it is helpful to have a standard unit of fame. I proposed one that would make this kind of fame easy to comprehend: the Darwin. It is defined as the average annual frequency that "Charles Darwin" appears in English-language books from the year when he was 30 years old (1839) until 2000. Because it is such a big unit of fame, it has proved more convenient to use one-thousandth of that frequency: the milli-Darwin, abbreviated as mD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/misc/webfeat/gonzoscientist/episode14/index.xhtml"&gt;Here's the list of over 4,000 famous scientists&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them aren&amp;#39;t famous for science — Lewis Carroll, for instance — but all are notable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where's the coincidence? It turns out that on the same day the Science Hall of Fame was announced, a &lt;a href="http://www.creationsciencehalloffame.org/page3.html"&gt;small gang of loons&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href="http://www.creationsciencehalloffame.org/index.html"&gt;Creation Science Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, "Honoring those who honored God's Word as literally written in Genesis." There are a few differences between the two halls. The creation science group, unsurprisingly, is begging for money: they want $4 million in donations. Why? They want to build a physical monument somewhere in the neighborhood of the Creation "Museum," which sounds like a horrible idea to me. It would create a black hole of concentrated stupidity in the heart of Kentucky that might destroy the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that they aren&amp;#39;t using any kind of objective metric to identify famous creationists — apparently, they just look around and pick someone from the godly pantheon. So far, they&amp;#39;ve got two: &lt;a href="http://www.creationsciencehalloffame.org/page5.html"&gt;Henry Morris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.creationsciencehalloffame.org/page6.html"&gt;Duane Gish&lt;/a&gt;. Two against the 4,000+ in the Science Hall of Fame. Sounds about right, although zero would be a better number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, opening up the door to scrutiny like that just means the scientists will use the Google microscope to examine the creationist nominees. It doesn&amp;#39;t look good. Creationists like to compare Gish to TH Huxley — &amp;quot;Gish has been called &amp;#39;creationism&amp;#39;s T.H. Huxley,&amp;quot; says Wikipedia — but now we can actually &lt;a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=Thomas+Henry+Huxley%2CDuane+Gish&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=0"&gt;compare Gish and Huxley&lt;/a&gt;. Huxley gets 102mD. Gish gets 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No contest. It was very nice of the creationists to step into the arena and get such a drubbing, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/dueling_halls_of_fame.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/VMXrws4HEAg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295381435970"><id gr:original-id="http://raverat.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/antisocial-personality-disorder-demon-doctors/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca9737dd7cf3f6d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Antisocial Personality Disorder: Demon Doctors</title><published>2011-01-18T13:13:06Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T13:13:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/NmT6jR8cliQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://raverat.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/antisocial-personality-disorder-demon-doctors/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">This is my second article in the series on antisocial personality disorder, which because of my unduly sloth has not been completed yet.

The HKB phenomena are movement phenomena, however; simply noting that the same qualitative pattern is seen in different judgement and action studies is a good first step but only suggestive, at best. We therefore next took simultaneous judgement &amp;amp; action measures from a movement task where we manipulated the feedback display (Wilson et al, 2005a). For instance, when the display showed 0°, movement was stable, even when the movement was at, for example, 90°. Perception of relative phase was driving the stability of the movements. On the basis of all this data, the model predicts that the reason 0° and 180° are easy is that the information specifying that you are moving this way is easily perceived. There is provisional evidence to support relative direction of motion as the specifying information (Bogaerts et al, 2003; Wilson et al, 2005b; Wimmers et al, 1992) with relative speed acting as a noise term. This variable certainly predicts the observed pattern, as the relative direction of motion is only stable at 0° and 180°. It is maximally variable at 90°, which would explain why movements here are also maximally unstable. The model is therefore explaining the problem with moving at 90° as a problem detecting the information required to maintain the coordination; as we saw in the case of friction, no information means unstable behaviour. The model therefore makes a critical prediction. If we could improve people&amp;#39;s ability to perceive 90°, they should gain the ability to move at 90° without any practice at the movement itself. All previous learning studies had entailed training people to move by having them move, with the help of various forms of transformed feedback methods (visual metronomes or Lissajous plots; more on this when I discuss feedback). The prediction, that movement stability should improve with improved perceptual ability, is a strong test of both the model and the modelling strategy in general, and the experiment to test it was the first half of my dissertation.The experiment itself was actually very straight-forward, although time consuming to run. BaselineWe took Baseline measures of action stability by having participants use a joystick to control a dot on the screen so as to move at 0°, 180° or 90° to an oscillating dot on the screen (Figure 1). We measured movement stability as the proportion of time spent at the target relative phase, +/- 20°. Everyone produced the standard HKB pattern (good movement stability at 0°, good but lower stability at 180°, terrible at 90°; see the black lines in Figure 3). We split the participants into two groups of 6 (Learning and Control), balanced according to their ability to move at 90°. Figure 1. Schematic of the setup for the action taskWe also took Baseline measures of perceptual ability at 90° and 180°. Participants viewed two displays, one moving at the target relative phase and the other at some different relative phase; the magnitude of the difference on each trial was randomly selected from 10 alternatives. This is a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) psychophysical procedure, using a non-adaptive staircase. We computed the difference required before people could reliably tell the difference between the two displays (75% correct) and used this as an estimate of the threshold. See Figure 2. Figure 2. Schematic of the judgement task.Thresholds at 180° were approximately 11°, i.e. the displays needed to be different by 11° before participants could reliably tell the difference. Baseline thresholds for 90° were 24° - much higher, and also highly variable both within and between participant. This matches nicely to the original visual perception study results. TrainingWe then extensively trained the 6 people in the Learning group on the perceptual judgement task until their thresholds settled out and stopped changing. This took between 7 and 14 sessions, so the training was time consuming. The training had the participants make increasingly difficult discriminations of 90°; they received &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;incorrect&amp;#39; feedback and were shown 90° again when they made an error. There was no exposure to the movement task.Thresholds at 90° steadily decreased over training, and settled out at 12°, very similar to performance at 180°.Post Training and RetentionThese sessions repeated the Baseline; Post Training was at least 1 day after the final training session, and Retention was at least 1 week after.The question was simple: had the Learning group improved in their ability to move at 90°? What about the Control group, who did the same number of movement trials - had they improved at 90° just by trying the movement?The results were straightforward: only the Learning group improved their movement stability, and only at 90° (the learning did not generalise) - see Figure 3.Figure 3. Movement stability data from the three Assessment sessionsThe conclusion was straight-forward: the Learning group was able to use their improved perceptual ability to maintain movement stability. As we noted in the paper, this is not a case of learning generalising from the perceptual to the action domain: there is only the perception-action domain, and the training altered the perception-action system. This experiment, therefore, clearly demonstrated that movement stability is a function of perceptual ability; 0° isn&amp;#39;t stable because there&amp;#39;s an attractor there (as per the dynamic pattern hypothesis), there&amp;#39;s an attractor there because 0° is stably perceived!Some commentsThere were two ways, in principle, that the perceptual learning might have helped perceive 90°. First, the training could have improved people&amp;#39;s discrimination of the relative direction of motion. However, we noted that at 90° this is unavoidably variable and noisy, and so it might not be possible to ever improve detection of it. The alternative is to learn to use a new information variable, one which is detectable and specifies 90°. In support of this, perceptual learning at 90° did not transfer to perceptual or action performance at 0° or 180°. We directly tested this in the second half of my dissertation, which I...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN – A newly revealed 1997 letter from the Vatican warned  Ireland’s Catholic bishops not to report all suspected child-abuse cases  to police — a disclosure that victims groups described as “the smoking  gun” needed to show that the Vatican enforced a worldwide culture of  cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, obtained by Irish broadcasters RTE and  provided to The Associated Press, documents the Vatican’s rejection of a  1996 Irish church initiative to begin helping police identify pedophile  priests following Ireland’s first wave of publicly disclosed lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter undermines persistent Vatican claims,  particularly when seeking to defend itself in U.S. lawsuits, that the  church in Rome never instructed local bishops to withhold evidence or  suspicion of crimes from police. It instead emphasizes the church’s  right to handle all child-abuse allegations, and determine punishments,  in house rather than hand that power to civil authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signed by the late Archbishop Luciano Storero, Pope  John Paul II’s diplomat to Ireland, the letter instructs Irish bishops  that their new policy of making the reporting of suspected crimes  mandatory “gives rise to serious reservations of both a moral and  canonical nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Read more at the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;So much for the benign nature of mainstream, non-fundamentalist faiths.  This is the &lt;em&gt;governance&lt;/em&gt; of the Catholic Church; are people still going to assert that “regular” religion is not harmful?&lt;/p&gt;

The Internet – nowadays available to anyone with a computer – offers all sorts of products and services that we should be able to assume have at least been considered by one of our federal agencies for legitimacy before being offered for sale. In the USA, the Federal Drug Administration [FDA] and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] are in place to serve in that capacity, but they don’t because they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a credit card can freely order diet drugs, sexual dysfunction devices and supplements, and a variety of items that are said to enhance athletic performance, and these are often sold exclusively via the Internet to escape regulation. Take one example, the “Slimming Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules,” which the vendors assured customers were “100% herbal” and “a Natural vitamin and calcium capsule.” But these pills – illegally – contained a powerful prescription-strength stimulant that in some patients could have brought about a heart attack. Luckily, this product was “withdrawn at the FDA’s request” before anyone was fatally affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold on! The FDA &lt;i&gt;requested&lt;/i&gt; that it be withdrawn? They didn’t &lt;i&gt;order&lt;/i&gt; its removal from sale? No, because the FDA can’t require that a product be intensively, independently, examined. They could do this themselves and pay for the research, spending our taxpayer money to do it, but they haven’t the budget. The quackery is just offered for sale. FDA surveillance and/or testing is limited by the huge size of the Internet industry, the other FDA duties, and lack of empowerment and resources to examine products before they’re put on sale. It’s a case of available manpower. FDA spokesperson Siobhan DeLancey says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0in 0.5in 0.0001pt"&gt; &amp;quot;The reality is that we are lacking resources in terms of authority and money… we allocate our funds to best protect the public health…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the number of supplements, alone – from an estimated 40,000 to 75,000 including everything from vitamin C to weight-loss products – means that neither the FDA nor the FTC can possibly keep track of them all. And anyone, anywhere in the world, can set up a web page with a US address on it, and stay safely outside of the law. Technically, the FTC has the responsibility of regulating fraudulent advertising and the merchandising of supplements and services, but that would mean monitoring literally thousands of products and hundreds of thousands of ads. The result is that this agency only gets to handle a few dozen cases a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we’re simply not properly nor adequately protected from fake products, false advertising, and possibly fatal “supplements” and “services” that bring in untold sums from naïve victims.

The disgust on her face was apparent. As was her frustration when she shook her head at the man standing numbly beside her and said, &amp;quot;You have the emotional depth of a turnip!&amp;quot; The rest of us in the subway car did our best to look busy—headphones were put on, games were played on cell phones, even the morning newspaper made a few reappearances even though it was the evening rush hour.

I have to admit that I was somewhat amused by the situation because I&amp;#39;d recently directed this phrase at a male friend myself, albeit in a less charged environment. The subway man&amp;#39;s response was interesting: He appeared bewildered. And the response was eerily similar to that of the recipient of my own statement (though in fairness he accepted my diagnosis with some grace). Admittedly, I don&amp;#39;t know the cause of this couple&amp;#39;s argument, and I certainly don&amp;#39;t know anything about their personalities or the nature of their relationship. Still the perceived shared response made me pause. I don&amp;#39;t mean to imply that all men lack complex emotional responses—emotions and relationships are difficult to analyze and label in broad, social terms. Appropriate social and emotional responses are often culturally driven, and produced to various degrees dependent on personality. Nonetheless, regardless of cultural association, some people, both male and female, seem more emotionally expressive and perceptive when compared to others—is there a biological explanation for this?

Possibly. But not in the way you would think.

Emotions are a conscious experience. They&amp;#39;re physical and we know they&amp;#39;re happening. Even when we incorrectly identify them (e.g., saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not angry!&amp;quot; when in fact you&amp;#39;re furious), we still experience them. But researchers Winkielman and Berridge (2004) have suggested that in some cases, emotional processes may be unconscious, or implicit—that is, we may feel something without being aware that we&amp;#39;re having the feeling or behaving in a certain way. We may be influenced by subliminal stimuli. For example, research participants were exposed to several expressive faces and asked to then either pour themselves a drink or rate the drink. After viewing happy expressions, participants were more likely to drink more and pay more for their drink, especially if they were in fact thirsty (122).  Participants were asked to rate their own mood and reported no changes, which suggests no awareness about changes in mood. This consequently implies that they were swayed by subliminal messaging.

Winkielman and Berridge argue that the evolutionary purpose of emotions is to regulate appropriate responses—it helps us negotiate our networks:Basic affective reactions are widely shared by animals, including reptiles and fish, and at least in some species may not involve conscious awareness comparable to that in humans. The original function of emotion was to allow the organism to react appropriately to positive or negative events, and conscious feelings might not always have been required (2004: 122).Basic affective responses, such as liking pleasant experiences or feeling fear in threatening situations, may be hardwired into our social circuitry. These responses are controlled by subcortical structures in the brain—such as the amygdala—which carry out preconscious operations. Anencephalic infants, for example, who possess only a brainstem still demonstrate positive reactions to agreeable experiences like tasting sugar, and negative reactions to tasting bitter items. 

The role the amygdala plays in emotional response is not fully understood. As discussed above, there may be some connection between the amygdala and basic affective responses. Anderson and Phelps (2000) presented a case study of a patient known as SP who suffered from lesions in the region of the amydala. In tests that asked her to identify the emotions of others, she demonstrated a diminished sensitivity to interpreting disgust and happiness: Across patients, however, damage to the amygdala is most associated with impairments in the recognition of fear. Further, SP exhibited a pattern of impairment in the evaluation of expressions other than fear that is largely consistent with her extra-amygdalar damage in the right anteromedial temporal lobe. Thus, we conservatively assert that SP&amp;#39;s deficits in recognizing expressions of fear are associated with lesions of her amygdala (Anderson and Phelps 2000: 108).There is some belief that the amygdala in particular may play a role in our ability to learn and interpret nonverbal social communication. Both Winkielman and Berridge (2004) and Anderson and Phelps (2000) make reference to the importance for nonhuman primates to recognize social displays of fear and suggest that these responses may be based in this structure: &amp;quot;fearful facial expressions may be important for learning to fear previously neutral environmental stimuli&amp;quot; (Anderson and Phelps 2000: 111). 

However, I&amp;#39;m going to work with the assumption that both the subway man and my clueless friend have fully functional amydaloid regions. It&amp;#39;s possible that there is a gender difference when it comes to emotional understanding and response. A recent article from Hoffman and colleagues (2010) reports that women are better at interpreting subtle emotional clues. When asked to appropriately label facially expressed emotions, women were significantly better at picking up on low intensity emotional cues, so a glance or a movement may be significant to woman in a way that&amp;#39;s very different to a man. In light of the discussion by Winkielman and Berridge, I&amp;#39;ll venture to say that women may be more likely to respond to subliminal stimuli as well. Men appear to have trouble distinguishing anger and sadness from each other at low intensity expressions—so men aren&amp;#39;t likely to pick up that you&amp;#39;re upset if you&amp;#39;re silently fuming, ladies.

The reasons for this difference isn&amp;#39;t clear. There isn&amp;#39;t a clear biological divide as to why women may be more perceptive than men when it comes to emotions. Certainly socialization may play a role in emotional sensitivity. But is that all there is to it? Perhaps emotional sensitivity plays a role in our evolutionary history—in hierarchical groups, it would have been beneficial to be able to read the social cues of others, particularly when they ranked higher within the group. It could have potentially saved the lives of offspring, and assured continued group membership and protection. For example, knowing when to avoid the group&amp;#39;s matriarch or the Alpha male, could have been useful knowledge to have.

In this case, and in my own experience, these studies highlight that that there is in fact the potential for a biological and social divide in communication between the sexes that goes beyond simple socialization. Again, this is not to suggest that all men are emotional turnips or that women are all hypersensitive and savvy to emotions, but it does advocate for a bit of patience on both of our parts—particularly in public confrontations.

Until recently, it was difficult to assess the number of repeated DNA sequences in the genome. In a recent publication, researchers at the 1000 Genomes Project and collaborators have invented new methods to study and find repetitive DNA sequences in the human genome, and have found that CNVs occur in only 7%-9% of human genes. They used the new techniques to compare the entire genomes of 159 individuals and were able to accurately assay previously unidentified duplicated genes.

For sequencing, the researchers picked and cultured 144 fosmid clones (from libraries prepared by shotgun cloning of genomic DNA) from eight selected individuals. After fosmid DNA purification, clone DNA was arrayed in a 96-well plate (two clones combined from unrelated loci for some). Bar-coded sequencing libraries were created separately from each well using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina-compatible), using 100 ng of fosmid DNA per well as the starting material. The 96 bar-coded Nextera libraries were pooled and sequenced on two lanes of an Illumina GAII (paired-end, 2 x 76-bp reads, with an additional 9-bp index read). Reads were mapped to the genome and analyzed as described in the supplementary information.

The authors report:

"We identified 4.1 million ‘singly unique nucleotide’ positions informative in distinguishing specific copies…these data identify human-specific expansions in genes associated with brain development, reveal extensive population genetic diversity, and detect signatures consistent with gene conversion in the human species. Our approach makes ~1000 genes accessible to genetic studies of disease association."

How nice! But then, unfortunately, he had to ruin it by &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/republican_party/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/01/18/alabama_governor_christians"&gt;making a few exceptions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you have been adopted in God's family like I have, and like you have if you're a Christian and if you're saved, and the Holy Spirit lives within you just like the Holy Spirit lives within me, then you know what that makes? It makes you and me brothers. And it makes you and me brother and sister. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now I will have to say that, if we don't have the same daddy, we're not brothers and sisters. So anybody here today who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, I'm telling you, you're not my brother and you're not my sister, and I want to be your brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gosh. I guess Christians in Alabama are just extra-special people. The rest of us — Muslims, Buddhists, atheists, agnostics, Hindus, animists, whatever — not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

He's reduced to nonsensical whines about persecution, and acts as if he's baffled about the criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article raises a question: why is the Courier-Journal even concerned with possible attendance at the Ark? If the attraction does not meet its projected figures, the state government and its citizens are not impacted—except positively, in that the attraction will still produce state sales tax to benefit Kentucky and its citizens regardless of the attendance. So why the paper&amp;#39;s concern? Where is the story? Ultimately, what is the article&amp;#39;s author, an &amp;quot;investigative&amp;quot; reporter, supposedly investigating here? If backers of a tourist attraction like an amusement park with thrill rides would also want to locate in Kentucky and its feasibility study showed 1.6 million guests the first year, would the paper also &amp;quot;investigate&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor dumb Ken. I'll try to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without considering the finances, people are right to be concerned about the construction of another exhibit dedicated to ignorance in the state. It harms their reputation, it is bad for education, and it can have long-term consequences for the economy that are not good. Do you really want to be known as the state with the really stupid workforce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an automatic win situation for the state, no matter how Ham tries to spin it. The state will be investing resources in this project, and while Ken Ham seems unconcerned if the actual attendance is much less than the estimate, the state should be: that affects the economic viability of the project. Granting millions of dollars in incentives to a big theme park that flops is not good for the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Answers in Genesis were not looking for state money and expecting the state to expand the highways and other infrastructure projects, and was the sole contributor to the expenses, there wouldn&amp;#39;t be as much concern about the funny numbers in their feasibility study…but they aren&amp;#39;t alone. They&amp;#39;re looking to drag down other investors with a scheme built on unreliable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, if a non-religious group showed up in the state and asked for a $50 million handout to build their theme park, I'm sure the paper would investigate. Dodgy schemes with a poor record of success are always ripe for investigative reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ham ought to read this &lt;a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110118/OPINION01/301180036/Ark+s+prospects"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;. It lays out the facts very clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest shoe to drop, Courier-Journal reporter Andrew Wolfson wrote in Sunday's editions that a half-dozen theme-park experts find that the developers' estimates of 1.6 million annual visitors to the Ark park are wildly optimistic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They note that Kentucky Kingdom, which is now closed but hopes to reopen in 2012, and Holiday World in Southern Indiana have never attracted that many people, despite being long-standing institutions and offering a broader appeal. Ark Encounter would actually be less of an amusement park than an outdoor museum to a literal interpretation of the Bible, including the belief that the world was created in six days as recently as 6,000 years ago and that humans co-existed with dinosaurs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To attract 1.6 million visitors, the park — again, absent significant tourist facilities — would have to attract four times as many visitors as the nearby Creation Museum.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The record elsewhere is not encouraging. Bible Park USA, whose two proposals to build biblical-story parks in Tennessee were rejected, is exploring Southern Kentucky sites, also with state tax incentives. Holy Land USA, which opened in Virginia in 1972, closed in 2009. Holy Land Experience in Orlando, Fla., struggled with declining attendance and rising costs and debt until it was sold to the nation's largest religious broadcaster. It gets a little over 200,000 visitors a year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Indeed, the saturated theme-park market and the depressed economy make times tough for any new park. The most recent large amusement park, the Hard Rock Park in Myrtle Beach, S.C., closed five months after opening in 2008 and failed again the following year under new management, leaving investors, contractors and vendors in the lurch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's reality. It says that the extravagant expectations of the feasibility study Ken Ham's pal scribbled up (and which they are still keeping secret) are unlikely to be met, and yet another theme park with a very narrow focus is a poor investment. I know he's not used to dealing with facts, but other people are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don't care much about the economics. I'm more concerned that this is yet another effort to put together a giant exercise in miseducation for the state, where a small group of ignorant people are the recipients of large amounts of money that they use to lie to the public. The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2011/jan/18/noah-ark-insect-creationists-biblical-flood?CMP=twt_fd"&gt;Ark story is nonsense&lt;/a&gt;, it never happened and couldn't happened, and building expensive monuments to fairy tales sends a cracked and damaging message to the citizenry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/ken_ham_still_doesnt_get_it.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/HssngC2OUWw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295374524642"><id gr:original-id="http://davehubbleecology.blogspot.com/2011/01/bushbuck-two-species-where-there-was.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bd828923b8d25d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Bushbuck: two species where there was one</title><published>2011-01-18T10:35:21Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T10:35:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/cYa_pygY0bs/bushbuck-two-species-where-there-was.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://davehubbleecology.blogspot.com/2011/01/bushbuck-two-species-where-there-was.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Back in the day, the bushbuck was considered a single species, Tragelaphus scriptus, found in various habitats across much of sub-Saharan Africa. Recently however, genetic studies have indicated that T. scriptus is actually a complex of two distinct species, the Kéwel (T. scriptus) and the Imbabala (T. sylvaticus). This evidence shows that these two bushbuck species are more closely related to other tragelaphines than to each other; the Imbabala being closest to the Bongo (T. eurycerus) and Sitatunga (T. spekeii), and the Kéwel to the Nyala (T. angasii) (Moodley et al. 2009).The Kéwel is found from West Africa, across the Sahel into East Africa, and as far south as Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Meanwhile, the Imbabala is found from the Cape northwards to Angola, Zambia and East Africa, meaning that the two species’ ranges overlap in parts of Angola, DRC and East Africa. The Kéwel is the smaller of the two, and shows clear stripes and patterning on a reddish to yellowish background; there is little or no sexual dimorphism in this ground colour. In contrast, the Imbabala shows considerable colour variation with geography and habitat, especially in males (yellow to red-brown, through brown and olive to almost black), and only the most genetically ancient of populations (from Angola, Zambia, southern DRC, Botswana and northern Zimbabwe) have any significant striping. Even in these cases the horizontal stripe, where it exists, is formed of a series of spots rather than the solid striping of the Kéwel. never occurs. Mountain-dwelling forms of the Imbabala (Gregory Rift Highlands, Mt. Elgon, Imatong Mountains and Ethiopian Highlands) appear larger and are dark with little or no pattern. Until recently, most bushbuck studies focused on the Imbabala, hence little was known about the biology of the Kéwel beyond what could be obtained from museum specimens and hunting trophies.Imbalala bushbuck from Zimbabwe (courtesy of Graeme Guy). For a kewel image from The Gambia see here.Both species are primarily browsers, but will eat other plant matter too. They can be active at any time of day, although are more likely to be nocturnal near humans; their most active times are however early morning and parts of the night, so may appear nocturnal in any case. Most are solitary, with some living in pairs; all have a ‘home range’ of around 5 hectares in the savannah (larger in forests), although these ranges do overlap. Although the split into two species is fairly well understood (even if most non-scientific sources still refer to a single ‘bushbuck’), the more detailed taxonomy remains disputed with numerous potential subspecies and ecotypes having been described. For example, analysis of mt-DNA sequences (cytochrome b and control region) by Moodley &amp;amp; Bruford (2007) identified 23 phylogenetically distinct groups (‘ecotypes’) whose distribution correlated well with the pan-African eco-regions described by Olsen et al. (2001). 19 of these ecotypes corresponded with previously suggested subspecies, while six other haplotypes were newly recognized forms in the Volta region, Niger, Angola. and Luangwa and Zambesi Valleys. However, further research is onging to clarify the taxonomic status of bushbuck species, subspecies and ecotypes, so the situation is likely to remain somewhat fluid for a while – however, this does provide an opportunity to link the use of genetics in taxonomy to large-scale conservation in Africa, given the widespread distribution of bushbuck (in the broad sense) and apparent more local/region distribution of subspecies and ecotypes (Wronski 2009).ReferencesMoodley, Y. &amp;amp; Bruford, M.W.

Mr. Isis sent Little Isis to school, but after dinner Mr. Isis called Little Isis into the family room.  He told Little Isis that he wanted to show him a video and brought this up on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/PbUtL_0vAJk?fs%3D1%26hl%3Den_US&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Isis said, "I already saw this at school.  That's Martin Luther King."  Mr. Isis asked, "Who was Martin Luther King?" and Little Isis replied, "They told me that he was a black man  and he said that we always have to be kind to each other."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I had the opportunity to probe Little Isis further about this.  I asked him, "What does it mean to be a 'black man?'"  He replied, "I don't understand why they think Martin Luther King is a black man. He just looks like a man. I thought he would be black like my markers but then I saw his picture and he wasn't."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that he isn't able to comprehend that there might be a world where we treat each other differently based on what we look like and that soon...very soon...that reality is going to be changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2011/01/what_martin_luther_king_looks.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/fulxakq97ZE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295373871851"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2911">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/93b064f3831f8eb0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">More on linguistic politics in Tunisia</title><published>2011-01-18T17:44:48Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T17:44:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2911" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lameen Souag has posted a detailed analysis of "the language being used by the newly significant figures jockeying for power" in Tunisia ("&lt;a href="http://lughat.blogspot.com/2011/01/language-use-in-tunisian-politics.html"&gt;Language Use in Tunisian Politics&lt;/a&gt;",  Jabal al-Lughat, 1/17/2011).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295373721046"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=26873">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eeb4f90695ba458c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="illusion"/><category term="Cassini"/><category term="Dione"/><category term="Enceladus"/><category term="Saturn"/><title type="html">The more distant moon</title><published>2011-01-18T17:36:49Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T17:36:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/A1xsJPJ5fE8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/18/the-more-distant-moon/"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quick! Which of these two moons was closer to the Cassini spacecraft when it took &lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view/6661/Diones_Deception?js=1"&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ciclops.org/view_media/33794/Diones_Deception"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2011/01/cassini_dione_rhea.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="616"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to tell, isn’t it? Actually, it’s impossible to tell without knowing what’s what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gray moon to the upper right is Dione, and the blindingly white moon to the lower left is Enceladus (famed for its geysers of water erupting from its south pole). When I look at this picture, I can mentally swap the two moons in distance, making one seem farther away, then closer. It’s a bit like &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/11/05/this-illusion-will-drive-you-mad/"&gt;the Necker cube illusion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s a big hint: Dione is Saturn’s third largest moon at 1123 km (698 miles) across. Enceladus is comparatively small at 504 km (313 miles) in diameter. Since Dione is not twice the size of Enceladus in the picture, it must be farther away. In fact, Cassini was 510,000 km (317,000 miles) from Enceladus when it took this picture, but Dione was a more distant 830,000 km (516,000) — more than twice as far as our own Moon is from Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Dione is much duller and dimmer than Enceladus; its surface is rocky while ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/3i00hd7iomquf4dkhramao81dk/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fbadastronomy%2F2011%2F01%2F18%2Fthe-more-distant-moon%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~4/A1xsJPJ5fE8" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295373669410"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=50233">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/828b0138ceea531b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="health care"/><category term="medicine"/><title type="html">Sometimes the Cardio Ward Is Best</title><published>2011-01-18T18:00:43Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T18:00:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/8iYh9aNlVMQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/sometimes-the-cardio-ward-is-best/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A new study out of England finds that, for heart-failure patients, being admitted to the general ward instead of the cardiology ward can mean death: "Half the patients were admitted to cardiology wards.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogging and other Web activities have allowed members of many  marginalized communities to open previously locked media doors. But  women still rely more on back channels and ask for less help than men do  in the digital realm..For instance, comments posted to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/"&gt;The Intersection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; blog, co-authored by Sheril Kirshenbaum (@Sheril_) and Chris Mooney  (@ChrisMooney_), tend to come from men, Kirshenbaum said, but emails to  the blog authors typically come from women or children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Culturally, as women, we are less likely to speak out or argue,”  Kirshenbaum said, adding that women tend to create communities, and  mentor and co-market one another behind the scenes, rather than in more  public or traditional forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- And one of the most interesting moments -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A face-palm reaction rippled among the 20 or so mostly female attendees of the session when “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/"&gt;Not exactly rocket science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;”  blogger Ed Yong (@edyong209) said, “I suspect there is a bias in terms  of what is pushed to me through Twitter.” He explained that, although  other male writers often ask him to retweet links to their latest blog  posts, not a single such request has ever come from a woman writer.  Women in the room immediately broke into laughter, and commented about  the novelty and presumptuousness to them of such a practice. Said Yong,  “The fact that people haven’t done this speaks volumes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

YouTube has blocked embedding of the video, presumably because it came from ABC News, but you can see it &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5sMva2ydoU"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins gives the money quote when the interviewer presses him on how he sees Biblical accounts of creation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interviewer&lt;/em&gt;:  Genesis would lead us to believe that the earth is six thousand years old. And it would lead us to believe that God created two human beings—one out of the rib of the other.  It’s pretty explicit stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collins&lt;/em&gt;:  We &lt;em&gt;int&lt;/em&gt;erpret it as explicit these days.  &lt;em&gt;It is not a textbook of science&lt;/em&gt;!  It would not have suited God’s purposes to lecture to his chosen people about radioactive decay, and such things as DNA.  What God was trying to teach us through those words is the nature of God and the nature of humans—and that comes through loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit later, Collins asserts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . once you’ve accepted the idea of a God who is the creator of all the laws of nature, the idea that God might at unique moments of history might decide to invade the natural world, and suspend those laws,  doesn’t become, really, a logical problem.  And certainly the Resurrection is the most dramatic example of that:  where God became man, walked on this earth, was crucified, and then, after death, was resurrected—that, for me, is the cornerstone of my faith. And it doesn’t present a real problem, as a believer, as long as I’ve already acknowledged that God is God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is embarrassing stuff, even more so coming from America’s most prominent scientist.  Quick thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The correct translation of the frequent claim that “The Bible is not a textbook of science” is this: “The Bible is not literally true, except for those places where I say it’s literally true.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is Collins so sure that he knows what God intended when “writing” the Bible, especially since other Christian sects disagree?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Collins know exactly which parts of the Bible are “not science” (i.e., fiction) and which parts are?  If Genesis and Adam and Eve are “not science”, why is the Resurrection “science”?  There’s precisely the same amount of empirical evidence—i.e., zero—for each of these stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be delighted to get good answers to the last two questions.  Perhaps someone who agrees with Collins, like Uncle Karl Giberson, could weigh in here and explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;h/t: Moto&lt;/p&gt;

I sought out an ornithologist at Yale named Richard Prum in his office. As soon as I walked in, he promptly picked up a manila envelope from his desk. Out of it he drew what looked like the black wooden handle of a long paint brush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a quiz,” he said. “You tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A feather?” I guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a cassowary wing feather,” Prum said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassowaries are flightless birds that live in Australia and New Guinea. It was hard to imagine how the stick in Prum’s hand could belong to a bird, so he led me down a hallway to the Peabody Museum’s ornithology collection. We entered a room mostly taken up with white steel cabinets that reached up to the high ceilings. On a wall shelf stood an assortment of exotic stuffed birds. The turkey-sized cassowary was covered mostly in dark downy feathers. But on its wings were black paint brush handles, hanging down like a row of ebony icicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prum had more feathers to show off. He pulled open a cabinet drawer and drew ...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1295371896068"><id gr:original-id="http://blisstree.com/?p=215435">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8285a0ea0a193105</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="LIVE"/><category term="genetics"/><category term="ginger"/><category term="Natural Beauty"/><category term="natural fragrances"/><category term="natural remedies"/><category term="sleep"/><category term="smoking"/><title type="html">Morning Links: Smoking Damages DNA Within Minutes</title><published>2011-01-18T14:00:56Z</published><updated>2011-01-18T14:00:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blisstree.com/live/smoking-damages-dna/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="smoking" src="http://cdn.blisstree.com/files/2011/01/smoking.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="300"&gt;Ginger Could Relieve More Than Stomach Pains –&lt;/strong&gt; It could be a great natural remedy for &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/health/18really.html?src=me&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;sore muscles&lt;/a&gt;, too, thanks to naturally-occurring anti-inflammatories.

&lt;p&gt;I realize I say these things again and again and again, but they bear repeating because together they are a message that needs to be spread in as clear and unambiguous a form as possible. First, whenever you hear someone say, "I'm not anti-vaccine," there's always a "but" after it, and that "but" almost always demonstrates that the person is anti-vaccine after all. Second, for antivaccine loons, it's always about the vaccines. Always. It's not primarily about autism advocacy; it's primarily about the vaccines and blaming them for autism. Autism advocacy is either a secondary consideration subsumed to the needs of trying to convince people, against all science and reason, that vaccines cause autism, or anti-vaccinationists assume that anti-vaccine activism and autism advocacy are one in the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, just this morning, here is someone named Mary &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/01/nejm-article-perpetuates-distrust-by-mislabeling-victims-of-vaccine-adverse-reactions-antivaccinatio.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e20148c7bc6169970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e20148c7bc6169970c" rel="nofollow"&gt;commenting at AoA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is being called anti vaccine bad? I consider it like being called "informed, intelligent and free thinker." Call me anti vaccine all day and night, I LOVE it. Vaccines are a hoax.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Years ago, there had been discussion of the possibility that immediate post glacial climate in the North Atlantic coastal region was unusually warm, but the evidence was spotty.  Then, I was looking through material taken from a geotechnical boring placed to assess the geology of a part of Boston Harbor where a new tunnel was being planned, and found a large fragment of a clam embedded in clay.  The clay was deposited during the last glacial maximum and later, and was associated with the melting of glaciers in the region.  As a matter of routine, I gave it to Russell Barber, a mollusk expert and, at the time, my boss. He identified it as a species of razor clam found these days no farther north than the Carolinas.  And thus, yet another piece of spotty evidence!

Yarkoni's analysis of the paper is truly awesome, and worth a read if you are at all interested in research methodology (which means: nobody except for &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; researchers, and perhaps hopeless pedants like myself).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yarkoni's conclusion is in line with the impression I was already getting from reading other bloggers' and pundits' comments on the paper:  It's a good paper as far as it goes, even though the conclusions are almost certainly wrong.  (I differ from Yarkoni in the weight that I give to good ol' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_theorem"&gt;Thomas Bayes&lt;/a&gt; in rejecting the ESP hypothesis -- I frankly think that is the most important indicator of how we know this paper is wrong, and the rest is just a post mortem to determine &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; went wrong)  Bem has been admirably transparent and thorough in documenting what exactly he did.  As I've &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/psychic-paper-provokes-backlash/#comment-68975"&gt;written elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, that in many ways redeems the paper's publication, in that it provides the opportunity for a teaching moment in experimental design and what exactly can go wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The quote from Yarkoni with which I open this post is indubitably true from a research perspective, but in a broader societal context, it's highly disturbing.  No, I'm not criticizing Yarkoni; he's damn right, and that's exactly what is so disturbing about what he points out.  The public doesn't see it that way.  The popular press &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; doesn't see it that way.  For science journalists and the lay public, a single provocative paper published in a reputable journal (and even then, the public -- and to a certain extent I include myself in this -- is generally ignorant as to which journals are reputable) is as good as gospel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;What can be done about this?  Yarkoni is right, that if the only papers that got published were the ones which had a very high probability of being correct in their conclusions, it would entirely sabotage the scientific method.  In fact, pretty soon you wouldn't be able to publish &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; papers according to that criterion, because a big part of how certainty is achieved is via a long line of less certain research which all points to the same conclusion.  And in any case, many people -- including myself -- are increasingly of the opinion that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias"&gt;publication bias&lt;/a&gt; is a tremendous problem, resulting in large amounts of waste, as well as retarding the rate of science's natural self-corrective ability.  In that light, the last thing we want is to publish &lt;i&gt;fewer&lt;/i&gt; papers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most effective solution, I think, would be for science journalists to collectively behave more responsibly.  But good luck with that.  That's only slightly more likely than thinking the entire public is suddenly going to become more skeptical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is some hope -- as demonstrated by the recent evisceration of the NASA-funded paper into arsenic-based life forms, the blogosphere is increasingly flexing its muscles in order to keep that sort of credulous nonsense in check.  In the past, the blogosphere couldn't really be effective in that role, because even if a zillion science bloggers pointed out the flaws, they were only reaching a niche market of readers -- but now, enough noise in the blogosphere amounts to a news story in itself, one the mainstream media feels obligated to report on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a potential blueprint here:  Mainstream science journalists breathlessly report on the latest novel finding of public interest, as if one half-way decent p-value proves some controversial hypothesis beyond a shadow of a doubt; trained researchers blog about how the news stories are all full of shit and explain why the paper is either wrong or should be taken with a grain of salt; other interested bloggers link to and write about these criticisms, and in typical Interwubzian fashion, generate a lot of drama and heat in a short period of time; and finally, that becomes a story in itself, forcing those same mainstream science journalists to write articles playing down the earlier reports.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's far from a perfect system -- people will in general still remember the early credulous articles rather than the later more skeptical ones, and those with an agenda (Buy my supplements!  Don't vaccinate! &lt;a href="http://iranianredneck.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/religion-makes-you-unhealthy-poor-and-stupid/"&gt;Religion makes you live longer!&lt;/a&gt;) will cite the peer-reviewed-but-wrong papers for decades as if there was nothing wrong with them and they were never contradicted by later research.  But the sheer &lt;i&gt;noise&lt;/i&gt; the blogosphere is capable of generating, and in such a short time, I think makes the situation somewhat more promising than it has been in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, go back and read the quote from Yarkoni at the top of this post.  He's hit the nail on the head here.  This sort of thinking should be taught in grade school, and hammered away all through a person's education.  Science is messy, and by it's very nature it will frequently produce wrong results -- in fact it is this very embrace of uncertainty which gives science epistemological dominance over all other attempts to get at the truth.  We should neither discount science because of its dynamic and ever-changing character (for that is where its power lies!), nor should we assume that every proper application of the scientific method produces an unquestionable truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-4495326968559529406?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry></feed>
