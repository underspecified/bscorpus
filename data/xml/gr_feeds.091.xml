&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://breagrant.com/blog/life-of-brea/08/comic-news-insider-and-bad-astronomy/"&gt;Brea linked here on her blog&lt;/a&gt;!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make no apologies for being a fanboy, as I have a lot of lead time doing it (high school, if you must know, when I started going to scifi cons) and have built up a substantial amount of momentum. That’s why I thought it was so cool that actress &lt;a href="http://www.breagrant.com"&gt;Brea Grant&lt;/a&gt; (Heroes, Halloween 2) knew who I was. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/02/mysteries-of-the-cosmos/"&gt;I met her for the first time&lt;/a&gt; at the astronomy panel I moderated in Pasadena, and I was excited to find out she’d be at Comic Con. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took a few friends and me to a party hosted by Wired.com (I may have more on that at a later date) and agreed to go on camera for like one minute and let me be a dork. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thanks to her for being so cool. I had a lot of fun hanging with her and her brother (I got one of her CDs too; I traded a copy of my book for it). I hope they’ll be at Comic Con next year! &lt;/p&gt;

As part of a session on "Metaphors and Eggcorns," Sravana Reddy  (University of Chicago Dept. of Computer Science) delivered a paper entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W09/W09-2003.pdf"&gt;Understanding Eggcorns&lt;/a&gt;." Here's the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eggcorn is a type of linguistic error where a word is substituted with one that is &lt;i&gt;semantically plausible&lt;/i&gt; – that is, the substitution is a semantic reanalysis of what may be a rare, archaic, or otherwise opaque term. We build a system that, given the original word and its eggcorn form, ﬁnds a semantic path between the two. Based on these paths, we derive a typology that reﬂects the different classes of semantic reinterpretation underlying eggcorns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the supposedly secular public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a bad thing if all the schools bring in their local Southern Baptist minister to teach fundagelicalism…but it would be a great thing if the teachers brought a properly skeptical attitude towards it. Well, except for all the teacher lynchings that we&amp;#39;d be seeing around October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A correction from the &lt;a href="http://www.tfn.org/site/PageServer"&gt;Texas Freedom Network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note about your post on Bible classes in Texas public schools. Unfortunately, the article you linked to in your post got it wrong - public schools in Texas are NOT required to offer Bible courses. In fact, we were successful in 2007 in changing that bill in committee so that high schools could choose whether or not they want to offer elective courses about the Bible's influence in history and literature.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Texas attorney general has ruled that the law, as written, does require that something about the Bible's influence in history and literature must be in the curriculum somewhere, but it doesn't have to be a separate course. Of course, many social studies and literature classes have long included samples of sacred writings from Christianity and the other major religions and explain their influence on various cultures. So we don't think the law will change much unless school districts decide to offer separate Bible courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_look_forward_to_the_new_gene.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eeWu2Q5-CUQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250525237085"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/17/how-we-spend-our-time/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/479535b3933ec4a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humanity"/><title type="html">How We Spend Our Time</title><published>2009-08-17T16:06:57Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T16:06:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/17/how-we-spend-our-time/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Sleeping, working, and watching TV” is the short answer.  &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has increasingly been taking advantage of the powers of online presentation to offer some amazing interactive graphics, and last week they tackled &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html"&gt;how Americans over the age of 15 spend their typical days&lt;/a&gt;.  The overall most time-consuming activities were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping: 8 hours, 36 minutes per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working: 3 hours, 25 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV and Movies: 2 hours, 46 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Household activities: 1 hour, 46 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling: 1 hour, 12 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating: 1 hour 7 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Care: 47 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Leisure: 44 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socializing: 43 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is blogging, you ask?  “Computer use” (presumably non-work related) was down at 8 minutes per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they went way beyond that, to break it down by time of day and by demographics.  Various cheap shots suggest themselves, about how all that TV is rotting our brains, we’ve entered the late decadent period of our civilization, back in the old days everyone spent evenings composing piano sonatas and writing epic poetry, etc.  But I think it’s more interesting to simply appreciate the typical allocation of time during an average person’s day.  If you’re wondering about the short work day, a lot of people are pre-employment, post-employment, or just unemployed.  Also, “traveling” isn’t mostly about flying to Paris; it’s about commuting to work or school.  And sex falls under “personal care,”  but if you break out a separate category of “personal or private activities,” it adds up to 54 seconds per day.&lt;/p&gt;

It might also allow &amp;quot;genetic counselling&amp;quot; for parents concerned about their children&amp;#39;s risk of schizophrenia.Perhaps most importantly for psychiatrists, the definitive identification of genes for a mental illness would provide cast-iron proof that psychiatric disorders are &amp;quot;real diseases&amp;quot;, and that biological psychiatry is a branch of medicine like any other. Schizophrenia, generally thought of as the most purely &amp;quot;biological&amp;quot; of all mental disorders, is the best bet.With this in mind, let&amp;#39;s look at three articles (1,2,3) published in Nature last month to much excited fanfare along the lines of &amp;#39;Schizophrenia genes discovered!&amp;#39; All three were based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In a GWAS, you examine a huge number of genetic variants in the hope that some of them are associated with the disease or trait you&amp;#39;re interested in. Several hundred thousand variants per study is standard at the moment. This is the genetic equivalent of trying to find the person responsible for a crime by fingerprinting everyone in town.The Nature papers were based on three seperate large GWAS projects - the SGENE-plus, the MGS, and the ICS. In total, there were over 8,000 schizophrenia patients and 19,000 healthy controls in these studies - enormous samples by the standards of human genetics research, and large enough that if there were any common genetic variants with even a modest effect on schizophrenia risk, they would probably have found them.What did they find? On the face of it, not much. The MGS(1) &amp;quot;did not produce genome-wide significant findings...power was adequate in the European-ancestry sample to detect very common risk alleles (30–60% frequency) with genotypic relative risks of approximately 1.3 ...The results indicate that there are few or no single common loci with such large effects on risk.&amp;quot; In the SGENE-plus(2), likewise, &amp;quot;None of the markers gave P values smaller than our genome-wide significance threshold&amp;quot;.The ISC study(3) did find one significantly associated variant in the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6. The MHC is known to be involved in immune function. When the data from all three studies were pooled together, several variants in the same region were also found to be significantly associated with schizophrenia.Somewhat confusingly, all three papers did this pooling, although they each did it in slightly different ways - the only area in which all three analyses found a result was the MHC region. The SGENE team&amp;#39;s analysis, which was larger, also implicated two other, unrelated variants, which were not found in other two papers.To summarize, three very large studies found just one &amp;quot;schizophrenia gene&amp;quot; even after pooling their data. The variant, or possibly cluster of related ones, is presumably involved in the immune system. Although the authors of the Nature papers made much of this finding, the main news here is that there is at most one common variant which raises the relative risk of schizophrenia by even just 20%. Given that the baseline risk of schizophrenia is about 1%, there is at most one common gene which raises your risk to more than 1.2%. That&amp;#39;s it.So, what does this mean? There are three possibilites. First, it could be that schizophrenia genes are not &amp;quot;common&amp;quot;. This possibility is getting a lot of attention at the moment, thanks to a report from a few months back, Walsh et al, suggesting that some cases of schizophrenia are caused by just one rare, high-impact mutation, but a different mutation in each case. In other words, each case of schizophrenia could be genetically almost unique. GWAS studies would be unable to detect such effects.Second, there could be lots of common variants, each with an effect on risk so tiny that it wasn&amp;#39;t found even in these three large projects. The only way to identify them would be to do even bigger studies. The ISC team&amp;#39;s paper claims that this is true, on the basis of this graph: They took all of the variants which were more common in schizophrenics than in controls, even if they were only slightly more common, and totalled up the number of &amp;quot;slight risk&amp;quot; variants each person has.The graph shows that these &amp;quot;slight risk&amp;quot; markers were more common in people with schizophrenia from two entirely seperate studies, and are also more common in people with bipolar disorder, but were not associated with five medical illnesses like diabetes. This is an interesting result, but these variants must have such a tiny effect on risk that finding them would involve spending an awful lot of time (and money) for questionable benefit.The third and final possibility is that &amp;quot;schizophrenia&amp;quot; is just less genetic than most psychiatrists think, because the true causes of the disorder are not genetic, and/or because &amp;quot;schizophrenia&amp;quot; is an umbrella term for many different diseases with different causes. This possibility is not talked about much in respectable circles, but if genetics doesn&amp;#39;t start giving solid results soon, it may be.Purcell, S., &amp;amp; et Al (2009).

But, if the current proposals pass Congress, Americans may be looking at an even “weightier” problem. New economic research suggests that having health insurance actually makes people fat, and that, in turn, increases health care spending.

&lt;p&gt;In unrelated browses through the interwebs this morning, I came across two references to some high-priced gab fest called TED, whose slogan is “Ideas worth spreading”. Both the &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/08/aquatic-apes.html"&gt;Dish&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/node/2131"&gt; John Hawks&lt;/a&gt; link to this &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/elaine_morgan_says_we_evolved_from_aquatic_apes.html"&gt;talk at TED by Elaine Morgan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.aquaticape.org/"&gt;aquatic ape infamy (see Jim Moore’s website)&lt;/a&gt;. Whoever TED is, he may want to exercise a bit more quality control when selecting speakers. &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/pseudoscience/aquatic_ape_theory.html"&gt;John Hawks’ own take on aquatic apes&lt;/a&gt; is worth reading, and I particularly like his epitomization of what pseudoscience is; it’s spot on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the Aquatic Ape Theory fairly described as pseudoscience? Every statement of natural causes is &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; scientific. &lt;strong&gt;What distinguishes science from pseudoscience is social.&lt;/strong&gt; Pseudoscience is supported by assertions of authority, by rejection or ignorance of pertinent tests, by supporters who take on the trappings of scientific argument without accepting science’s basic rules of refutation and replication. Pseudoscience is driven by charismatic personalities who do not answer direct questions. When held by those in power, like Lysenkoism, it destroys honest scientific inquiry. When held by a minority, it pleads persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the Aquatic Ape Theory in 2009 fits the description. (&lt;strong&gt;emphasis&lt;/strong&gt; added)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/312887main_pia11798-516.jpg" width="500" title="Dusty solar panels can really put a grey damper on things." alt="312887main_pia11798-516.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a fortuitous, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/when_the_martian_winds_blow.php"&gt;powerful gust of wind knocked much of the dust off&lt;/a&gt;, boosting Opportunity's power by about 40%.  Because of this, Opportunity was able to continue making its way towards Endeavor crater -- the largest Martian crater that will ever be examined by any rover -- with an added power boost:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/772px-Endeavour_Crater_Annotated_2009-03-07.jpg" width="500" title="Opportunity&amp;#39;s route." alt="772px-Endeavour_Crater_Annotated_2009-03-07.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a few weeks ago, Opportunity was cruising along the Meridiani Planum when it passed this unusual-looking rock, named "Block Island":
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/375435main_mars20090731a-516.jpg" width="500" title="One of these rocks does not look like the others..." alt="375435main_mars20090731a-516.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at the pictures, the scientists working on the mission had determined that the rock was about two feet by one foot (the size of an old tombstone) with a bluish color to it.  So, back Opportunity went to take a closer look.  The findings?  This thing doesn't look like it comes from Mars:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/1249578498_17705-1_BlockIsland_VP_L257_full_br2.jpg" title="Block island, close up." width="512" alt="1249578498_17705-1_BlockIsland_VP_L257_full_br2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in fact, it &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt;.  It isn't made of the same stuff that Mars is made of, and members of the Opportunity team &lt;a href="http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20090810a.html"&gt;unequivocally state&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There's no question that it is an iron-nickel meteorite," said Ralf Gellert of the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.  "We already investigated several spots that showed elemental variations on the surface. This might tell us if and how the metal was altered since it landed on Mars."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There's plenty of evidence &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; than composition to back up the claim that this is a meteorite.  Take a close-up look at the patterns found in this rock:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/1M302457134IFFA5B8P2956M2F1_enh_br2.jpg" width="512" title="The triangular patterns are a dead giveaway." alt="1M302457134IFFA5B8P2956M2F1_enh_br2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See those triangular shapes?  Those shapes are smoking-gun evidence that this is a meteorite.  Not only do we see meteorites on Earth with those same patterns:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/fort_stockton_br2.jpg" width="512" title="This meteorite from Fort Stockton has the same triangular striations in it." alt="fort_stockton_br2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see those triangular shapes in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/tunguska_101_years_and_1_idiot.php"&gt;Tunguska fragments&lt;/a&gt; as well.  How did these patterns get exposed?
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Normally this pattern is exposed when the meteorite is cut, polished and etched with acid," said Tim McCoy, a rover team member from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. "Sometimes it shows up on the surface of meteorites that have been eroded by windblown sand in deserts, and that appears to be what we see with Block Island." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This makes Block Island the largest meteorite we've ever found on another planet, which is impressive in its own right.  But what we learn from this is even more impressive.  You see, Mars' atmosphere, the way it is right now, isn't thick enough to allow meteorites this large to land:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars/mars_atmosphere.jpg" width="500" title="Mars&amp;#39; atmosphere is only 0.7% as thick as Earth&amp;#39;s." alt="mars_atmosphere.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere is so thin that a meteorite this big would have hit the Martian surface at too great a speed, and would have broken apart from the impact.  What does this tell us (and the bold emphasis is mine)?
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Consideration of existing model results indicates &lt;b&gt;a meteorite this size requires a thicker atmosphere&lt;/b&gt;," said rover team member Matt Golombek of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. "Either Mars has hidden reserves of carbon-dioxide ice that can supply large amounts of carbon-dioxide gas into the atmosphere during warm periods of more recent climate cycles, or &lt;b&gt;Block Island fell billions of years ago&lt;/b&gt;." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That's right, this is more evidence that -- billions of years ago -- Mars had a thicker atmosphere.  This meteorite, which has theoretically been on the Martian surface for billions of years, could help unlock the secrets of the climate history on Mars.  As Albert Yen, another Opportunity scientist, says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;We're using this meteorite as a way to study Mars.  Before we drive away from Block Island, we intend to examine more targets on this rock where the images show variations in color and texture. We're looking to see how extensively the rock surface has been altered, which helps us understand the history of the Martian climate since it fell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Opportunity is only about 4 km into its 20 km journey from Victoria to Endeavor crater, and already it's discovered the largest extraterrestrial meteorite to date, complete with evidence for a denser, thicker atmosphere in Mars' past.  Remember, a denser, thicker atmosphere means &lt;i&gt;a past with liquid water&lt;/i&gt; on Mars, which may mean a distant past with life.  Not bad for a mission that started in January, 2004, with an expected life of 90 days!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/a_meteorite_on_mars.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250522767234"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8252148227113065308">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b8e698f94d48523</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Are Liberals &amp;quot;Intellectually Dishonest&amp;quot;?</title><published>2009-08-17T14:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T18:55:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/2ZUuP-bfafs/are-liberals-intellectually-dishonest.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8252148227113065308/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8252148227113065308" title="6 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/are-liberals-intellectually-dishonest.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">In the first comment below &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/jesus-james-dg-dunn-james-barr-and.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bruce the Agnostic&lt;/em&gt; asked me whether liberals are intellectually dishonest not to jump ship like I did, once they recognize there is no objective basis for Christianity. It was a good question that gave me pause. Do I think this? Yes I do, but let me explain.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How would you describe someone who undermines the objective basis for Christianity at every turn but then turns around and professes to be a Christian? I know, I know, the Christianity they profess isn't the one they deconstruct. I do think people are not honest with themselves. We probably all are to some degree about some things. We may think we're handsome or good at something when we're not. We may excuse our behavior and think we've done good things when deep inside we know we've done wrong. I think the intellectually honest thing to do is to abandon any profession of Christianity once it’s recognized that Jesus did no miracles, was wrong about the eschaton, didn’t fulfill OT prophecy, and did not bodily rise from the dead. I mean really, what does professing to be a Christian mean at that point when it’s recognized that Jesus was a failed doomsday prophet like a plethora of them have been who have come and gone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll tell you what I think. I think such a profession is merely to stay within a group, a group of people who do the same things, much like the Moose Lodge, the Elks, or Eagles at that point. Is this meaningful to people who profess such things? Yes. But there is no basis for doing so. Christianity becomes a mere label at that point which some people have applied to Americans as a whole: “I’m an America so I’m a Christian.” Is that meaningful? Again, yes, and it may be the true definition of a Christian since Christianity is a culture. All I’m doing is making a case and stating it in as forceful of a way as I can. Will liberals agree? No. But I want to force them to say that their version of Christianity is very far from anything that any Christian of the past would accept. &lt;strong&gt;The truth is that liberals did not arrive at their position by a process of abstract reasoning. No. They were forced into it against their preferences by the progress of the sciences.&lt;/strong&gt; I think they should just acknowledge that and admit they have cut themselves off from any historic understanding of what defines a Christian and then say, "but we like being with these people in this group because we like people."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8252148227113065308?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a soon to be published paper in the Royal Society’s &lt;a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/08/07/rsbl.2009.0532.abstract"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (abstract only), &lt;a href="http://www.upf.edu/bioevo/CV-CarlesLalueza.htm"&gt;Carles Lalueza-Fox&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.upf.edu/"&gt;Universitat Pompeu Fabra &lt;/a&gt;( website in Catalan!) in Barcelona and colleagues report that they have sequenced the gene &lt;em&gt;TAS2R38 &lt;/em&gt;from a &lt;a href="http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/humanorigins/history/neanderthals.php"&gt;Neanderthal man&lt;/a&gt; (press coverage by &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8195762.stm"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18obbitter.html?ref=science"&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;). The ability to &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/7124537/Neanderthal-Genetics-and-Phylogeny"&gt;sequence genes from fossil material&lt;/a&gt; is remarkable enough in itself, but this study has particular interest, and not just because it was done on one of our fossil relatives.  Variation in the gene they sequenced is responsible for the polymorphism in modern man for the ability to perceive bitter tastes (some people can tast bitter, some can’t). Determining the frequency of the two forms (or alleles) of the gene is a classic high school biology exercise, carried out by seeing who can taste the bitter chemical PTC.  People who have either one or two copies (humans are diploid, so most genes are present in each individual’s genome in two copies) of the taster allele can taste bitter; those with two copies of the non-taster allele cannot. Today, the two alleles are about equally frequent, so that about 25% of people have two taster alleles (i.e. they are homozygous for the taster allele), about 50% have one taster and one non-taster (they are heterozygotes), and 25% are homozygous for the non-taster allele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Neanderthal they sequenced was a heterozygote, and thus could taste bitter (and also [with sample of only 1, mind you] had the same allele frequencies as we do). The polymorphism thus goes back somewhere on the &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/51/19266.full.pdf+html"&gt;order of 40,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. But Neanderthals split from the lineage leading to modern humans on the order of &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/paabo09/paabo09_index.html"&gt;300,000 years ago, with little or no subsequent interbreeding&lt;/a&gt;. So the polymorphism probably goes back even further, predating the modern &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;/Neanderthal split. Although an exciting find, this is not a record for the antiquity of a modern polymorphism: some are known to &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v335/n6187/abs/335268a0.html"&gt;predate the human/chimp split&lt;/a&gt; (abstract only), and that’s millions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

(1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Staff concerns about safety at Mid Staffordshire trust were ‘lost in a black hole.’” (2) The evidence suggests that whistleblowers who report concerns are treated no better in the NHS now than at the time of the scandal at Bristol Royal Infirmary. (3) Medical leaders are responsible for the culture of silence. To become a medical leader one needs to compromise principles for expediency to meet the demands of politicians (in an organisation or government) with the power to advance or destroy a career. Medical leaders lack moral authority because few of them have taken the risk of speaking out on their way to the top. They are too often complicit in concealment of problems to protect their organisations or political masters.(4)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiona Godlee spoke at the conference and represented the BMJ.(1) The BMJ has removed from its website articles that have appeared in the paper journal purely to avoid the risk of the journal being sued for libel. The articles have not been retracted because there are no grounds for retraction of truthful reports. Does the BMJ want junior doctors to take the risk of losing their careers by speaking out when it is afraid of the financial cost of speaking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam Donaldson also spoke at the conference.(1) I have had correspondence and meetings with the chief medical officer to discuss misconduct by doctors, but I am left with the impression that he is unwilling or unable to act when the allegations involve senior medical leaders. Yet Sir Liam wants junior doctors to be brave enough to speak about problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The motivational speeches of medical leaders to junior doctors seem to be like the pep talks of generals to soldiers at the Somme before the troops went over the top and the leaders returned to their chateau for lunch. Medical leaders must now lead from the front and share the risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter T Wilmshurst&lt;br&gt;Consultant cardiologist&lt;br&gt;Royal Shrewsbury Hospital&lt;br&gt;Shrewsbury SY3 8XQ&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/08/consultation.html"&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/08/weetman-chair-of-medical-schools.html"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/"&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/30682564-1183883511857033099?l=scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Aubrey Blumsohn)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog</id><title type="html">Scientific Misconduct Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250519381105"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=16633">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1951959ed6baa2e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="food"/><title type="html">Where the Real Chinese Food Is Hidden</title><published>2009-08-17T14:04:57Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T14:04:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/where-the-real-chinese-food-is-hidden/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Jason Kuznicki at Positive Liberty offers some hypotheses as to why Chinese restaurants have "secret menus" that only Chinese people seem to know about.</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250519015511"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Mikereinold/~3/G2NteqYNkwg/is-throwing-curveball-dangerous-to-our.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71aac5de7c75577d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Is Throwing a Curveball Dangerous to our Youth Baseball Pitchers?</title><published>2009-08-17T06:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T06:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/1zKeawI1fyI/is-throwing-curveball-dangerous-to-our.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Mikereinold/~3/G2NteqYNkwg/is-throwing-curveball-dangerous-to-our.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">    Over the last few weeks, there has been some debate regarding the release of two recent studies that showed that curveballs may not be as damaging to our youth baseball pitchers as we had once thought.  I tried to let this die down a bit before discussing it, as the general press really picked up on this and started a debate with absolutely no medical background.  The New York Times discussed this recently and  I even saw a couple of sportscasters on ESPN discussing this on TV.  A lot of people have flat out disagreed with these studies, but consider the following:     Both studies, from two different institutions here and here from AJSM in 2008 and 2009, showed that the curveball does not increase force on the throwing arm in comparison to a fastball.  One of these studies was from the prestigious American Sports Medicine Institute who were the leaders in learned the majority of what we know about throwing mechanics.     Notice how they don’t say that throwing a curveball is safe or does not cause injuries.    These are simply biomechanical studies.  But lets take a step back and think about this, maybe they are right.  Maybe curveballs are safe?  Consider the argument from the perspective of the scientist, clinician, pitching coach, and the player:     Pitching is really just a physics equation, force = mass x acceleration, right?  Force = injury.  So if the mass of the ball and the acceleration of the arm are similar, why would we expect force to be higher?  This is purely the scientific thought process.  Taking this to the next step, the angular velocity of the arm during a curveball is slower than a fastball, hence the studies that show lower force on the body.     Clinically, I would say that because the forearm position is different between the curveball and fastball, that there could be consequences.  The static stabilizers (the bones, joint, and ligaments) are the same, but alter the forearm position alters the position of the forearm muscles and potentially decreases the mechanical advantage of the dynamic stabilizers (the muscles) to protect the elbow.  So the curveball will have the same force, yes, but may be less able to stabilize to protect the arm.  This may increase the incidence of injury.     The next thing to consider is youth mechanics.  My bet would be that if we studied this, there would many youth that are not taught the correct mechanics to throw a curveball, this would certainly increase injury risk.     From the player perspective, one thing is certain: A Little League pitcher that can throw an effective curveball is going to be good, they are going to then throw a lot, and they have a high chance of being abused.  It has been proven in a couple of other studies here and here that one of the highest predictors of injury in Little League pitchers is the amount of pitching that they perform, or they abuse that they endure.    I think it is definitely still a good recommendation to limit the development of a curveball in our youth baseball players, I would still say that pitchers who throw a curveball are more susceptible to injury due to the above rationale, but the curveball itself may not be as evil as once thought.  Bottom line, teach your kids how to throw an effective fastball and changeup and stick to the recommended pitch count restrictions in youth baseball.  Locating strikes and changing speeds will be just as effective in Little League baseball and a changeup has actually been show to be LESS forceful on the throwing arm.  As they mature, both physically and mechanically, learn to develop more advanced pitching.    Dr. Andrews summarized this best in the NY Times article:      “It may do more harm than good — quote me on that,” Andrews said during an interview in his Birmingham clinic. He fears that parents and coaches may interpret the findings improperly, as a license to teach kids to throw too many curves or begin when they are too young. “There are still some unknown questions.”         Photo by Wildernice     Dun S, Loftice J, Fleisig GS, Kingsley D, &amp;amp; Andrews JR (2008).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salutations Rogues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been absorbed in your podcast since my brother recommended it to me in January 20009. It made me realize why I never felt completely comfortable with the natural remedies and new age thinking that members of my family and friends firmly believed in. You have opened my eyes and made my brother and I closer than ever because we now know who we are. We are skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a graphic designer by trade so in my gratitude to the Rogues and in honor of Perry (who I am only now getting to know because for some reason I have been listening to the back catalogue in reverse order) I made you a present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Rogues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/boston_land_ofcreationists.php"&gt;I mentioned&lt;/a&gt;, there was a lecture by a Scientist with a Ph.D. in Science from Harvard on Sunday, by a fellow named Dr Nathaniel Jeanson, which is part of a fairly typical trend nowadays: the devout creationist who grinds his way through a graduate program to earn an advanced degree so he can disregard everything he learned to wave his title like a victory flag and pretend to an authority he does not have. Other well-known examples are Jonathan Wells and Marcus Ross — their degrees are meaningless since they clearly prioritize the trappings of authority over the substance of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Jeff Eyges attended and sent in a summary. It's no surprise: Jeanson has this fancy degree, but his talk was all straight out of the quaint old 1960s "Scientific Creationism" handbook, full of bogus arguments and obfuscatory handwaving over science the speaker doesn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I told Catherine Dulac, his former dept. head at Harvard, it was an hour-long spectacle of misinformation, half-truths and what appeared to be deliberate obfuscation. Most of this (probably all of it) you've heard before. He began by contrasting Evolutionary Theory and Creationism. Evolution, he said, admits only naturalistic explanations, discounts eyewitness testimony (i.e., the Bible) and insists upon uniformitarianism. Naturally, he sees these as weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then listed the similarities; strangely he listed speciation (I thought they didn't even like the word) under "Microevolution". He then pulled out what I imagine was the most nihilistic quote by a scientist (regrettably, I didn't write down the name) he could find, to the effect that evolution demonstrates that there is no purpose to life, no ethics, no free will, etc. He did say that not all atheists have this view, but, of course, it was calculated to appeal to the Christians in the audience; they gasped and shook their heads appropriately (I should mention that the event was sponsored by an evangelical church; yes, we have a few in Boston!). They were primed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then began to weave tortuous arguments from geology and astronomy, disciplines in which he apparently has no training and upon which he isn't qualified to draw (I'm not sure he's qualified to draw upon biology). Astronomy - the galaxies are positioned at discrete distances from the Earth, in all directions, which is what you'd expect to see if we were at the center. Geology - the basalt layer on the sea floor, coupled with the ion exchange cycle, only allows for an age of 62 million years. The mud flow process allows for only 12 million years. The inconsistency shows the unreliability of the evolutionary model. Radiometric dating is, of course, unreliable as well. For uranium to decay into lead takes 1.5 billion years, however, helium retention (apparently, zircon crystals containing lead that decayed from uranium have also contained helium; YEC's claim that over millions of years, the helium would have escaped) would indicate an age of 6,000 years. Not only does this demonstrate the inconsistency of the old-Earth model, but it serves to validate the chronology of the young-Earth model (because, of course, when the methodology supports our a priori conclusions, we accept it!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then dealt with the geological strata. He talked about layers in the area around Mt. St. Helens, along with peat, as a possible precursor of oil, at the bottom of a lake that has since formed, and opined that similar activity with greater force, multiplied many times, occurred during the Flood. He quoted one of his new colleagues at ICR (he quoted them quite a bit, actually) as saying that the Earth doesn't look old; it looks flooded!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then got around to Biology. According to him, biologists admit that abiogenesis is the "worst" problem as regards evolution. Also (and you can hear this coming) - there are few, if any, transitional forms, and they've been looking for decades. (I was surprised he even allowed for the possibility of "a few"; I'm not sure what he meant.) Finally, of course - irreducible complexity. He drew upon his own doctoral work on calcium regulation in the blood, as well as bacterial flagella and blood clotting. Naturally, he neglected to mention the refutations of IR that have been in circulation since before Dover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he got into some very weird territory. He gave a brief description, for the sake of the lay churchgoers, of DNA, RNA and proteins, and then put up a chart giving the degree of similarity in Cytochrome C sequencing between organisms, expressed as percentages. He drew attention to the fact that the degree of similarity between yeast (for example) and humans is the same as that between yeast and plants, and that this is true across the board for all organisms. David Levin, a professor of Molecular Biology from Boston University was there, and, as both you and he subsequently explained to me, Cytochrome C is an extremely old gene, and we would therefore expect the sequences to be the same for all organisms. The strange thing is that each organism had a different figure assigned to it - yeast was 39% similar to all other organisms; others had different figures - so I really don't understand what he was trying to say. He then plotted the figures on pyramids, and said something along the lines of requiring geometric shapes of increasingly higher dimensions to express it properly. I told Dr. Levin, "I couldn't understand what that was all about." He told me it was deliberate obfuscation, and I said, "Thanks, that's what I thought!" As I said, it was all very strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeanson ended by attempting to use his take on creation "science" as justification for his conservative Christian theology - the evidence points to a creation made specifically for us; the reasonable response is one of gratitude and praising the creator, who is then within his rights to manifest just wrath over our not praising him and expressing gratitude. Although I'm 52 and have been observing it all of my life, the fact that they don't see this as a projection of their own damaged egos and a product of their pathologically low self-esteem still floors me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a half-hour lunch break, then an hour-long Q &amp;amp; A. Most of the church folk had left, but a few remained, along with several scientists and science-oriented people. Dr. Levin began by bringing up the genomic data, describing it as a problem in logic for which the only answer is common descent. Jeanson claimed to be unfamiliar with the data! (I&amp;#39;d think even an undergraduate Biology student would be familiar with it at this point; I&amp;#39;m hard-pressed to understand how a recent PhD grad - from Harvard, no less - doesn&amp;#39;t know about it.) Levin offered to get up and give a five minute presentation; Jeanson wasn&amp;#39;t interested. The chimpanzee genome came up as well; Jeanson said he thought it was based upon the human data and incomplete at that; Levin told him that wasn&amp;#39;t the case, that we have the complete genome and have had it for some time. He also mentioned tree ring dendrology, that we have specimens going back 11,000 years. Again, Jeanson said he wasn&amp;#39;t familiar with it. He ended up saying that a good deal; apparently, there wasn&amp;#39;t too much data with which he was familiar! At that point, a man stood up, agitated, said he was a doctor and that he&amp;#39;d been a Christian for thirty years, that he converted because of the &amp;quot;differing opinions&amp;quot; about evolutionary theory, and started going off the deep end about the inconsistencies in carbon dating and how it related to tree ring dendrology. Dr. Levin, who was a model of patience and restraint, told him that it was irrelevant; the tree ring data is used to calibrate carbon dating, but is obviously independent of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other people brought up similar issues, forcing Jeanson to back down on a couple of points. One fellow challenged him on irreducible complexity, and got him to admit it&amp;#39;s really just a semantic device, that it doesn&amp;#39;t serve as evidence for creation. The fellow asked, &amp;quot;Then why include it in your talk?&amp;quot; Jeanson had no answer. He was also pressed about the Cytochrome C similarities, and acknowledged that it actually did support common ancestry. A young woman noted that he had no problem questioning the opinions of scientists, but that he seemed unwilling to question the Bible, which was written by poorly educated men 2,500 - 3,000 years ago. He replied that he&amp;#39;d studied the Bible extensively, had found it to be reliable and consistent, and that when he&amp;#39;d thought he&amp;#39;d found an inconsistency, it turned out to be the result of his own &amp;quot;wrong thinking&amp;quot; (His mental processes would appear to mimic the scientific process, in that they seem to be self-correcting!). He also began using the word &amp;quot;paradigm&amp;quot; repeatedly, which made me think of Marcus Ross; it&amp;#39;s the term he uses to sidestep his critics. In fact, that&amp;#39;s what the Q &amp;amp; A consisted largely of - Jeanson avoiding direct confrontation and claiming ignorance of data. My perception was that the whole thing was making him uncomfortable, but I&amp;#39;d hate to think that in five years, no one at Harvard confronted him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were numerous challenges, and, toward the end, the Christians started to get a little feisty as they felt increasingly threatened - Bible quotes, atheism leads to Nazism, that sort of thing. All in all, though, it was rather tame. As we were leaving, Dr. Levin was engaged by a couple of fundies. They said God created the trees with rings to make it look as though they were old; he suggested that made God a deceiver. No, no, he's given you free will; you have a choice... the same tired apologetics. On the one hand, God hides himself enough so that we have to have faith, on the other, he gives us enough evidence so that we are without excuse and he's justified in holding us "accountable". And, of course, it doesn't matter whether or not we think it's "fair" - he's God; he can do whatever he likes! It's like arguing with very stubborn, developmentally challenged children (which, as I suggest from time to time on Pharyngula and Ed Brayton's blog, is how I feel they should be treated). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I came home and wrote an email to Dr. Dulac, the Chair of the Dept. of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard. I'm absolutely appalled that this young man, who disavows a century and a half of empirical data and repudiates the basic principles of science, was given a PhD by one of the most prestigious universities in the country. First Kurt Wise, now this kid. As I told Dr. Levin, "One is an anomaly. Two is already becoming a habit!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another &lt;a href="http://bostonatheists.blogspot.com/2009/08/report-on-nathaniel-jeansons.html"&gt;account from the Boston Atheists&lt;/a&gt;. Jeanson is same ol', same ol'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what we need everytime one of these frauds speaks: a mob of skeptics to descend upon it and shred it publicly and on the web.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/a_first-hand_report_of_nathani.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/NMGIXr3xMU0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250516668362"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/150_years_of_continual_discove.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a23f79df80de7b22</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">150 Years of Continual Discoveries</title><published>2009-08-17T13:20:56Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T13:20:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/q79exNHheps/150_years_of_continual_discove.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/150_years_of_continual_discove.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/upload/2009/04/book_review_remarkable_creatur/remarkable-creatures-sean-carroll-hardcover-cover-art.jpg" width="168" height="254"&gt;Sean B. Carroll's latest book has been sitting on my reading shelf (and been read by my wife) for over four months, but now I've finally read it. &lt;i&gt;Remarkable Creatures&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of mini-biographies of people who have made important discoveries in evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't mention names, but we've got both of the scientists who discovered evolution, the guy who discovered mimicry, the man who found the first &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt; fossils on Java, the man who discovered the Cambrian Burgess shale with its soft-part fossils, the man who found the first dinosaur nests, the father and son team that figured out that the Cretaceous ended with an asteroid impact, the man who convinced paleontologists that birds are theropod dinosaurs, the man who found a fossil leggèd fish and named it Tiktaalik, the couple who finally focused hominid palaeontology's attention on Africa, the man who got two Nobels and invented the molecular clock, and the people who applied it to Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a fan of Stephen Jay Gould I had read before about several of the earlier figures covered here. I could see that Carroll has left out some of the less flattering or simply weird bits of their intellectual biographies. But still, his book was an enjoyable read, very much focused on the adventurous side of making important discoveries and making sense of them. Its sub-title is "Epic adventures in the search for the origins of species". The later half of the book held a lot of news for me, and I enjoyed it a lot, especially since we are shown how the work of each scholar built upon that of the forerunners. There's an extensive bibliography and an index, and so the book will work well for reference purposes and as an entry point for further reading. But anyone with a bit of intellectual curiosity may simply read it for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/04/book_review_remarkable_creatur.php"&gt;longer review&lt;/a&gt;, check out Brian Switek's at &lt;i&gt;Laelaps&lt;/i&gt; from back in April.

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had some wins and losses in the past year for skepticism. Some of these — on both sides — have been pretty big. Two of our big losses, for example, were Simon Singh’s denial of his appeal to overturn an absurd UK libel ruling, and the firing of Chris Comer who did the horrifying act of trying to alert people about a science talk in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the news may yet turn around for our two allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Simon &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/390"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; he will go for an oral reconsideration of his denial of appeal. Initially, he submitted a &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt; application for the court to reconsider its findings about his libel case (where the British Chiropractic Association is suing him over his use of the word &amp;quot;bogus&amp;quot; in reference to the quackeriffic aspects of chiropractic), and that was turned down. An oral appeal is allowed, &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/08/simon-soldiers-on.html"&gt;and that will happen on October 14&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right after &lt;a href="http://www.tamlondon.org"&gt;TAM London&lt;/a&gt;, and I just bet Simon will have something to say at that meeting. Well, what he’s legally allowed to say, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Chris Comer’s case is a bit older, so &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/29/texas-so-so-doomed/"&gt;to refresh your memory&lt;/a&gt;: in November 2007 she worked (note the tense) for the Texas Education Agency (TEA). She received an email announcing a talk by the wonderful &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/12/heroes-of-dover/"&gt;Barbara Forrest&lt;/a&gt;, the topic of which was the Dover creationism trial and other encroachments of religion on science. Comer, noting that a lot of the people she knows would be interested in such a talk, forwarded the email to her colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TEA then fired her, saying Comer abused her position at TEA to promote an anti-religious stance. It was a ridiculous accusation and &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; a political move, but they tried to cover their butts by saying they have to remain neutral on matters of religion versus science. Note that this is the Texas &lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt; Agency. They have to remain neutral on the truth? What the &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Comer filed suit against the TEA saying this neutrality policy is actually a violation of the First Amendment, but a judge ruled against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: remind me to never, ever break a law in Texas. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the cool news is that &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/08/chris-comer-appeals-004994"&gt;Ms. Comer is appealing the decision&lt;/a&gt;. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch a short video about all this courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpCdQ2Tbf6s"&gt;the National Center for Science Education’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad to see both these skeptics are not going down without a fight. The forces of evil lurk around every corner, and we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; continue to rail and rally against them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250515198510"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8862">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2046ecfcda3324a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 8.17</title><published>2009-08-17T13:08:02Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T13:08:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8862" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a partial list of false or misleading things Jerry Coyne says about my book &lt;em&gt;The Evolution of God&lt;/em&gt; in his &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/booksarts/story.html?id=8874be1e-16db-43db-bda5-17ac7af196d0&amp;amp;p=1"&gt;review of it&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;. I want to emphasize that I think these are innocent mistakes. I have no reason to believe he intentionally misrepresented my argument. Indeed, his errors are of a kind that most of us have committed under deadline pressure or under the influence of deep intellectual passions. Nonetheless, his misrepresentations are collectively significant, because together they form the foundation of most of his criticism of my book. Once you correct them, his critique basically collapses. If Coyne wants to write a devastating review of my book—and there can be little doubt that he wants to—he’s going to have to start over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to read Wright’s &lt;a href="http://evolutionofgod.net/coyne"&gt;full description&lt;/a&gt; of how Coyne has gotten him wrong–and then compare with our &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/some-more-words-to-the-new-atheist-blogosphere-on-unscientific-america/"&gt;own documentation&lt;/a&gt; of how Coyne has “strongly misstated our views” in his first (online) review of &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250512963507"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=784">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5148f013c5e350e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">H1N1 Vaccine and GBS</title><published>2009-08-17T12:29:08Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T12:29:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=784" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As most people have probably heard by now, we are in the midst of a pandemic – swine flu or H1N1. This is a strain of the Influenza A virus, which causes a severe respiratory infection. The virus evolves rapidly and each year new strains appear, causing the annual flu season which causes 30,000 deaths in the US and 500,000 world wide.  (The H and N refer to the two main proteins used to classify different strains of the virus – I wrote a more &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=529"&gt;detailed summary here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the current pandemic is being caused by an H1N1 strain, the same strain that caused the 1918-1919 pandemic that killed millions, world health organizations are understandably concerned and they are tracking it carefully. There are also efforts underway to develop a vaccine. This further raises concerns because of the 1976 H1N1 pandemic – the vaccine given for that strain was linked to cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome – GBS. Unfortunately, while the likely risk of GBS is much smaller than the risk from the flu itself, this risk has stoked the flames of fear-mongering about vaccines. This somewhat irresponsible &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1206807/Swine-flu-jab-link-killer-nerve-disease-Leaked-letter-reveals-concern-neurologists-25-deaths-America.html"&gt;article in the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; is a good example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBS is an autoimmune neurological disorder. It is a monophasic (one time process that gets worse then gets better) post-infectious illness. Essentially, an infection with a virus or bacteria triggers the immune system to have a second inflammatory response against myelin proteins. Myelin is the insulation around nerves – the inflammation inhibits nerve conduction, damages the myelin, and when severe can damage the underlying nerve fiber itself. This results in weakness, numbness, and autonomic dysfunction. The weakness, when very severe, can inhibit breathing resulting in the need for mechanical ventilation. Right now the greatest risk from the disease is the autonomic dysfunction which can cause a severe drop in blood pressure, among other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If recognized early and treated properly, most patients with GBS have a short illness – days to weeks – and recover nearly fully. However, severe or untreated cases can result in permanent paralysis and there is a 3-4% death rate. (Although I have treated many cases, I have never seen a death from GBS – not even close. I suspect these cases result from a significant delay in treatment or improper treatment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBS can not only be triggered by the flu or other infections, but also by vaccines used to prevent infections. This is because vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system, to provoke an immune response – which is what causes GBS. The risk of getting GBS from the flu vaccine is about 1 in a million. This is very reliable data, as we have been using the same basic technology for the flu vaccine for decades and we have reliable statistics on GBS as treatment requires hospitalization. Some cases may be missed if they are very mild (probably rare, but also if a case is too mild to be recognized then who cares) or from misdiagnosis (also probably rare as it is fairly easy to eventually confirm the diagnosis even if it may be difficult initially).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, GBS does not affect the brain (as the Daily Mail incorrectly reported) but only the peripheral nerves. Occasionally the spinal cord may also be affected, but generally speaking GBS is a peripheral disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H1N1 Flu Vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we gear up for the H1N1 flu vaccine there is much fear-mongering among the antivaccinationists, the usual conspiracy theorists and critics (usually competitors) with science-based medicine. The Daily Mail piece, unfortunately, plays into this fear mongering while burying any reasonable responses from scientists deep within the article. The reason the GBS concern is raised is because in 1976 the H1N1 or swine flu vaccine triggered a GBS outbreak, and it is estimated that about &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/vaccine_preparedness/safety_approval/en/index.html"&gt;10 in a million recipients&lt;/a&gt; came down with GBS. It also turns out that the 1976 pandemic fizzled, and turned out to be very mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine uses the same basic technology that has been used for decades, and therefore it is very reliable and the risks are fairly well known. Each year the vaccine has to be tweaked to target the likely strains of Influenza A that will be prominent that year. So the risks from the vaccine may vary slightly as new strains are being targeted, but over the last 30 years since the 1976 episode the risk of GBS has been steady at about 1 in a million – far less than the risk of the flu itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the accusation that the upcoming H1N1 flu vaccine is untested is not a fair or accurate statement. It is highly tested. But it is true that the particular strains targeted will be new. Some charge that therefore vaccinating the public will amount to a large “guinea pig” experiment. This is a naive and misleading statement, however. The fact is that every single medical intervention, every new drug on the market, is in the same situation. Even if we highly test a new drug or treatment in thousands of subjects, it may be marketed to millions. We cannot possibly know the statistical effects on millions of people until it happens. There is therefore nothing different about the H1N1 vaccine from any other mass medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, our experience is even greater because we have decades of experience vaccinating millions of people with very similar vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even still, it makes sense to track new interventions  – to gather data about what happens when millions are treated. For that reason the British National Health Service has apparently asked neurologists to report new cases of GBS starting this summer. They want to establish a baseline rate of GBS using this reporting system so that if there is a spike of GBS following the H1N1 flu vaccine they will pick it up quickly and can make recommendations about whether or not to continue the vaccine or abort it. This makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Daily Mail is using this precautionary measure to scaremonger about the safety of the vaccine. This is like using the presence of seat-belts in cars to scaremonger about their safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcoming H1N1 vaccine is simply the regular flu vaccine targeted against the H1N1 proteins to cover the current pandemic strain. Because the pandemic will likely come in two waves, and we are between them right now, this gives us the opportunity to create a vaccine specific for the pandemic strain – rather than guessing, as we do each year for the regular flu season. We have a great deal of information about the safety of this vaccine, but it is always reasonable to track safety going forward. We also have a lot of information about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine – it is very effective. The vaccine itself is very effective, but the actual effectiveness each year varies from 60-80% depending upon whether or not the proper strains were targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of GBS from the flu vaccine has been around 1 in a million – a very rare complication. The risk may not be any higher for the H1N1 vaccine. It is actually not known why the 1976 vaccine had a higher rate of GBS, but it has not been repeated in the last 30 years. Perhaps there is something about H1N1 that increases the risk of GBS, and for this reason monitoring GBS as the vaccine is administered is reasonable. So far, in preliminary tests of thousands of individuals with the new vaccine there has not been any increased risk of GBS, but this process in ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no absolute guarantees in medicine – but the best evidence we have to date strongly suggests that the risk of the H1N1 flu is likely to be much greater than the risk of the vaccine itself. And the usual safety measures and testing are in place – in fact there is heightened safety monitoring. Medicine is a risk vs benefit assessment. But it is easy to fear monger by focusing only on the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

They are, as anyone who is even vaguely familiar with the laws of thermodynamics and conservation is aware, impossible. The bottom line is that there is no way to create a machine that creates energy from nothing. Energy always has to come from somewhere, and at least a little bit of energy has to be wasted in any process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, listener Karen Clow (rhymes with “flow”) asks this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just listened to your 5×5 episode about perpetual motion, and I have a  question.  While I haven’t been able to find it on YouTube, I saw a video a few  months ago that seemed like a form of perpetual motion.  There was a column of  marbles in the center, and the structure holding the column was slightly wider  than the marbles so that instead of a straight-up stack, they rested on top of  one another in a sort of zig-zag pattern.  There was a “track” of sorts starting  form the top of the column, so that a marble went down the track, and when it  reached the bottom, it went into the bottom of the column, forcing the column  up, causing the top marble to go down the track.  I don’t recall anyone claiming  that this was perpetual motion in the traditional sense, it was more of a  “kinetic art” thing (although searching for kinetic art I can only find pieces  which use motors).  I also realize that there would be no way to harness the  energy of the marbles, since any attempt to do so would cause them to slow down  enough that they wouldn’t have enough inertia to force the column upwards.  Is  my memory of this invention flawed?  Is such a thing possible, and if so, would  it not be considered perpetual motion?  Sorry if this is a hoax that’s been  debunked a hundred times over, but nothing about it seemed to be an attempted  hoax, it was more of a curiosity like a fountain but with marbles instead of  water, so I’m really curious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;These types of machines are not the free energy machines that we were talking about.  As Karen points out, they cannot be used to generate energy. If you try to take energy out of the system it will quickly wind down. But can you make a machine that is energy neutral – meaning that it does not create energy but it does not lose energy either, so it can continue indefinitely – perpetual motion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one such device: &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/us7YB7eiOeQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to this type of perpetual motion is to eliminate all sources of energy loss – usually friction. Imagine the earth revolving about the sun – this is a type of perpetual, or at least very long-lived, motion. There is little friction is space and the momentum of the earth is precisely balanced by the gravitational force of the earth-sun system so that it is very stable. It is probably more accurate to describe this as a very stable system, rather than perpetual motion, but billions of years is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On earth it is more difficult to create a micro-friction situation. A rolling marble makes noise; that noise represents vibrating air molecules, which takes energy. Therefore noise is carrying energy away from the system. There is also friction with the air, and vibrations in the machine itself. So while a precisely engineered machine may minimize friction and other subtle energy losses, it cannot eliminate it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore most of these perpetual motion machines use another trick to simulate true perpetual motion – they are tapping into a subtle source of energy to replace the slight loss in the system. These are often very clever. Magnets may be used to give a ferromagnetic component a subtle push, just enough to replace losses due to friction. Of course, this takes energy away from the magnet which will eventually wear down. It seems like the machine above may be using magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that machine also has pendulums. It is therefore possible that energy could be borrowed from the rotation of the earth, which would make free swinging pendulums rotate around (ala &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum"&gt;Foucault&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also heard of a clock that is wound by the expansion and contraction of various metals in the spring from the daily cycle of heating and cooling in the room. Watches that wind by the motion of the wearer are now old hat, but that is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, there is lots of usable energy in the environment. If you could tap into some source of energy, even if it is slight, it can potentially keep a precise system going indefinitely (as long as the conditions and materials remain stable). On a large scale such systems may even be used to generate usable energy. I have heard plans for sidewalks that derive energy from the people walking on them, or piezoelectrical systems that generate electricity from the energy of raindrops falling on them. In the new era of supposed green energy, most people have probably seen proposals for generating energy from ocean waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fun to think about the ultimate sources of energy on the earth – mainly solar, nuclear and geothermal. The sun heats the surface of the earth putting a lot of energy into the system, which causes the wind to blow, runs waterfalls, and gives energy to plants (the ultimate source of all fossil fuel energy). Radioactive minerals provide energy through nuclear reactors. And the earth itself is very hot beneath the surface – energy deriving from all the collisions that formed the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another potential source of energy – the gravity of the moon and sun, which cause tides, which could be tapped for energy. There are also many sources of chemical energy, although I am not sure how much of that derives from other sources like solar and geothermal. And naturally occurring magnets have energy, but again I am not sure where they ultimately get their energy from – from the collisions that made them or from the supernova that formed the elements themselves (which is the ultimate source of nuclear energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have probably missed something. If you can think of any other ultimate sources of energy that we could potentially tap into, let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250508620291"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2009/08/sunday-protist-streblomastix-intestinal.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/98ca8020f90632de</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sunday Protist - Streblomastix: intestinal torpedo-bearing sub</title><published>2009-08-17T05:22:03Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T05:22:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/3-hcfeaAgic/sunday-protist-streblomastix-intestinal.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2009/08/sunday-protist-streblomastix-intestinal.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Taking a bit of a break from Rhizaria... haven&amp;#39;t done Excavates in a while.

It&amp;#39;s a thing with several extremely long episymbiotic bacteria riding along it, kinda like torpedoes, so the &amp;#39;eukaryote with bacterial symbionts&amp;#39; was right!I won&amp;#39;t go into detail about oxymonads, since Opisthokont knows a few orders of magnitude more about them than I can pretend to. Perhaps he&amp;#39;d like to contribute some. [/hint] Essentially they are an anaerobic, amitochondriate lineage of mostly termite/cockroach gut endosymbionts. For some reason, most of those gut endosymbiont protists tend to gather entire bacterial worlds around (and inside!) them. Perhaps due to the closed, small nature of the ecosystem, where there is time for various prokaryotes to coevolve with the protists and become closely associated without too much outside disturbance. These protists have been living with termites and cockroaches at least since the early Cretaceous (Poinar 2009 Parasit Vectors), so there&amp;#39;s been plenty of time for entire phyla to be borne of this relationship.Oh, apparently there&amp;#39;s such thing as hunting around for termite endosymbionts in amber!

And this is from someone who&amp;#39;s not much of a paleontology nut. Anyway, back to Streblomastix.An interesting question is, what are those bacteria doing? The cell structure seems adapted for episymbiosis, complete with specialised attachment sites. Sure enough, killing off the bacteria with antibiotics results in the eukaryote&amp;#39;s imminent death (Leander &amp;amp; Keeling 2004 JEM). The specifics of the relationship still remain poorly understood, it seems. There&amp;#39;s also even more elusive intracellular bacteria. Basically if you look at an animal or plant carefully enough, you&amp;#39;ll find entire ecosystems of protists and prokaryotes. If you look at a protist carefully enough, chances are there&amp;#39;ll be an entire bacterial ecosystem in its own right...but I digress.Leander &amp;amp; Keeling 2004 J Euk Microbiol; m1-3 - three distinct morphotypes of bacteria, scalebar=0.5um; 16 - TEM cross section of a &amp;#39;vane&amp;#39; tip with arrows showing the glycocalyx-like connections between bacteria and the host.  17 - posterior tip of Streblomastix showing the &amp;#39;cupping&amp;#39; of the final bacterium.Actually, a winged termite (Zootermopsis!) had the great misfortune of appearing before my face yesterday.

The Trichonymphas turned out better, but barely... Sigh, I really need Trager medium... and access to a camera that is not too slow even for plants. I guess that means no colour CCD, since those tend to need a lot of light, and therefore a much longer exposure. Although there must be fast colour cameras too...(still must redeem self:Trichonympha. Happy? More termite gut imagery to follow later...)Ok, it&amp;#39;s getting late, I think I&amp;#39;m getting a cold of sorts (I wish it&amp;#39;d make up its mind already, whether it feels like showing up or not. And please, let it be finished before I visit the parents. Mothers + cold = overreaction x 1000!!!) and I&amp;#39;m just gonna have to leave this post in a half-sucky state. Did any of it make sense?As for the next major topic, it&amp;#39;ll be the origins of Eukarya and the Neomuran Hypothesis, with plenty of famously clear and comprehensible diagrams by the God of Protistology. Also, there&amp;#39;s a recent Science article by Carl Zimmer that awaits a bit of gentle shredding. Actually, I&amp;#39;ll wait until Rosie&amp;#39;s reply to his sex article is published next week =D  But prior to Neomura, there is a massive rant in store.

The exhaustiveness assumption where the direct measure D is a strictly monotonic function of conscious information c and a weakly monotonic function of unconscious information u and the indirect measure I is a weakly monotonic function of both c and u. Under these conditions, D(c,u)=0 necessitates c=0 and I(c,u)&amp;gt;0 implies I(0,u)&amp;gt;0 which in turn implies u&amp;gt;0. In such a case, I is a perfect measure of unconscious processing. The second assumption was the exclusiveness assumption, where I  is an exclusive weakly monotonic function of u alone, and is unaffected by c. And so, the exclusiveness assumption abolishes the need for a direct measure altogether An interesting way to circumvent these  assumptions is to let awareness vary over experimental conditions. It may then be possible to establish a double dissociation, which consists of finding an experimental manipulation that changes D and I in opposite directions (see. Fig 2a). In particular, any pair of experimental conditions that leads  to opposite ordering of data points in direct and indirect measures  gives evidence for double dissociation. One example could be a priming experiment with two (or more) masking conditions where the priming effect (indirect measure) increases while prime identification (direct measure) performance decreases over experimental conditions. It is obvious that two measures of information going in opposite directions cannot be monotonically driven by a single information source (see Schmidt and Vorberg (2006) for a formal proof). Double dissociations have surprising features. Firstly, they require D to be non-constant. In order to obtain a double dissociation, variations in awareness over experimental conditions must occur so that there is a non-zero awareness of the prime under atleast some conditions. Also, the assumptions are less stringent. The only assumption we make here is that both D and I are weakly monotonic in c (see Fig 2b). One can even drop the weak monotonicity assumption on u, allowing for c and u to produce arbitrary interactive effects on D and I for instance, c and u could be mutually inhibitory).An example of Simple Dissociation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Their correct functioning depends on the integrity of 20,000 or so genes (in the case of humans), and at least 5 times as many proteins whose form is specified by the genes. Damage to even one of a few thousand important genes can put a cell on the road to becoming cancerous. So the first fact about cancer isn&amp;#39;t really all that hard to understand: cancer (in all of its many forms) is a disease that begins with damage to the DNA of one or more genes.This damage, which is necessary but not sufficient, can occur in many ways. Sometimes it happens because of the action of external agents, like carcinogenic chemicals or high-energy radiation (including ultraviolet light). Other times it happens simply because of occasional errors made in copying DNA during the process of cell division. These are just a few of many ways in which DNA can suffer damage. It&amp;#39;s estimated that from 10,000 to a million DNA mutations can occur in a single human cell per day.Fortunately, only a few percent of the 3 billion fundamental units (base pairs) of DNA actually occur within genes – everything else is &amp;quot;noncoding DNA&amp;quot;. Although much of this noncoding DNA serves some useful purpose, we have little idea at present what that might be. However, it&amp;#39;s certainly less critical to cell function than the DNA of actual genes. Even so, 10,000 or so genes in every cell could suffer mutations every day.Of course, complex multicellular life couldn&amp;#39;t exist unless nature had evolved some means for coping with all this random genetic damage. And so, there are a large number of ways that cells have of detecting and repairing the damage that does occur. Then in the relatively small number of cases where damage cannot be repaired, cells have additional fail-safe mechanisms to avoid malfunctions which lead to unlimited proliferation – i. e. cancer. One such mechanism is for a cell to enter a state of &amp;quot;senescence&amp;quot;, where it ceases to be able to divide at all. A more drastic, but common, mechanism is for the cell to undergo &amp;quot;apoptosis&amp;quot; – orderly cell death.A necessary condition, therefore, for a cell to become cancerous, even after DNA damage remains unrepaired (perhaps because of damage to part of the repair mechanism), is that the damage occurs in a gene that codes for proteins needed for one of the various fail-safe mechanisms. Consequently, in almost every case of cancer where a tumor has begun to form, one finds problems in some part of the cell&amp;#39;s anti-proliferation machinery.We&amp;#39;ll look at a recent piece of research that identifies one particular way this can happen, and it&amp;#39;s interesting for the variety of different cell processes that become involved.Many of the known &amp;quot;causes&amp;quot; of cancer are fairly easy to understand. Certainly, the cancer risk from DNA-damaging carcinogenic chemicals is obvious enough. And once one understands how important a key protein known as p53 is in crucial cellular processes such as detection of unrepaired DNA damage and invocation of apoptosis if necessary, it&amp;#39;s not hard to understand why more than 50% of human tumors have mutated genes for p53.But there are other factors which have been found, in epidemiological studies, to be statistically associated with cancer development. One of these is inflammation, which is a very normal part of the body&amp;#39;s immunological defenses against infection. Inflammation itself is a highly complex process – too complex to outline here. Chronic infections by various agents can cause a state of persistent inflammation. An example is the result of H. pylori bacterial infections. In addition to being responsible for stomach ulcers, such infections are also found in cases of stomach cancer. Obesity is also known as an epidemiological factor in various cancers, and the reason is now thought to be the state of chronic inflammation that obesity often causes.What is not clear is exactly what mechanism connects inflammation with cancer. There&amp;#39;s undoubtedly a variety of mechanisms, given how complicated cellular processes turn out to be when you get down to the finer details. The recent research mentioned above illustrated one such mechanism, in one single type of cancer.Anti-inflammatory drugs may defeat a treatment-resistant type of cancer (6/24/09)The research focused on a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In some patients with the disease, chemotherapy works well. In a recent study of 40 patients more than 75 percent of patients with one form of this type of lymphoma survived five years or longer.But that study also identified a group of patients whose cancer proved difficult to treat. Their tumors failed to respond to chemotherapy, and only 16 percent of patients with this form of lymphoma survived more than five years after they were diagnosed.Several molecular flags mark this treatment-resistant lymphoma, but the links between them were unknown until now. The new paper reports that tumor cells isolated from these patients have depressed levels of a protein called SHIP1, which was known to suppress tumors. In fact, patients with the lowest levels of SHIP1 are the least likely to survive. SHIP1 is a phosphatase enzyme. That means it removes phosphate groups from proteins. So a phosphatase has the opposite effect of enzymes known as kinases, which attach phosphate groups to proteins. Having a phosphate group attached at the right place on a protein is what enables the protein to take part in a signaling pathway, which is the basic communication mechanism in a cell responsible for making things happen. Therefore, phosphatases disrupt pathways, and stop things from happening. This can be beneficial, for example, if what&amp;#39;s happening is the excessive cell division that occurs in cancer. Accordingly, SHIP1 has been found to be a tumor suppressing protein.In the case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), it is found that SHIP1 levels are abnormally low. It&amp;#39;s not that the SHIP1 is defective; there&amp;#39;s just not enough of it. So the question is why. Is there some other defective gene that&amp;#39;s responsible?Apparently, there is not. Instead, it&amp;#39;s the presence of inflammation that&amp;#39;s responsible, and in an interesting way. Inflammation is a perfectly normal product of the body&amp;#39;s immune system, and it exists to counteract harmful agents such as bacteria. The immune system initiates and regulates the process of inflammation by means of signaling molecules called cytokines. One of the more common and important of these cytokines is TNFα.Now, TNFα normally goes about its business without causing cancer or other lasting ill effects. In fact, under the right conditions it can induce apoptosis or inhibit tumor formation in other ways. But for some reason, in DLBCL, TNFα suppresses SHIP1, and thus promotes cancer. The research in question also discovered the mechanism of SHIP1 suppression. It turns out that the real culprit here is a small piece of microRNA called miR-155. This little bugger was already known to be involved with leukemia in mice, and with other cancers. (See references in here.)The resistant type of lymphoma cells also have elevated levels of miR-155, a specific example of a type of genetic material called microRNA, the team found. They demonstrated that miR-155 suppresses SHIP1 by sticking to the template for the protein, preventing its manufacture. ...The final clue came from earlier reports that an inflammatory molecule called TNFα could boost levels of miR-155. Additional laboratory work confirmed the observation for this type of lymphoma cell. Some anti-inflammatory drugs, used for diseases such as arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, where inflammation gets out of hand, work by suppressing TNFα. So it was hypothesized that such a drug might be beneficial in treating DLBCL. And voilà:The anti-inflammatory drugs etanercept and infliximab, which are currently used to treat arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, work by suppressing TNFα, suggesting a new way to curb the malignancy of this type of lymphoma.The team tested the idea in mice that had been injected with aggressive lymphoma cells and found that nascent tumors shrank in six days. However, mice are not humans, so the drugs need to be tested in human DLBCL patients. Patients are already being recruited for clinical studies.Now, there...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

 科学网以“《自然》社论：中国科学亟需新型学术社团”为题报道了2009年2月19日出版的《自然》杂志刊登社论——《集体责任》（Collective responsibilities），批评了中国专业学术团体的现状。该社论认为，中国科学家必须有效地组织起来，中国科学才能健康发展。我认为，这篇社论的分析非常深刻，我们的确需要真正有效的科学家组织、学术共同体，不能总是让科学家在很多科学问题和科学界的是非问题中“失语”。

   该社论说，近来在中国吵得沸沸扬扬的干细胞疗法已经引起卫生部门的担忧。至今并无明确证据表明这些疗法管用，但也没有证据说明它们对人体有害。目前仍有成千上万的人准备花费数以千计甚至万计的金钱来尝试这种疗法。问题是，医生们是否利用了病人们想要得到治疗的急切心态？人们又该如何认清这一切？

 社论说，显而易见的是，人们应该到国家干细胞学会去寻求指导。但可惜的是，中国并没有这样的学会。中国的一群科学家，包括很多具有国际声誉的著名研究人员正在设法创建这样一个学会。不过因为种种原因，中国只成立了附属性质的相关“二级”机构。这些二级学会协会没有经济自主权，决策也必须通过其母机构。

社论说，种种事例表明，让科学家团结起来对中国有利而无害。这不仅会帮助促进科学的发展，同时也有助于中国从容面对种种挑战。

社论表示，中国科学家需要新型的社会团体。中国南方的科学家经常不了解北方科学界的状况，反之亦然，而当前的大部分学术团体运行得并不是很好。年会经常成为了炫耀的机会，精英科学家昂首阔步，夸夸其谈，他们根据血统而不是科学观点形成派系。大家都不重视向学界引见研究生。建设性批评意见更易被当作是翻脸的手段，而不是真知灼见。结果，许多科学家根本懒得参加这类会议。有时候一些大工程确实将研究人员聚集在了一起，但是工程的策划会更像是在瓜分“战利品”，而不是构建最富建设性的研究计划。

社论称，这些缺点导致中国科学失去竞争力。更强大的学术团体将为更好的交流和更高产的合作铺平道路，也将为科学批评反馈提供平台。而这反过来又将鼓励大批诚实的批评家的出现，然后资助机构才可以咨询他们。现在经常出现的情况是，资助机构并没有听取多种声音来获得来自学界的代表性观点，而只是听从了某几个人脉广泛的科学家。强大的国内科学团体另外一个好处是，它可作为与其它地方科学家和团体进行建设性接触的参考点。而且，它们也可成为政府的咨询部门。

社论最后说，中国只拥有小型研究团体的日子已经过去了，科学现在对于中国的声誉和利益已经变得非常重要。中国如果要更充分地从其中受益，研究人员的“网络化”也应该允许繁荣发展。（科学网 梅进/编译 何姣校）

环状聚合物本身熔体只有粘度上的collasp，但是一量加入线形同类的时候，就来事了。“由于好多条线穿到环里，导致环要扩张，引起了环-环相互作用，形成了渝渗临界点。”这么短短的一句话里，就包含了一大串很hot的概念。不过，线穿到了环里这一说法是实验证实了的。把线交联掉，能困住穿进的环，如果有的话。这就又导致一个问题，就是想研究纯环状聚合物的性质很困难，因为稍微有一点线形同类杂质都会大大影响其实验结果，而线形同类杂质是很难去掉的。

不过，对于PEO来说，可能用α-环糊精去掉。我是很难想象我硕士做的那点儿东西，原来可以在环状聚合物的纯化上起到大作用。如果硕士答辩的时候老师问我：“你把高分子穿到环糊精里有什么用？”我回答说：“用来倒掉！剩下的就是环状高分子了！”那个老师会怎么想？

所以永远不要限定自己论文的读者。

原本按照我的理解程度，大家关心“大幅”的振荡剪切，实际上是在关心非线性粘弹性。因为许多粘弹性试样都是在大幅度应变下表现出明显的非线性行为的。照我理解所有粘弹性样品都是非线性粘弹性的。在学界认识了非线性粘弹性之后，线性粘弹性的那一套定律只能说是在小幅形变下的简化近似，就好像牛顿力学定律是相对论在低速条件下的简化近似一样。至底什么时候算“大幅”，什么时候不能忽略非线性粘弹性的问题，也就跟到底什么时候是高速，什么时候要考虑相对论的问题一个性质。大幅和小幅之间没有明确的界限。

这种理解可能要变一下了。2005年Nature上的一篇文章（Nature 2005, 438, 997-1100）考察了悬浮液在振荡剪切下悬浮粒子的行踪问题。发现如果振荡剪切的幅度足够小，悬浮粒子基本上原地不动；当幅度大于一定程度，粒子就混起来了，具有扩散的性质。该小组进一步（Nat. Phys. 2008, 4, 420-424）通过建模在二维空间重现了这一现象，表明这是一种相变，有渝渗阈值。这几天又看到Menon对这一现象进行后续研究（Phys. Rev. E 2009, 79, 061108），貌似想讨论universality的问题，但具体我还没看懂。

这一系列研究已经是在讨论振荡剪切的幅度问题了，只是没有跟非线性粘弹性联系起来。作者是具体到悬浮液这一体系，从creep flow的方程出发考虑问题，相变原因解释为粒子之间的相互作用导致的非平衡态。而在流变学中，大幅形变下试样出现非线性粘弹性的解释也是某种平衡的破坏。我猜测这两者是同一件事，出现混沌的那个相变阈振幅就对应着非线性粘弹性不可忽略的那个振幅。Nat. Phys.那篇文章还说相变之后有自组织行为，而许多试样在大幅剪切下也的确出现诸如shear banding、shear-induced ordering的现象，我猜测二者也是对应的。不过，其他试样悬浮体系，如果要证明这些都是同一类相变的universality，似乎要在creep flow方程的基础上进一步抽象的理论才行。我是做实验的不是做理论的，我琢磨着这一相变在流变学函数中能不能体现出来，能不能把它从实验上做出来。

In fact, I didn’t go there just for undergraduate studies or medical school, but rather for both, graduating with a B.S. in Chemistry with Honors in 1984 and from medical school in 1988. In my eight years in Ann Arbor, I came to love the place, and I still have an affinity for it, even though it’s been over 20 years since I last walked about the campus as a student, although I have been back from time to time for various functions, most recently to see Brian Deer speak last winter. True, I’m not fanatical about it, as some of my contemporaries and friends who attened U. of M. with me back in the 1980s (and, sadly, the string of losses to Ohio State and the definitively mediocre last season Michigan had last year make it very hard to be a Michigan football fan these days). However, I do have considerable affection for the place. It molded me, trained me in science, taught me medicine, and provided me the basis for everything I do professionally today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention all of this because I’ve become very disappointed with the &lt;a href="http://www.med.umich.edu"&gt;University of Michigan Medical School&lt;/a&gt; of late. The reason is that it’s “distinguished itself” as a leading institution teaching and promoting the mish-mash of sometimes mutually contradictory modalities, the vast majority of which are either based on mysticism or pseudoscience, known commonly as either “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) or “integrative medicine” (IM). The &lt;a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/umim"&gt;University of Michigan Integrative Medicine Program&lt;/a&gt; (UMIM) describes itself thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Michigan Integrative Medicine, an interdisciplinary program, is committed to the thoughtful and compassionate integration of complementary therapies and conventional medicine through the activities of research, education, clinical services and community partnerships. As a healing-oriented approach to medical care, integrative medicine takes into account the whole person (body, mind, spirit and emotion), including all aspects of lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision, mission and values of the University of Michigan Integrative Medicine (UMIM) program reflect our belief that patients and our community are best served when all available therapies are considered in concert with an approach that recognizes the intrinsic wholeness of each individual. It also reflects our belief that the best medicine is practiced in collaboration with a wide variety of healthcare professionals and with our patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, my alma mater could well be featured in Kim’s old feature, the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=The+Weekly+Waluation+of+the+Weasel+Words+of+Woo"&gt;Weekly Waluation of the Weasel Words of Woo&lt;/a&gt; (W&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;). Indeed, look at the &lt;a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/education/curriculum.htm"&gt;medical student curriculum supported by this program&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by a five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), University of Michigan Integrative Medicine (UMIM) piloted its first Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) courses for medical students during the Fall Term of 2000. A unique aspect of the CAM course sequence is that it is longitudinal, extending across the entire four-year U-M Medical School curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, implementation of the curriculum has involved the participation of approximately 600 undergraduate medical students and 200 physicians/practitioners. Instruction has touched upon the following five CAM domains as identified by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternative medical systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind-body interventions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biologically based therapies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulative and body-based methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy therapies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy therapies? As you can see my alma mater, my beloved U. of M., appears to have wholeheartedly embraced what Dr. Robert Donnell has referred to as “&lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;.” Indeed, it now has a fellowship in IM that is &lt;a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/education/overview.htm"&gt;described thusly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellows design elective experiences in integrative medicine using resources found within the university health care system. Topics may include (but are not limited to): Aromatherapy, Health System Management, Herbal Therapies, Holistic Nutrition, Integrative Pharmacy, Manipulative Therapies, Mind-Body Medicine, and Naturopathic Medicine. Fellows also participate in weekly formal learning activities through U-M Integrative Medicine and the Department of Family Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial support is provided to achieve competency in one defined core curricular area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduates of this program will model best practices in integrative health care by embracing healing-oriented medicine that takes into account the whole person (body, mind and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. This philosophy emphasizes therapeutic relationships and recognizes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; indeed. Notice how no mention is made of science or the scientific basis of any of these therapies. To read the &lt;a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/umim/education/WEB-Objectives.pdf"&gt;educational objectives&lt;/a&gt; is to see just how little science matters in IM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is yet another in the series of my characteristically self-indulgently logorrheic introductions to an analysis of a study. It turns out that U. of M. is trying to do something resembling science about CAM. The problem is that, like many investigators and universities do, it’s falling for the same problems and fallacies when true believers try to do what Harriet Hall has so delightfully termed “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=44"&gt;Tooth Fairy science&lt;/a&gt;.” I never thought I’d be saying it, but it looks as though my alma mater is doing a bit of the ol’ Tooth Fairy science. Several readers sent me this study, and, since it came from U. of M., I figured it falls upon me, among the SBM bloggers, to take it on. Let us start with how I found out about this study, a credulous article published last week and entitled &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2009/08/acupuncture-boosts-effects-of-painkillers-whether-natural-or-prescription.html"&gt;Acupuncture boosts effects of painkillers, natural or prescription&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-tech images of the brains of chronic pain sufferers have found that the ancient practice of acupuncture fights pain by making key brain cells more sensitive to the pain-dampening effects of opioid chemicals. The study, published online in the August issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, comes less than a year after the publication of a controversial study that concluded acupuncture was no more effective than sham treatment at reducing pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan’s Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center used a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner to view the brains of 20 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia who reported suffering nerve and muscle pain at least 50% of the time. The PET scans were conducted during each woman’s first acupuncture session and, a month later, her eighth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the regions of the brain that process and dampen pain signals — the amygdala, caudate, cingula, thalamus and insula — the PET scans showed an increase in the receptivity — and possibly the number — of brain cells to which opioid substances bind. Study author Richard E. Harris said that suggests that acupuncture appears to make the body more responsive to opioid painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Dr. Harris is not only a molecular biologist but a licensed acupuncturist, which goes to show just how much people can compartmentalize science and belief, walling them off from each other. There are, not unexpectedly, methodological problems with this article that render its conclusions questionable, but in reality it’s more a problem of interpretation. There’s a famous line from &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt;, where the character Inigo Montoya says of a word, “I do not think it means what you think it means.” In the case of this study, I would paraphrase that famous line to say, “I do not think your results mean what you think they mean.” Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris acknowledges up front that several studies have now shown acupuncture to be no more efficacious than sham acupuncture. Indeed, we have written about such studies right here on SBM that show that acupuncture is no more effective than sham acupuncture. It doesn’t matter if the sham acupuncture is needles inserted in the “wrong” acupuncture points or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=162"&gt;fake needles&lt;/a&gt; that do not penetrate the skin or even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=492"&gt;toothpicks&lt;/a&gt;. The most reasonable scientific conclusion from all of these studies is that acupuncture, as practiced by adherents of traditional Chinese medicine, does not work. At the very best, it’s a nonspecific effect that doesn’t rely on anything resembling a system. More likely, acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo. None of this, however, stops Harris’ group from trying to show that there is a different between sham acupuncture and real acupuncture at some sort of level, and this study is their attempt to do just that. Here is the background as Harris states it in the introduction to his study, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19501658?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Traditional Chinese acupuncture and placebo (sham) acupuncture are differentiated by their effects on μ-opioid receptors (MORs)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent controversy in the field of acupuncture research was generated when several large scale randomized controlled trials in chronic pain patients failed to show superiority of acupuncture over sham acupuncture methods (Brinkhaus et al., 2006; Linde et al., 2005; Melchart et al., 2005; Harris et al., 2005). This has lead opponents of acupuncture therapy to suggest that it is no more effective than a placebo intervention. Since placebo administration also induces activation of opioid receptors, specifically the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) class (Benedetti and Amanzio, 1997; Zubieta et al., 2005; Amanzio and Benedetti, 1999; Levine et al., 1978; Pomeranz and Chiu, 1976), acupuncture may indeed operate in part via placebo mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s almost certainly no “may” about it, and you can also almost certainly safely scratch “in part,” but that’s just me being a nasty skeptic or, as I like to think, a good scientist. I also find it curious why Harris would refer to investigators who are telling it like it is, so to speak, and pointing out accurately what these studies show “opponents” of acupuncture. It suggests a bit of an adversarial, defensive, “I’ll show you” mindset right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, the hypothesis to be studied is that long term acupuncture therapy somehow results in increased μ-opioid receptor availability and that this effect would not be seen in a sham acupuncture group. Harris chose fibromyalgia (FM) patients for his study because previous work of his had shown that FM patients have reduced central μ-opioid receptor (MOR) binding potential. In that study patients with greater clinical pain were found to have reduced MOR binding potential, and Dr. Harris wondered if acupuncture could somehow increase that binding potential and thus relieve pain. Thus, this study is the classic example of a researcher taking a technique developed for the study of one question and applying it to another question, and what Harris asks is whether acupuncture and sham acupuncture have different (or any) effects on these receptors. Specifically, the technique used is positron emission tomography (PET) designed to look at the binding of opioids to these receptors using &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-carfentanil (CFN) positron emission tomography (PET) with the μ-opioid selective radiotracer [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved randomizing 20 women with FM into one of two groups, either sham acupuncture or “real” acupuncture. Subjects were blinded to which group they were in, but investigators were not, and a questionnaire was given to see if patients could guess what group they were in. The results in each group were no more accurate than random chance, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;patient&lt;/em&gt; blinding, at least, was good. It was not clear to me, however, from the text whether those who were evaluating the PET scans were also blinded to which experimental group each patient was in. That is such a mind-numbingly obviously necessary part of designing any imaging experiment such as this that I will assume that the physicians reading the scans were in fact blinded to what experimental group each scan came from, but it’s disturbing that this very basic experimental design point wasn’t explicitly stated anywhere. Also, it’s clear that the investigators doing the acupuncture or sham acupuncture were not blinded. There are now retractable sham needles available that do a pretty good job of hiding from even acupuncturists whether a real needle went in or not; I wonder why those weren’t used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to demographics or initial pain scores, and patients were excluded who: had previous experience with acupuncture; had current use or a history of use of opioid or narcotic analgesics; had a history of substance abuse; had the presence of a known coagulation abnormality, thrombocytopenia, or bleeding diathesis that may preclude the safe use of acupuncture; had the presence of concurrent autoimmune or inflammatory disease; had concurrent participation in other therapeutic trials; were pregnant and nursing mothers; had severe psychiatric illnesses; or had contraindications to PET. Outcome measures included clinical pain scores using the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire and measures of μ-opioid binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in many other studies of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture, non-insertional sham needles were used for the sham acupuncture procedure. Patients underwent a total of nine acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatments over the course of a month, undergoing PET scans at treatment #1 and tretament #9. At each of the two PET sessions, study participants first underwent a baseline scan for minutes 10-40 after infusion of the radiotracer, then the acupuncture or sham procedure, then another scan at 45-90 minutes. The researchers reported both short term increases in μ-opioid binding in various parts of the brain involved in sensory processing, including the cingulate, amygdala, insula, thalamus, and caudate. Longer term increases in MOR binding were also observed in a subset of the same structures, including the cingulate, caudate, and amygdala. There were no such increases in the sham acupuncture group, and in some regions small reductions of MOR binding were observed. Consistent with the other acupuncture studies that Harris mentioned, there was no difference in pain scores between the sham and “true” acupuncture groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least that much is consistent with previous results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one big problem with this study. Needles were retained for the acupuncture group, but there were no needles in the sham acupuncture group because no needles had been inserted. It’s not clear to me from the methods whether the sham needles were left attached to the skin or not. Even if the subject were blindfolded, as these subjects were, I would think that would be very important in order to make the groups as much “alike” as possible. Whatever the true case was, the fact remains that, during the second PET scan period there was a definite difference between the two groups. The “true acupuncture” group had needles sticking into their skin at acupuncture points. The sham acupuncture group did not. Couldn’t that more or less completely explain the short term results? In essence, what Harris studied was differences in neurobiology between subjects who had needles sticking out of their skin and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the second big problem. Take a look at this figure, which is Figure 1B from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1B" title="Figure 1B" width="500" height="242"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice something? The “true acupuncture” (left side, in red) procedure is not only different from the sham in that the sham doesn’t actually insert any needles. It uses different locations! The text calls them “similar” because they are in the same body part. Not how, for example, sham point #1 is on the head, but not in the same location as Du 20); sham point #2 is on the ear but on the earlobe instead of the pinna; sham point #3 is on the anterior surface of the right arm instead of the posterior surface of the left arm; most of the sham points in the leg are on the thigh, rather than the lower leg, where the “true” acupuncture points are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone see a problem with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do. In designing a good placebo control for an acupuncture study (or any other randomized clinical study), you shouldn’t, if you can possibly help it, mix and match changes in the procedure to produce your sham procedure. When you choose a sham acupuncture procedure, either insert the needles as usual in the “wrong” places or use the sham needles that don’t pierce the skin in the “right” places. Or have two groups and compare both. Don’t place sham needles that don’t pierce the skin in the “wrong” places. That’s two differences between the sham procedure and acupuncture and opens the door to a lot of confounders. Again, couldn’t this using a sham procedure that uses the “wrong” points and needles that don’t pierce the skin also partially explain the results of this study? Couldn’t the combination of using different locations and no insertion for the sham confound the results sufficiently as to render the results of this study virtually meaningless. I argue that they potentially can. I can’t prove it, but certainly the methodological shortcomings of this trial make it hard to take as any definitive evidence that there is different neurobiology going on between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture. All it does is to show that maybe there is a neurobiological difference between having needles sticking out of the skin and not having needles sticking out of the skin, which would be of little surprise, although the exact difference could be of interest. What this study does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; show is that acupuncture “works.” I suppose it’s possible that sticking needles in the skin may have nonspecific effects that might alleviate pain, but this very study shows that they are no different than placebo. After all, there was no difference in pain relief between subjects receiving sham acupuncture and real acupuncture. Both experienced the same amount of subjective pain relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that that stops Harris from trying to imply that sham and true acupuncture “work” through different mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another intriguing result from the present study is that although MOR BP values were differentially altered by TA and SA, reduction in clinical pain was similar between groups. In a clinical trial, when an active treatment does not exhibit superior efficacy to a sham or placebo, the active treatment is assumed to be ineffective and only operating via a placebo effect. However this study suggests that this may be an erroneous conclusion. In this instance, our non-insertion sham procedure evoked a similar reduction in pain as our true acupuncture and we speculate that this occurred via a different mechanism. The analgesic effects of SA could have been due to regional reductions in MOR BP, consistent with activation of this class of receptors during placebo effects (Zubieta et al., 2005), whereas TA evoked an increase in receptor binding availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the perceived pain relief accorded by sham acupuncture and true acupuncture could be occurring by placebo mechanisms entirely unrelated to the observation of this study, which may have had nothing to do with the clinical placebo effects seen. That’s a rather more simple explanation for these results than all that handwaving (and, yes, it is mostly handwaving) in the paragraph above. I’m rather surprised the reviewers didn’t make Harris revise his manuscript to consider this possibility and discuss it. Harris could be correct. I doubt that he is, but he could be. However, my alternate explanation could also be correct. Moreover, even if he is correct, so what? It might be intellectually interesting and useful for understanding the placebo effect to determine the differences in neurobiology underlying two different placebo treatments, but none of this validates acupuncture as anything more than an elaborate placebo. It’s also a long run for a short slide, so to speak, in that nine sessions in a month of sticking needles into the body seems a lot to undergo for such minimal results based on such tenuous mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also depressing to see how the press has spun this study. Reports on the study are more or less reporting it exactly as Harris represented his results in the Discussion section of his paper. I have yet to see a news story with anything more than a very token skeptical view. Instead, they all proclaim this study as evidence that acupuncture can somehow crank up the level of opioid receptors to the point where they make opioid drugs work better. Heck, the article I cited said that this study shows that acupuncture can increase the efficacy of opioid analgesics, either natural or prescription! There’s zero evidence presented in this paper that shows that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper represents to me the latest in a line of rationalizations of acupuncture. Acupuncturists start out saying that “acupuncture works” based on nonblinded studies for which placebo effects are not adequately controlled for. Then, when better studies show that true acupuncture is no better than sham acupuncture (or, amusingly, sometimes that the sham acupuncture “works” better), they rationalize it by saying either that the sham was not a good sham or that these studies don’t say anything because sham acupuncture “works” too. Harris takes a different tack in saying that, yes, there’s no difference in perceived pain due to sham acupuncture or true acupuncture not only because they both work but because they both work by different physiological mechanisms. He might have had a (weak) point were it not for his seemingly willful misinterpretation of his results and his changing too many things at the same time in his sham control group. Instead, all he’s shown is that opioid receptors light up more if there are needles in the skin than they do if there are not–hardly a finding that shows that acupuncture “works” and certainly not any sort of finding to validate the entire system of acupuncture, which relies upon the idea of qi flowing through meridians, flows that can be altered to therapeutic effect by sticking needles into those meridians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;ScienceOnline2010, the fourth annual conference on science and the Web, will be held on January 15-17th, 2010 in the Research Triangle Park area (the exact location to be announced).

&lt;p&gt;Please join us for this three-day event to explore science on the Web. Our goal is to bring together scientists, physicians, patients, educators, students, publishers, editors, bloggers, journalists, writers, web developers, programmers and others to discuss, demonstrate and debate online strategies and tools for doing science, publishing science, teaching science, and promoting the public understanding of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The '09 shindig was a fun experience, and I'd like to arrange my affairs so that I could return for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/"&gt;the sequel&lt;/a&gt;.  Last year, during the back-channel planning before the event, I floated the idea of a session on communicating mathematics over the Web (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2008/10/the_necessity_of_mathematics.php"&gt;a topic&lt;/a&gt; I'm known to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/02/how_we_dont_write_mathematics.php"&gt;be a geek for&lt;/a&gt;).  The idea was proposed too late to become anything last time, but &lt;a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/08/what_do_mathematicians_need_to.html"&gt;the subject is still in style&lt;/a&gt;.

Or will you? The universality of human emotions and their expression in the face has become widely accepted in psychology. At the vanguard of this perspective is pioneering psychologist Paul Ekman, the co-creator of the facial action coding system (FACS) - a way of categorising and interpreting facial expressions according to which muscles are tensed. But a new study casts doubt on the idea that facial expressions are culturally universal, showing instead that people from East Asia have trouble distinguishing fear and disgust from surprise and anger, respectively, as conveyed through faces conforming to the FACS system of expression.Rachael Jack and colleagues asked 13 Western Caucasian participants and 13 East Asian participants to look at photographs of dozens of White and Chinese faces, and to categorise them into the six core emotional expressions of happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger and sadness, as determined by the FACS system.The first key finding was that East Asian participants made significantly more errors when categorising disgust and fear compared with the Western participants. Records of the participants&amp;#39; eye movements also showed differences between the groups. The East Asians tended to focus more exclusively on the eye regions of the faces, whereas the Westerners focused on the nose and mouth region just as much as the eyes. A computer model similarly confused fear and surprise for anger and disgust, respectively, when it was programmed to disproportionately sample from the eye and eye brow region.In other words, in faces categorised according to Ekman&amp;#39;s FACS system, observers need to look at the nose and mouth regions to accurately distinguish between fear, surprise, anger and disgust, but the East Asian participants focused on the eyes, thus leading them to make errors. When in doubt, the East Asian participants tended to bias their answers towards the less threatening emotions such as surprise.The findings suggest that certain emotions are expressed slightly differently in East Asia, such that people from that culture have learned to focus on different facial regions.&amp;quot;From here on, examining how the different facets of cultural ideologies and concepts have diversified these basic skills [of communication by facial expression] will elevate knowledge of human emotion processing from a reductionist to a more authentic representation,&amp;quot; the researchers said. &amp;quot;Otherwise when it comes to communicating emotions across cultures, Easterners and Westerners will continue to find themselves lost in translation.&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re interested in this field, you should check out the new hit US TV series &amp;quot;Lie To Me&amp;quot; (available on iTunes in the UK). The lead character, Cal Lightman, is based on Paul Ekman, and Ekman has acted as a consultant to the series._________________________________Jack, R., Blais, C., Scheepers, C., Schyns, P., &amp;amp; Caldara, R.

who listed it among the numerous “proofs” that god exists, so I thought it was time I deconstructed it.  As you’ll see, it didn’t take long to locate the logical fallacy that’s at its heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ontological argument was originally put forward by Anselm of Canterbury in the 11th century.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has two versions of it, but I’m going to refer to what I think is a better version at &lt;a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/o/ont-arg.htm"&gt;The Internet Dictionary of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;: “The Classic Version of the Ontological Argument” as they call it, which they say can accurately be summarized thus:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) It is a conceptual truth (or, so to speak, true by definition) that God is a being than which none greater can be imagined (i.e., the greatest possible being that can be imagined). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) God exists as an idea in the mind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) A being that exists as an idea in the mind and in reality is, other things being equal, greater than a being that exists only as an idea in the mind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4) Thus, if God exists only as an idea in the mind, then we can imagine something that is greater than God (i.e., a greatest possible being that does exist). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No.  Correction - if God exists only as an idea in the mind, then all this means is that we can imagine something that is greater than &lt;strong&gt;the idea of God in the mind &lt;/strong&gt;– not greater than a God who actually exists.  Anselm’s argument relies entirely on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation"&gt;equivocation&lt;/a&gt; - the misleading use of a term that has more than one meaning, while glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time.  Specifically, Anselm relies on there being two meanings of the word “God,” and he slips between these definitions as it suits him.  What are these two meanings of the word “God”?  They are (1) a god who exists in reality and (2) a god who exists only in the mind.  In point 4 above he uses the “god who exists only in the mind” version, but in point 5 he tries to make you think he was talking about the “god who exists in reality,” because point 5 is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;5) But we cannot imagine something that is greater than God (for it is a contradiction to suppose that we can imagine a being greater than the greatest possible being that can be imagined.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, but “the greatest possible being that can be imagined” is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; God who exists only as an idea in the mind – &lt;em&gt;so there is no contradiction&lt;/em&gt;.  It only seems to be a contradiction because Anselm is equivocating between the different meanings of the word “God” and has glossed over which meaning he is using at different points in his argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;6) Therefore, God exists. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No.  Epic FAIL.  Therefore nothing.  All this shows is that we can imagine something greater than a God &lt;em&gt;who exists only in the mind&lt;/em&gt;. But “God who exists only in the mind” is not “a being than which none greater can be imagined.”  In fact, premise 3 specifically states there&lt;em&gt; can be&lt;/em&gt; something greater than this – a God who exists in reality - and so the argument is contradicted by its own premises.  “God who exists only in the mind” is not God, as defined in premise 1, and so it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to imagine something greater, without violating premise 1. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anselm’s mistake will become clearer if we define his terms in a less ambiguous way.  I will rename Anselm’s different versions of God, as God-1 and God-2:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God-1&lt;/strong&gt; = God who exists in reality (the thing whose existence we are trying to prove).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God-2&lt;/strong&gt; = a God who exists only as an idea in the mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we can rephrase the argument:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Nothing greater than God-1 can be imagined &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;God-2 exists.  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;God-1 is greater than God-2 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If God-1 does not exist then we can imagine something greater than God-2 (i.e., God-1) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;But we cannot imagine something that is greater than God-1 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Therefore God-1 exists &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You can see quite clearly now that the argument is bogus.  Point 4 is where it goes wrong.  It only &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to work because Anselm equivocates about the definitions of God-1 and God-2.  This is what he is doing.  He is trying to make point 4 sound like, “If God-1 does not exist then &lt;em&gt;we can imagine something greater than &lt;strong&gt;God-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” (which &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be a contradiction to point 1).  But point 4 only makes sense as “…we can imagine something greater than &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;God-2&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., God-1),&lt;/em&gt;” as in my version.  (Otherwise he is actually saying “If God-1 does not exist then we can imagine something greater than God-1 (i.e., God-1),” which is gibberish.)  He hopes you won’t notice he changed God-2 to God-1 in point 5, setting up the contradiction to point 1.  But he wasn’t talking about God-1 in point 4, so there is no contradiction.  Consequently, point 6 “Therefore God-1 exists,” just doesn’t follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but now we’ve deconstructed it, we can see it doesn’t even make sense.  Consider this.  Point 5 is just a restatement of point 1.  So if you leave out this repeated point (you don’t need it here since it’s already been stated), the last two points (4 and 6) are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If God-1 does not exist then we can imagine something greater than God-2 (i.e., God-1) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Therefore God-1 exists &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;To simplify even further, we can cut out what this allows us to imagine, which leaves:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If God-1 does not exist then … &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;… God-1 exists &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;To go back to the phrasing of the original argument, he is saying, if God exists &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;as an idea in the mind, then God exists in reality. Or, put it even more simply, if God doesn’t exist then he exists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have read several versions of Anselm’s argument, and they all fall apart for exactly the same reason - the logical fallacy of equivocation.  The only surprising thing about this argument, in my view, is that anyone thinks it should be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250488655618"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91f992fa2beec32f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">The Airport Vortex</title><published>2009-08-17T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/679-the-airport-vortex.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="airportvortex" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/airportvortex.jpg" width="300" height="225"&gt;I was recently in Sedona, Arizona.

Her last post:  "Uh-oh, They're here.."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Elisha Strom, who appears unable to make the $750 bail, was arrested outside Charlottesville on July 16 when police raided her house, confiscating notebooks, computers and camera equipment. Although the Charlottesville police chief, Timothy J. Longo Sr., had previously written to Ms. Strom warning her that her blog posts were interfering with the work of a local drug enforcement task force, she was not charged with obstruction of justice or any similar offense. Rather, she was indicted on a single count of identifying a police officer with intent to harass, a felony under state law.

He is incredibly supportive and encouraged me to apply for a summer undergraduate fellowship with the big society in our discipline - which I received, and will be presenting my research at the conference next summer. While I never had considered working in the particular field we study in the lab, I find that I'm quite fond of it, and I am excited to continue my studies in graduate school.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Graduate school is where I need advice. See, I'm one of those "non-traditional" students. I'm married, have kids, and a mortgage. While I am open to going to a different graduate school, what I'm hoping to avoid is uprooting my family too many times in the upcoming years (for graduate school, postdocs, jobs). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My current mentor has expressed that I would be gladly welcomed as a graduate student in his lab, and as we work really well together, my kids love their school, I love my house and town, and my husband (whose income pays our bills) has a job, I'm very tempted to stay. I'm just worried about becoming academically inbred.

I love practicing it, teaching it, learning it...everything about it.  It's also damned scary sometimes.  Knowledge changes; patients don't walk in with textbook diseases; and you have to be able to doubt yourself without drowning in indecision.  Every time a patient brings me an article or monograph that looks relevant to their care, and it's new to me, I have to go through it and see if there really is something to it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there has been some data recently about &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/360/4/411"&gt;popular medications for acid reflux (called PPIs, including such medications as Prilosec) and possible interactions with a potent anti-platelet agent called clopidogrel (Plavix)&lt;/a&gt;. What does this mean for me and my patients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a trivial conundrum.  Here's a fairly typical scenario:  a patient comes in with a heart attack, and the cardiologist performs an intervention to save her.  Knowing the data, the cardiologist decides to deploy a drug-eluding stent in the patient's blocked artery. Without the procedure, the patient is likely to be disabled or dead.  In order to prevent the stent from re-occluding, leading to another heart attack, she must stay on clopidogrel for a long time (probably a year).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a few months into the treatment, the patient develops rectal bleeding.  Endoscopy reveals a bleeding ulcer, which the doctor cauterizes.  In order to prevent further bleeding, the patient needs to be on  proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole (Prilosec).  We can't just stop the clopidogrel, or the patient may have a heart attack.  We also can't let the patient bleed to death.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/medicine_is_still_hard.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/medicine_is_still_hard.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/RmlsvtE9XIM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250471839844"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BhaScienceGroup/~3/W2mkxPoiLFI/christianity-as-civilizing-force-case.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9462625ff5a1c076</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Christianity as a civilizing force?

Now that&amp;#39;s a big question with a lot of arguments on either side. But here&amp;#39;s a new study that gives an interesting angle.The researchers studied women from the Kassena-Nankana of northern Ghana, going there first in 1995, and then back in 2003. What they found was that many of the people in this remote region are changing religions - they&amp;#39;re abandoning traditional beliefs in favour of Christianity.They also found that women are more likely to change religions than are men - overall, 61% of women changed their religions in that time, mostly switching into Christianity although some also became Muslims. The pattern of switching, however, was complex:Among Christians, 52% did not switch to other religions whereas 38% switched to traditional religion and 9% switched to IslamAmong traditionalists, 34% did not switch, 53% became Christians, and 13% became Muslims.Among the Muslims, 11% did not switch whereas 42% and 48% switched to Christianity and traditional religionsWhat&amp;#39;s interesting was that those women who became Christians or Muslims were more likely to use contraception and they also had smaller families.It seems likely that women are changing out of traditional religions and into the monotheist religions because these religions are associated with higher status for women. The particular brand of Christianity that is increasing in this region is the Pentecostal/Charismatic forms, which allows contraception - as does (broadly speaking) Islam.Now this finding throws up some interesting questions. Is there something intrinsic to these two religions that makes them more socially advanced than older animist religions? That would fit with the hypothesis put forward by Robert Wright in his new book, The Evolution of God. He argues that societies are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly mutually beneficial, and their conception of God has evolved to keep pace with that.However, the researchers also found that educated women and ethnic minorities are more likely to switch. And earlier research (Addai, 1999) has shown that, after controlling for demographic factors, there was no effect of religion on contraceptive use by Ghanaian women.But the picture appears to be more complicated than that. In a paper presented last year at a conference on economic development in Africa, Niels-Hugo Blunch reported that there was a relationship between religion and contraception use, but only among uneducated women. Among educated women the effect disappears.So perhaps it&amp;#39;s not the choice of religion that is the cause of the effect, but rather the halo effect in which foreign religions are linked to modern ideas. If this is the case, then the religions are not the direct cause of the increased use of contraception, but rather they piggy-back onto the adoption of western cultural practices in general.  As Blunch puts it:Traditional/Animist religion promotes relatively greater family sizes, so that any religion in Ghana other than Animist/Traditional religion can be expected to be more open to the use of contraceptives, since they implicitly bring with them “modern” (at least relatively speaking) underpinnings from the outside world.It&amp;#39;s an important distinction. If (as secularists and many religious people believe) limiting population growth is a good thing, then it&amp;#39;s an open question whether to promote literacy or Christianity/Islam.Certainly, my preference would be to concentrate resources on improving education, especial given the many other benefits that brings with it._______________________________________________________________________________________Doctor, H., Phillips, J., &amp;amp; Sakeah, E.

You are dedicating a good chunk of your life to the pursuit of some very abstract knowledge after all, and as a reward, you get faint hopes of landing a low-paying job in your field. A bigger secret: you can even be a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; crazy and still manage to land that degree (you, in the back: stop pointing and snickering at me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it means &lt;i&gt;precisely nothing&lt;/i&gt; when someone brags about finding a Ph.D. willing to espouse utter nonsense. It happens all the time — the degree in itself is not an indicator of credibility. It always amuses me to see the creationists getting so excited at finding someone with a doctorate willing to stand up and disavow everything he supposedly learned so that he can praise Jesus and declare the earth to be only 6,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, right now &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=255"&gt;a creationist with a Harvard science degree is lecturing in Boston&lt;/a&gt;  on &lt;a href="http://www.calvarychapelinthecity.com/index.php?page_id=2/"&gt;Evolution: Bankrupt Science; Creationism: Science You Can Bank On&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, Dr Nathaniel Jeanson is one of the fruit loops who plodded through a graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/"&gt;Boston Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; are on his tail and will be reporting on the event. I'll be looking forward to the dissection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/boston_land_ofcreationists.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/QhWfrW3ETkY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250464522757"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/no_apologies.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f293cfaf663ab115</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">No apologies</title><published>2009-08-16T23:25:23Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T23:25:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/2iQlXm05HMg/no_apologies.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/no_apologies.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some very persnickety people have been demanding that I apologize for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/creepy_ol_ken_ham.php"&gt;riding a fiberglas dinosaur at the Creation "Museum"&lt;/a&gt;, because it had a sign saying it was intended only for those under the age of 12. I've thought about it. There is that sign, after all, and if I'd looked a little more carefully, I might have noticed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, I realized that I still would have clambered aboard. There isn&amp;#39;t the slightest twinge of repentance in my heart. I&amp;#39;ll even encourage everyone else to jump on, if you go there — it&amp;#39;s irresistibly ludicrous, and is a good way to thumb your nose at the goofballs running that show. Of course, now they&amp;#39;re going to have a guard hovering around it all the time, so it may be a little trickier. You may also get tased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely must have an excuse, though, it's easy. Ken Ham claims that the world, which by all objective, scientific measures is 4.5 billion years old, is actually only 6,000 years old. Scaling ages by this metric, that means that greying 52 year old geezers like me are only &lt;i&gt;36 minutes old&lt;/i&gt; — obviously, I was created with the appearance of age. 36 minutes is much, much less than 12 years, so I was clearly within the allowed range.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/number-blindness-more-common-than-dyslexia-842781.html"&gt;
Brian Butterworth, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London,&lt;/a&gt; said the disability had nothing to do with how a child was taught, but was the result of children lacking a proper "sense of numbers", which hinders them in maths lessons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Increasingly, the evidence shows that dyscalculia is just as common as dyslexia and yet it is not recognised nearly as widely by teachers, parents, schools, local authorities or central government," Professor Butterworth said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Individuals may be unaware they have this condition. If they discover that they do, there are no dyscalculia charities to assist them as there are for dyslexia," he told the Cheltenham Science Festival yesterday.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The study was carried out in Cuba by the Cuban Ministries of Health and Education, which commissioned a national survey to assess the extent of the problem using a simple screening test developed by Professor Butterworth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"The Cubans have recognised this as a real and serious problem for a child's future. Low numeracy affects life chances in employment and health," Professor Butterworth said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

In 2002, Professor Butterworth gave a presentation on dyscalculia and the development of his screening tool to a British special education audience.

&lt;p&gt;Q: Do you know of any other programs like it in the country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: There are many great programs that provide transitional services to individuals with autism spectrum disorders and other disabilities. However, very few are college based, i.e., are a part of a college like VIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q:How are these programs run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: Most are based in an apartment complex and affiliated with either a community college or a 4-year college. That means the employees of the program work for a private entity and are not employees of the college. The employees of the affiliated programs won’t have the same ability or power to influence the college on behalf of their disabled students as would an employee of a college. The students in the program also may not have the same rights and access to opportunities as if the program were a part of the college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:699px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/enhance.jpg" alt="Image: NYIT VIP" width="689" height="159"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: NYIT VIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How is your program different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: Since we’re a part of the NYIT, we draw upon the infrastructure of the college and the course offerings. Our students enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as the neurotypical NYIT student population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Do other colleges offer support programs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: Many offer support programs for students with disabilities beyond the typical disabled student services offices. However, most focus upon helping students with neurologically based learning disabilities such as dyslexia and ADD or ADHD. They help the student remediate skills and learn organizational strategies. Unfortunately, they don’t help the students with social skills or independent living skills. For students on the autism spectrum , they need help interpreting the social world and learning independent living skills. Marshall College provides a program for students on the spectrum which uses peer mentors to help ASD students. The University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale also has a program to help students with ASDs (although I believe students in that program need to be residents of Illinois). Chapel Haven West in Arizona is affiliated with the University of Arizona and the SALT Center. These programs work on both the academic needs and the social and executive functioning needs of students on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What makes your program unique?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: Students can learn vocational, independent living and social skills. If they’re otherwise qualified, they can also take credit-bearing courses. Furthermore, our model provides wrap-around services that address the student as a whole person with a variety of learning needs. Each student in our program has an academic counselor, a vocational counselor, a budget and banking advisor, a social counselor, resident advisor support, the support of a licensed nurse practitioner, transportation, and if necessary, an independent living skills counselor, and a job coach.&lt;/p&gt;

I have spent many autumn Saturdays crammed in Jordan-Hare Stadium with 87,000 other people (keep in mind that the entire population of the town is around 40,000), and never ceased to be amazed at such a huge aggregation of humans, all there just to watch a game.  The conservation biologist in me always felt some melancholy in contemplating the numbers, however, because the fans for just one game outnumber the population of some entire species by orders of magnitude.  This is, ironically the case with Auburn’s mascot species, the tiger.  If you took every single wild tiger left on the planet and put them in Jordan-Hare, they would fill little more than a single one of the 45 sections in the bleachers.

The tiger (which includes 6 extant and 2 extinct subspecies) is one of the most enigmatic and majestic species gracing our planet, and they have long been a flagship species for conservation efforts.  A new PLoS Genetics paper by Mondol et al. brings news that may be seen as both ominous and auspicious for tiger conservation efforts.

The bad news: tiger populations have essentially been devastated to the point of near-extinction.  The authors found that current tiger populations amount to only 1.7% of the tigers found historically, and are restricted to an almost insignificant 7% of their original range.

The good news: widespread sampling efforts showed that the Indian tigers retain 76% of the genetic diversity found in tigers worldwide.  This indicates that the tigers’ genes are not disappearing as fast as their population numbers. For programs dedicated to preserving genetic diversity of declining species, this is a cause for celebration and hope.

These insights into the genetic structure of Indian tigers also yield clues to the tiger’s history.  Mondol et al.’s analysis of the diversity patterns indicated that about 200 years ago, tigers in this region underwent a significant population crash, most probably human-induced.

This is indeed fascinating.  I am becoming skeptical and jaded in my old age, however, and I am increasingly concerned that the public will get the impression that we can claim conservation success merely by preserving genetic diversity.  Much has been made of “minimum viable populations,” “maximum sustainable yield,” and the like, with too little regard for the integrity and function of food-webs, and the resulting impacts on not only predators and prey but the ecosystem as a whole.  Humans had been doing their best to eradicate large carnivores long before our historical and scientific records began. We would not know how large Indian tiger populations were several centuries ago if analyses like the ones in the current PLoS paper did not allow us to create estimates from molecular evidence. This makes it extremely hard to set appropriate goals for conservation and management plans.

Large carnivores are often the first species to go extinct or decline under stressful ecological conditions (whether anthropogenic or otherwise), and after they are gone their communities often shift from top-down regulated trophic structure to an alternate stable state with bottom-up regulation (Beisner et al. 2003, Steneck et al. 2002). In a sense, the only “natural” state we have ever observed has been one of depleted predator populations.  Therefore, conservation efforts that seek to restore populations to a “minimum viable” number or to densities that match historical records may still be setting the bar far too low for predators to fill their ecological roles in regulating mesopredators and herbivores, which in turn affects smaller non-prey animals and plants, which affects water and soil nutrient content and the physical structure of the habitat itself.  We might be able to preserve all of the genetic diversity of a species in a lab, and may even re-establish self-sustaining populations in the wild, but that does not mean that we have restored them to the densities and distributions required for them to perform the ecological roles that they played in their communities prior to relatively recent population crashes.  Habitat loss and degradation is one of the most critical factors threatening biodiversity today, and as Mills (2003) points out:

“Biodiversity is a broad concept incorporating compositional, structureal, and functional attributes of ecosystems at four levels of organization—namely, landscapes, communities, species, and genes” . . . “the greater the range of ecosystems that can be conserved to accomodate large carnivores, the greater will be the number of opportunities for these variable interactions to be played out and for adaptations to changing conditions to evolve.”

Even if we had a complete tiger genome on hand, it would not do much good if the animals are relegated to zoo cages or small ecotourism resorts. Even if a token number of animals are allowed to roam in the wild, the species would simply be lingering as a present and yet enfeebled shade of its former self, with its role in community interactions and regulation essentially paralyzed.

Don’t get me wrong, genetic diversity is still an crucial factor, and the results of this paper are both important and fascinating. This information gives us further clues as to the size and distribution of historic tiger populations, which can lead to further analyses of predator-prey relationships and ecosystem interactions. The news about the remaining genetic diversity is encouraging; inbreeding depression can potentially prevent species from ever recovering from extremely low population numbers, even if their habitat is restored.

I suppose I just worry that we will lose sight of the forest for the trees, (or maybe lose sight of the tigers for the stripes, if I may put a spin on the metaphor?), and run the risk of congratulating ourselves for meeting artificially low bars due to shifting baselines of predator densities. The important thing is to keep in mind that conservation efforts cannot be broken down into parts; species they must be treated as integrated wholes, “package deals” including genes, physiology, behavior, and role in community interactions.

&lt;p&gt;Baigent is about to release his new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061363189?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061363189"&gt;Racing Toward Armageddon: The Three Great Religions and the Plot to End the World&lt;/a&gt;, which is about… well… you can figure that out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher has granted me an email interview with the author, so if you have any questions for Baigent, please leave them in the comments by Monday night!&lt;br&gt;

For readers new to the issue, the British Chiropractic Association, using the UK&amp;#39;s horrendous libel laws, &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/340"&gt;tried to silence Simon Singh&amp;#39;s critique of chiropractic.  &lt;/a&gt;Skeptics and scientists pushed back by posting the article, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380"&gt;Beware the Spinal Trap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;  as widely as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Meadon, who writes &lt;a href="http://ionian-enchantment.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ionian Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, had the following suggestion: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I also want to use the hosting soapbox to flog an idea: the single best way to push back against such scandalously censorious behavior is to harness the power of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt; and make sure Simon&amp;#39;s article is as widely disseminated as possible. The mass reposting was certainly a good first step, but ensuring skeptical and scientific information appears high in search rankings for &amp;quot;chiropractic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;chiropractor&amp;quot; would have an even greater, and lasting, impact. So I propose we &lt;a href="http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2008/11/01/skeptics-load-your-google-bombs/"&gt;Google Bomb&lt;/a&gt; those BCA bastards. Here&amp;#39;s what to do: take the words &amp;quot;chiropractor&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;chiropractic&amp;quot; and link them to: &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380"&gt;http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380&lt;/a&gt; (which should look like: &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380"&gt;chiropractor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/380"&gt;chiropractic&lt;/a&gt;). For extra credit you can also link those words to &lt;a href="http://www.chirobase.org/"&gt;Chirobase&lt;/a&gt; and the relevant &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/chiro.html"&gt;Skepdic entry&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;quot;British Chiropractic Association&amp;quot; to a critical &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=555"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/span&gt; entry&lt;/a&gt;. If you really want to go the extra mile, link &amp;quot;English libel law&amp;quot; to: http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333, so &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333"&gt;English libel law&lt;/a&gt;... .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The next edition of the Circle arrives on August 27th at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://evolvingmind.info/blog/"&gt;The Evolving Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;...

I hate when &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/how_to_argue.php#comment-1847885"&gt;that happens&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I totally get it.  There is absolutely no place for name calling, contradiction, or the ad hominem attack.  It is not an effective tactic.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/08/dumbass_quote_of_the_day_47.php"&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/michael_ruse_probably_wont_be.php"&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/burning_stupid_and_hypocrisy.php"&gt;See&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video 1: Jon Stewart addresses Obama's town hall meeting by carefully refuting the central point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also now know that white people and non-white people always have the ability to have a discussion on equal planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is cool: a meeting at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln &lt;a href="http://www.physics.unl.edu/~wophy/info.shtml"&gt;for outstanding women undergraduates in physics&lt;/a&gt;. I like this idea; it’s not too much after this part of the career path that we start to see an attrition of women in the sciences, so something that fosters their enthusiasm and encourages young women &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/09/international-womens-day/"&gt;is something&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/04/model-scientists/"&gt;like seeing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk and participated in a teacher workshop at UNL a couple of years ago and had a great time; it’s a nice town and a good group of folks there. If you’re a female physics major (or know one you should tell) this looks like a great opportunity to meet others. Registration is open now and the meeting starts October 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And probably you wondered why there were no &lt;i&gt;Protestant&lt;/i&gt; mutual funds.  Well, a couple of Oklahomans &lt;a href="http://newsok.com/financial-advisers-ask-what-would-jesus-do/article/3393177"&gt;had the same idea&lt;/a&gt;, and are launching ETFs to capture that unaddressed demand:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;FaithShares Trust, established by Tom Phillips and Garrett Stevens, will offer shares of exchange traded funds based on indexes that track recommendations of organizations representing Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and nondenominational Christian groups. The funds will include large-cap stocks, excluding those that conflict with core beliefs of the various denominations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the doctrinal differences between the various groups suggest substantially different investment strategies?  Apparently so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the index designed for Baptists will invest no money in companies that produce alcohol of any kind, Phillips said. For Catholics, companies that make beer and wine are allowed, but not those that produce distilled alcohol, he said. The Methodist fund will not invest in any company that produces more than 10 percent of its revenue through alcohol production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects, of course, the Methodist teaching that god doesn’t want you to earn more than 10% of your income in alcohol-related activities (for instance, bartending, stripping, and long-haul truck driving).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look through the prospectus, you can tease out other denominational variations as well.  For instance, Baptists are adamantly opposed to “defense,” Catholics like to invest in “human dignity,” Lutherans don’t want their money going toward nuclear weapons (though biological and chemical are presumably OK), Methodists look to invest in companies that “nurture community,” and non-denominational Christians refuse to make money off “anti-personnel land mines.”  (I assume pro-personnel land mines remain acceptable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that pretty much every conceivable stock pick is offensive to some religion or another.  Scientologists don’t want to invest in companies that provide mental health benefits to their employees.  Jains won’t invest in companies that make mousetraps or flyswatters or those cool blue electric bug zappers that hang in the mess hall at summer camp.  Deists won’t invest in companies whose founders take an ongoing role in management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why, just to be safe, I’ve got my portfolio 25% in gold, 25% in canned vegetables, 25% in Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and 25% in Beanie Babies.  Although now I’m starting to wonder if hanging on to that mint condition Forky the Devil is such a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250446965995"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8103937222512924209">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d51c3456dc1e31e7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Clergy Letter Project aka Compartmentalization</title><published>2009-08-16T17:02:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T17:19:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/_iJOIk4EuVc/clergy-letter-project-aka.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/clergy-letter-project-aka.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">The growing &lt;a href="http://www.butler.edu/clergyproject/rel_evol_sun.htm"&gt;clergy letter project&lt;/a&gt; is, I believe, a fine example of compartmentalization. "We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth."&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Started by a biologist who was fed up with creationism, it has become a safe haven for Christians from critical thought. I agree with fundamentalist Jefferson Reed that the signers of the petition are Apostates who deviate from the plain reading of the Bible. I believe it is nothing more than a cursory way of eliminating cognitive dissonance. One can now feel much more comfortable accepting evolution while maintaining faith simply because thousands of others have publicly done so - never mind that research and critical thought would be a much better way to evaluate whether religion and science are compatible. No one will ever force the different compartments to a debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8103937222512924209?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have an interesting follow-up though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after the original incident, I had occasion to be in Holbrook, Arizona. For breakfast, I decided to eat at - you guessed it - Denny's.

That estimate is based the percentage of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a/an&lt;/em&gt; in a recent Language Log post, "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1657"&gt;Stupid canine lexical acquisition claims&lt;/a&gt;", 8/12/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we shouldn't get too excited about our success in correctly sexing Geoff: the same process, applied to Sarah Palin's recent "Death Panel" facebook post ("&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=113851103434"&gt;Statement on the Current Health Care Debate&lt;/a&gt;", 8/7/2009),  estimates her probability of being male at 56%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#39;s easy to make jokes about this, it&amp;#39;s based on a solid and interesting result.  A recent survey (Newman, M.L., Groom, C.J., Handelman, L.D., &amp;amp; Pennebaker, J.W., &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Reprints/NewmanSexDif2007.pdf"&gt;Gender differences in language use: An analysis of 14,000 text samples&lt;/a&gt;",   &lt;em&gt;Discourse Processes&lt;/em&gt;, 45:211-236, 2008) looked at more than 50 "linguistic dimensions", and the difference in use of &lt;em&gt;the/a/an&lt;/em&gt; was one of the largest sex differences found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, in a post on "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1650"&gt;Linguistic analysis in social science&lt;/a&gt;", I observed that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Traditional mass media are now nearly all digital; new media are documenting (and creating) social interactions at extraordinary scale and depth; more and more historical records are available in digital form.  The digital shadow-universe is a more and more complete proxy for the real one. And in the areas that matter to the social sciences, much of the content of this digital universe exists in the form of digital text and speech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I argued, data based on the analysis of speech and language will play an increasingly large role in the social sciences.  The relevant effects are generally small ones, but they&amp;#39;re easy to measure, and when properly characterized and measured, they can be quite reliable. Furthermore, they&amp;#39;re similar in magnitude to effects measured with much greater trouble and expense using traditional social-science methods like surveys and tests. So for today&amp;#39;s lunch experiment™ (I was busy with other things over breakfast…) I thought I&amp;#39;d see if I could replicate Newman et al.&amp;#39;s  result on sex differences in article usage, using a completely different data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's get clear on what Newman et al. found. Their abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Differences in the ways that men and women use language have long been of interest in the study of discourse. Despite extensive theorizing, actual empirical investigations have yet to converge on a coherent picture of gender differences in language. A significant reason is the lack of agreement over the best way to analyze language. In this research, gender differences in language use were examined using standardized categories to analyze a database of over 14,000 text files from 70 separate studies. Women used more words related to psychological and social processes. Men referred more to object properties and impersonal topics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary table of dimensions and effect sizes is on pages 19-20, reproduced for your convenience &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Newman2008Table1.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The results for percentages of &lt;em&gt;the/a/an&lt;/em&gt;, in particular, were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;Female mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Male mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Effect Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;6.00 (2.73)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;6.70 (2.94)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;d = -.24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "effect size" here is estimated using "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d"&gt;Cohen's d&lt;/a&gt;", which is the difference in means divided by the pooled standard deviation.  This difference in article-use percentage is on the large side, not only among sexual-textual characteristics, but also among cognitive sex differences in general, for example the measures of verbal ability in meta-analytic studies like Janet Shibley Hyde and Marcia C. Linn, "&lt;a href="http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/104/1/53.html"&gt;Gender Differences in Verbal Ability: A Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;, 104:1 53-69 (1988).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on the interpretation of effect sizes in general, see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/003607.html"&gt;Gabby guys: the effect size&lt;/a&gt;", 9/23/2006. In this case, if we assume that the distribution of article-use percentages by sex is "normal", then over a large collection of writing-samples, the cited means and standard deviations would yield a distribution of percentages like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NewmanArticleSex1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NewmanArticleSex1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to be clear that this is not a very big effect, when you look at it from the point of view of men and women as individuals.  Since the correlation ("Pearson's r") is related to Cohen's d as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;r = d/sqrt(d^2 + 1/(p*q))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(where p and q are the proportions of the two groups being compared), and since their sample was about 58% female, the correlation between sex and article use should be about r =  0.119 — and thus the percent of variance in article use that is accounted for by sex, in their dataset, is about r^2 = 1.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it from the other side, you'd have around a 55% chance of guessing sex from the percentage of &lt;em&gt;the/a/an&lt;/em&gt; in random examples drawn from a population with equal numbers of males and females exhibiting these distributions of article-usage by sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are bigger differences due to genre and topic — the rate of &lt;em&gt;the/a/an&lt;/em&gt; usage in formal written text will generally be much higher than in informal conversation, for example, and the expected magnitude of that difference is more than twice as great as the sex effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this sex difference in article usage (like other perceptual and cognitive sex differences) doesn't provide any meaningful scientific support (in my opinion) for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=Leonard+Sax"&gt;Dr. Leonard Sax's single-sex-education movement&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, differences of this magnitude can be quite important in some contexts. This much of an edge in investing or gambling, for example, would be a reliable source of income. Similarly, in politics or in marketing, effects of this size can be highly useful. (I don't mean that article-usage distributions &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; are of any interest to investers, politicos, or marketeers; but other reliable effects of this size certainly would be.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a correlation of about 0.12 is right in the mix, for effects in published social-science research. Compared to the values in a recent meta-analysis (F.D. Richard, C.F. Bond, and J.J. Stokes-Zoota, "&lt;a href="http://www.psych.ubc.ca/%7Eschaller/Psyc591Readings/Richard2003.pdf"&gt;One hundred years of social psychology quantitatively described&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Review of General Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, 2003), it's below the mean, but above the mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This article compiles results from a century of social psychological research, more than 25,000 studies of 8 million people. A large number of social psychological conclusions are listed alongside meta-analytic information about the magnitude and variability of the corresponding effects. References to 322 meta-analyses of social psychological phenomena are presented, as well as statistical effect-size summaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of r values that they found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/SocialPsychMetaCorr.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, on to the replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to show that this effect is reliable and easy to calculate, I took the transcripts and speaker demographics from the &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2004T19"&gt;Fisher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005T19"&gt;Corpus&lt;/a&gt; of conversational speech, a collection of more than 10,000 telephone conversations lasting up to 10 minutes each, recorded in 2003-2004 and published by the LDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 9,789 conversational sides spoken by males, I found 9,409,848 words, of which 471,820 were the/a/an, for an overall percentage of 5.01%. In 13,007 conversational sides produced by females, there were 12,186,985 words spoken, including 554,827 articles, for an overall percentage of 4.55%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These percentages are lower than in Newman et al.'s overall tabulation, as we expect given that this is informal conversation rather than written text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the distribution of percentages across speakers? Here's a graphical representation of what I found (0.2%-wide bins from 0.1% to 10.1%):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FisherSexArticles1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FisherSexArticles1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's a table of the summary statistics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;Female mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Male mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Effect Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;4.47 (1.16)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;4.89 (1.27)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;d = -.34&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the effect is in the same direction, and the effect size is somewhat larger, consistent with Newman et al.'s observation that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Although these effects were largely consistent across different contexts, the pattern of variation suggests that gender differences are larger on tasks that place fewer constraints on language use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing is that this kind of analysis is now very easy to do. Starting from the raw Fisher-corpus transcripts and metadata files, writing and running the (gawk and R) scripts for this replication took me 17 minutes of wall clock time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't tried to persuade you that this effect is an interesting one, only that it's reliable (in the aggregate), comparable in size to many traditional social-psychological measures, and easy to compute. Though something might be learned by trying to figure out where this phenomenon comes from, it seems to me that it shouldn't be seen as an end in itself, but rather a feature that might help us understand other social and psychological differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of features that can now be calculated in similarly trivial ways. (And the resulting distributions show large age, class, and mood effects as well as sex effects, as Jamie Pennebaker and others have found — are there also effects of political philosophy, for example?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more text and speech become available, as better and more sophicated automatic analyzers are developed (such as those involved in "&lt;a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/%7Eliub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html"&gt;sentiment analysis&lt;/a&gt;"), and as the modeling of feature distributions in these larger datasets becomes more sophisticated, it's inevitable that the scope of such research will become broader, and the number of studies will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the social value and intellectual interest of these studies will also increase — and I&amp;#39;ll try to persuade you, in occasional future posts, that this is already happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: D.O. in the comments &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1667#comment-40293"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about pronoun percentages. The numbers from Newman et al. are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;Female mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Male mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Effect Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;14.24% (4.06)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;12.69% (4.63)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;d = 0.36&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure that I've replicated their calculations exactly, because I'm not certain my list of pro-forms is the same as theirs. But for what it's worth, here's what I get for the Fisher data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;Female mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Male mean (stddev)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Effect Size&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;16.155% (2.352)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;15.496% (2.531)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;d = 0.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the graphical version:&lt;/p&gt;

He really chokes over my name, doesn't he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's not interesting. What is bizarre is this photo and question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where were these taken?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/creepy_ol_ken_ham/licenseplates.jpeg" width="400" height="424" alt="licenseplates.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer: In the AiG parking lot when the 285 atheists visited.  As one looks at the messages on these bumper stickers, we need to pray for these very lost people who so desperately need the Lord.  Actually, I believe some of these messages really do reflect what the devil offered Adam and Eve in Genesis 3, &amp;quot;you shall become as gods…&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is creepy on two levels: that Ken Ham sent his goons out to photograph the cars of visitors, which speaks of a very deep paranoia, and that he finds these simple bumper stickers to be satanic. He needs to pray for people who voted for Obama? People who value ethics and doing good are desperate need of the lord?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neighbor&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, it’s church. We go to a really nice church down the street and I have heard you and your boyfriend talking about being atheists, but I figure your son might still want to see what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a couple of weeks ago, another Obama-is-the-Antichrist campaign started up again. This time it came in the form of a viral &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXMAnlMmEPw"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; which claims that Jesus was quoted in the Gospel according to Luke to have revealed the name of the Antichrist.  This a accomplished with the help of some cryptic association of the president’s first and last name when rendered in Aramaic, combined with bad Hebrew pronunciation, gleamed from a text written in Greek. I will leave it up to &lt;a href="http://michaelsheiser.com/PaleoBabble/2009/07/more-pulpit-paleobabble-president-obama-is-the-antichrist-the-bible-tells-us-so/"&gt;Mike Heiser, host of the PaleoBabble blog&lt;/a&gt;,  Academic Editor for Bible Study Magazine, who is no fan of the President but has expertise in Hebrew and Aramaic to debunk this latest bunk.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am particularly interested in this recent silliness about our President being the Antichrist is that as a native Chinese speaker, I am familiar with how easy it is to make wild associations with names when transliterated to another language. It is difficult if not impossible to phonetically represent non-Chinese names in Chinese without imparting some unintended meaning to the name. The Chinese language is tonal and monosyllabic and in written form, a single character represents a concept with a unique sound.  As an example, a simple name like “Mary” is represented by two Chinese characters with the sound of “Ma” and “Li” (with no “r” sound character, the “l” will have to do.) So “Mary” is transliterated as “Ma-Li.”  The best possible outcome for making up names is for the characters with the proper sounds when strung together to make no sense at all or to mean something pleasant or good.  That’s not always possible.  “Ma” is “horse.”  “Li” is “good omen” or “tongue” depending on the character used.  So, the name “Mary” in Chinese can mean a “Good omen horse” or “Horse’s tongue.”  Now, imagine a multi-syllabic name like “Roosevelt.”  The standard Chinese rendering of this presidential name is with three characters: “Lor – See – Fook.”  It’s meaningless but with only slight tonal shift, it can mean “Gong Buttocks.”  I understand that Chinese newspapers have settled on President Obama’s name as “Oh – Barn – Ma.” In Cantonese the 3 characters used sounds like “Australian Striped Horse or Zebra. Now, go have fun with it!  Every kid in Chinese school history classes have enjoyed many giggling fits with historical Western names rendered in Chinese characters – they range from funny to downright vulgar depending on what character is used to get the sound!  A quick check with my mom’s Chinese newspapers showed that they have given up on trying to render Nancy Pelosi’s name in Chinese – they just print her name in alphabets. There is just no graceful way to get a Chinese version of “Nancy” without sounding awkward and even awful! Most Chinese political cartoons or jokes involve punning with a politician’s name, substituting a character with another of the same sound but giving the name a whole new meaning. This phonetic mangling of names, intentional or otherwise is ubiquitous. A Vietnamese immigrant family with a last name of “Phuc” is well advised to change it if they don’t want their children to be butt of jokes in school!  The reason I have spent so much ink explaining the difficulty of representing  a name in a foreign language is to illustrate how disingenuous and desperate the Antichrist crowd is to have to resort to phonetically deconstructing the President’s name in Hebrew, quoted from an Aramaic speaker, recorded in Kione Greek 1,900 years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise that this particular application of linguistic ignorance to make a bad theological case for whatever suits ones prejudice can get traction so easily in monolingual America.  A vast majority of the population have no competence in a foreign language and therefore have little appreciation for subtle linguistic nuances and how barely noticeable tonal variations in pronunciation are not just minor regional accent difference but can change meanings of words and sentences. With the help of a sprinkling of Hebrew numerology, true believers can have fun creating conspiracy theories by quote-mining the Old and New Testaments.  So, for the next four (or eight) years, this kind of exercise with gematria, conflation of Hebrew, Aramaic &amp;amp; Greek and mutilation of other Semitic languages will continue in full force to make the case that Barack Hussein Obama is indeed the Antichrist. (Notice the 6 letters in each name – hence 666, the number of the Beast – it’s just too easy! Oh, but wait, “Hussein” has 7 letters!  No, it’s only 6 letters when spelled in Greek … and on .. and on .. and on…)  Apocalyptic expectation of Armageddon has always been a fixture on the landscape of American culture and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am old enough to remember reading about the Antichrist and the End Times way back in the 1970s, featuring Hal Lindsey, Jerry Jenkins, Tim LaHaye and hoards of co-religionists cashing in with books, lectures and videos.  They were assuring us all, with exactly the same rhetoric and tortured exegesis as today’s apocalypticists that the Antichrist would unify Europe, promise peace, and start the Battle of Armageddon with the help of the USSR.  Remember the USSR?  And what happened to all of Lindsey’s, LaHaye’s and Jenkins’ predictions? Nothing. The Late Great Planet Earth will end in 1988? Not!  How about NASA engineer Edgar Whisenant’s “88 reasons Why the Rapture will be in 1988”? Not! (Just goes to show that being an engineer does not inoculate one from being a looney coo-coo!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the current generation of Antichrist-Is-Already-Here, Rapture-Is-Eminent proselytizers ever read history? Is it possible they did not know of the long list of world leaders who had been branded as the Antichrist over the last 60 years; Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, various popes, Mao Tse-Tung,  Anwar Sadat, Saddam Hussein, Sun Myung-Moon, Henry Kissinger  to just name a few. Oh, let’s not forget Mikhail Gorbachev, with a birthmark on his head that every eschatologist was so damn sure was the “mark of the beast” mentioned in Revelation.  These Apocalypse-Now Chicken Littles deserve to be scorned and mocked for their prediction track record of 100% failure rate. Check out a few webpages for a small sampling. Here’s a list of predictions for &lt;a href="http://www.abhota.info/end3.htm"&gt;1971-1997 which failed&lt;/a&gt;.  Here’s a list of predictions for &lt;a href="http://www.abhota.info/end4.htm"&gt;1998-1999 which failed&lt;/a&gt;. And here’s a list of predictions for &lt;a href="http://www.abhota.info/end5.htm"&gt;2000-2005 which failed&lt;/a&gt;.  So, why are so many attracted to this Antichrist, Rapture, Armageddon Apocalyptic worldview? And why are they all unabashedly prepared to be wrong again and again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally in my more charitable mood, I can convince myself that these true-believers must have taken Martin Luther’s &lt;em&gt;Sola Scriptura&lt;/em&gt; directive to heart but are intellectually deficient to understand what they are reading when they try to read the Bible on their own. They lacked the inquisitiveness to acquire the necessarily scholarship on the history and cultural backdrop of a very complex narrative about a region and time so alien to them. They ended up creating a new religion based on misshapen symbolism and misdirected allegories, and in doing so, committed idolatry which the Bible had warned against in the first place. How else can anyone explain Lindsey’s claim that a first century narrative of desert locusts was really a foretelling of helicopter gunships twenty centuries later in a Middle Eastern desert?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I am less magnanimous I dismiss all these eschatological stuff as having nothing to do with Biblical interpretation. The people involved really don’t think the End Time is near. They enjoy fantasizing about it because they know it’s not true and delight in mentally constructing outrageous improbably scenarios just for the kick of it to see how far out they can push the story.  It’s the equivalent of all those letters-to-the-editor sexual escapades in men’s magazines – guys reading them know none of it is true but nevertheless they get a kick out of reading it anyway because they wish it could happen to them. Speculating about who the next Antichrist is and when the Rapture will happen is theological pornography for these believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a more somber and sober consideration which should not be ignored is that this constant proof-texting and data-mining, backed by twisted and unscholarly hermeneutics to make the case for the appearance of the Antichrist and place the Rapture within our life time may be perpetrated by a bunch of pathological social misfits who cannot comprehend or cope with the modern world.  Stuck in a fast-changing world that they can neither fit in nor care to, they take solace in wishing for and fantasizing about the end of that world with the gory and fiery destruction of people they hate.  The cynic in me thinks that the modern day Antichrist movement may be invented by a bunch of lazy believers who felt compelled to do God’s work but then found it too demanding, and by believing that the world is going to end soon will make their being Christians easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a Biblical scholar and will admit that after reading the Bible from Genesis to Revelation more times than any science geek should admit to, I still don’t know what the Book of Revelation is really about. All I know is that in recent years it’s been adopted as a canon within a canon by the lunatic fringes of the Religious Right and the Anarchic Left (Yes, many “liberation theologians” hate the U.S. and have America labelled as the Antichrist.)  It has also acted as magnet for and gives aid and comfort to the deranged such as Jim Jones, and psychotics like David Koresh, and greedy charlatans like Elizabeth Clare Prophet, to make wild apocalyptic pronouncements and to see an Antichrist coming around every corner. I am assured by many friends and relatives who are sincere and devout Christians that they have no need for this End Times stuff in their quest for communion with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoters of Obama-is-the-Antichrist polemics are not even funny – at least the “birther” are so comically incompetent they are laughable.  They may not like the fact that he won the election; they may disagree with his policies and they may hate his Supreme Court appointee but procuring their eschatological viewpoint from reading the Left Behind series and then clamoring to make the case that he’s the Antichrist is asylum-worthy and should disqualify them from the arena of political discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And please don’t get me started on the Mayan Calendar 2012 apocalypse – this bombastic nonsense is not even at the level of bunk to be worth debunking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For those interested in reading books about the Book of Revelation written by biblical scholars (of which Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins and Hal Lindsey are definitely not,) I recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Read the Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; by Jean-Pierre Prevost, gives an overview of the symbolism, numbers, historical context of all the important characters and story lines in the Book of Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Views on the Book of Revelation&lt;/em&gt; is a book by four different Evangelical authors, each explaining one of the four dominant Evangelical presentation of the Book. It’s a college level text book and definitely not for casual reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paperback Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; is a non-academic book by Robert M. Price, a professor of New Testament and Systemic Theology.  With the subtitle “How the Christian Church Was Left Behind,” Prof. Price makes no apologies for that fact that he wrote this book as an antidote to the LaHaye-Jenkins “Left Behind” series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arguing the Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen O’leary.  This book examines and analyzes in detail two specific End Times predictions that failed – The Millerites (predecessors of today’s Seven Day Adventists) of mid-19 Century and the LaHaye-Jenkins phenomenon of the 1970s and 1980.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Yau-Man Chan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250440498667"><id gr:original-id="http://theyorf.blogspot.com/2009/08/investigating-smallest-bacterial-genome.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3447737e6c19e5dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Investigating the Smallest Bacterial Genome</title><published>2009-08-16T09:54:48Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T09:54:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/2zpfpgoPABc/investigating-smallest-bacterial-genome.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://theyorf.blogspot.com/2009/08/investigating-smallest-bacterial-genome.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">During the first two terms of my final year at university I took on a dry project based on bacterial genetics. In retrospect this was quite a cheap move since it avoids so many of the problems involved in normal lab work, but in my defence it was the project that interested me most and I really wanted some computing experience before making PhD applications.  My work was based on bacterial endosymbionts of insects, which have been of recent interest due to their extremely small genomes. Bacteria in these symbiotic relationships are given a protected, nutrient-rich environment and in return they allow insects to survive on unbalanced diets by synthesising scarce biomolecules.

Primary endosymbiotic bacteria live their entire lives inside insects and are vertically transmitted from generation to generation, a process that leads to coevolution between the bacteria and the insect. One of the results of this coevolution was major changes to the original bacterial genome, which contained many genes that are essential for free-living bacteria but are unnecessary for life within an insect. Consequently, common features of endosymbiotic genomes compared to those of free-living bacteria are severe gene loss, genome compaction and skewing of GC content.

My project focused on Carsonella ruddii, the only bacterial endosymbiont of the psyllid, Pachypsylla venusta. It was hailed as the smallest bacterial genome chracterised when it was sequenced in 2006 and still holds that record. Its genome contains only 182 ORFs, less than 3% intergenic DNA and has a GC content of 16.5%. The bacteria appears to be provided with many nutrients by its host and its metabolism has been reduced to a few pathways: ATP synthesis, a section of the pentose phosphate pathway and biosynthesis of certain amino acids.  

The early stages of my project involved a reannotation of the C. ruddii genome followed by a sequence-based functional analysis of its metabolic enzymes. Using the enzymes deemed functional in this analysis I built an updated model of the C. ruddii metabolism which could be divided into six pathways involved in amino acid biosynthesis, five of which were incomplete. The only fully intact pathway led to the production of isoleucine and valine. These are both essential amino acids for insects and are severely under-represented in the adult psyllid diet.

Four of the incomplete amino acid pathways were missing only one reaction and the conservation of the rest of each of the pathways suggested that they might still be functional in C. ruddii. The ‘missing’ reactions might occur spontaneously under some conditions or could be catalysed by unidentified enzymes. For three of these four missing reactions I found an example in the literature of a different bacterial endosymbiont which had lost that reaction but had retained the rest of the pathway. This seemed to suggest that the enzymes catalysing these reactions might be expendable and subject to loss during genome reduction in endosymbionts. Based on this and some other evidence from similar sit...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

As a result, I have virtually no experience of what it would be like to be illiterate.  It would be easier for me to imagine blindness than complete inability to read.  I did have a glimpse of it when I first spent some time in Japan, and was surrounded by an advanced culture using an utterly alien writing system in which I couldn't even read out the names off the signs (as I can in any of the alphabets of Europe).  But I had another glimpse this morning when I heard a word on the radio that I couldn't guess how to spell, not even vaguely.  Tracking it down was a terrible job.  My dictionary was no help, precisely because dictionaries are organized in such a way as to be helpful only to the literate.  The great naturalist Sir David Attenborough, on Radio 4, mentioned a curious-sounding class of animals that he appeared to be calling Sicilians.  (Not a class in the technical terminology; technically they are actually a whole separate &lt;b&gt;order&lt;/b&gt; of animals.) I listened carefully; it definitely sounded like "Sicilians".  But what was this word?  These creatures (he made it clear) did not live in Sicily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I went to the &lt;i&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/i&gt; (I wanted to know the meaning and learn about the animals that had the name, so I used a hard-copy dictionary that includes pictures), and simply examined all the words in the dictionary that had anything like a plausible beginning.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only letters that can represent the [s] sound are &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;.  (Just in case, I checked &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;z&lt;/b&gt;, which actually represent [z] when initial; I thought perhaps I had misheard the voicing.  But I had not; it was a blind alley, and I will ignore it hereafter.  People have pointed out to me since I wrote this that the silent &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt; words like &lt;i&gt;psychology&lt;/i&gt; reveal another possibility.  True.  But it turned out not to be relevant.)  The vowel letters that could represent [&lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt;] after [s] would be &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;  as in &lt;i&gt;city&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;sit&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt; as in &lt;i&gt;cyst&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;system&lt;/i&gt;, and just possibly (in an unstressed syllable) &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt; as in &lt;i&gt;Cecilia&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;serenity&lt;/i&gt;.  It couldn't be &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;, because before those letters a &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; stands for the stop consonant [k].  And the third sound, the second [s], could be spelled (for all I knew) &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;ss&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I came up with zip.  Nada.  Nichts.  Nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There I was, illiterate in English (while holding the position of head of the top Linguistics and English Language department in the U.K. — what a fraud!), fumbling through the dictionary, unable to find a word — solely because dictionaries are organized entirely on the assumption that you know how to spell, at least to an approximation.  I found no sign of the word at all, in any of the relevant places.  I simply couldn&amp;#39;t remember this happening to me before.  Most unpleasant.  So this is how adult illiteracy feels.  Dictionaries become useless.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do have a fair command of Unix tools, and those, used appropriately, can dramatically reduce your feelings of illiteracy and inadequacy.  I knew that what I had to find was in the set of all words that would match the &lt;b&gt;egrep&lt;/b&gt; regular expression: "&lt;b&gt;^[cs][iey](c|ss?)&lt;/b&gt;".  That is, I wanted to see a list of any words beginning with &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; followed by &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt; followed by either &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; or else &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; with perhaps a second &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; after that.  (To allow for &lt;b&gt;ps-&lt;/b&gt;, the expression could be modified to "&lt;b&gt;^(ps|[cs])[iey](c|ss?)&lt;/b&gt;".  Doesn't make any difference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On any Unix system you can use the &lt;b&gt;egrep&lt;/b&gt; program to produce an exhaustive list of all of them by searching the standard word list in &lt;b&gt;/usr/share/dict/words&lt;/b&gt; (it is &lt;b&gt;/usr/dict/words&lt;/b&gt; on some systems).  In fact you can make &lt;b&gt;egrep&lt;/b&gt; give you a list of all the words that begin the right way and include an &lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt; (there had to be one of those in the word) and ends in &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; plus (just possibly) a silent &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;.  So I tried the magic of &lt;b&gt;egrep&lt;/b&gt;. I typed this to the prompt in the Terminal program on my Mac OS X laptop:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;tt&gt;egrep "^[cs][iey](c|ss?)[a-z]*l[a-z]*ne?$" /usr/dict/share/words&lt;/tt&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the results were disappointing: the four words it comes up with are &lt;i&gt;cyclone&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyclopean&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyclotron&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;seclusion&lt;/i&gt;.  No plausible candidates there.  Where the hell was this zoological word that sounded just like &lt;i&gt;Sicilian&lt;/i&gt; that I had never heard before and that couldn't be found in an excellent dictionary or in the Unix standard word list?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to a larger word list.  There is a 235,000-word list in a file called &lt;b&gt;/usr/dict/web2&lt;/b&gt; that is now supplied with many Unix and Linux systems (it is linked to &lt;b&gt;/usr/dict/share/words&lt;/b&gt; on some of those), and I tried out this command:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;tt&gt;egrep "^[cs][iey](c|ss?)[a-z]*l[a-z]*ne?$" /usr/dict/web2&lt;/tt&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I still drew a blank.  I found out later that the word is in there, but the above command will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; find it.  It produces this list of 45 words (which reveals to you why &lt;b&gt;web2&lt;/b&gt; is often less useful than the shorter list — it is way too big, and contains all sorts of learned and scientific junk):  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turned out that I was missing something.  Eventually I did track the word down, by a less orthodox technique, not based on the alphabet.  And then I knew the crucial orthographic fact about English that I had been overlooking.  It didn't seem so arcane once I reached that point.  But until then it was completely opaque to me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain…  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No; on second thoughts, I don't have a lot more time right now, and it will be fun for you trying to figure it out.  I will tell you tomorrow, and I'll explain how I tracked down the word.&lt;/p&gt;

Dunn is regarded worldwide as one of today's foremost biblical scholars, and in a real sense one of my intellectual heroes.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was an apologetics instructor I used his book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidence-Jesus-James-D-Dunn/dp/0664246982/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250430191&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Evidence for Jesus&lt;/a&gt; in that class. It’s very small but mighty. It put to shame other available books at that time. I loved it so much I bought up several copies to hand out. I’m selling my last spare copy on Amazon now. Another book of his, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Living-Word-James-D-Dunn/dp/0800663551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250430088&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Living Word&lt;/a&gt;, changed my thinking. After reading it I could no longer affirm inerrancy, I began thinking Jesus was a liberal and was introduced into the problem of Pseudonymity and canonical criticism like never before. I bought several copies of this book to hand out as well. I have two left. I see it’s now made it to a second edition recently (2009) and I heartily recommend it too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another of my intellectual heroes was James Barr who wrote a devastating critique of fundamentalism which to this day is probably unsurpassed, called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Fundamentalism-James-Barr/dp/0664246206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250430325&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Beyond Fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;. I bought up several copies of this book to pass out too, and I’m selling my last two copies on Amazon. This book literally shatters fundamentalism I think. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they do not go far enough. Read for yourselves what James D. G. Dunn admitted in what will prove to be Dunn’s magnum opus series of books, beginning with volume one, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Remembered-Christianity-Making-Vol/dp/0802839312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250430019&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Jesus Remembered&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Jesus' own experience of anointing and ministry empowered by the same Spirit/power of God may in itself have convinced him that God's longed-for (final) manifestation of his royal rule was already in evidence and that its full manifestation could therefore not be long delayed... The point is that such treatments have found it impossible to deny that Jesus had expressed expectation for the imminent happening of events which did not happen. Jesus' kingdom preaching cannot be disentangled from imminent expectation, with or without 'apocalyptic' features. Which also means that Jesus had entertained hopes which were not fulfilled. There were 'final' elements in his expectation which were not realized. &lt;strong&gt;Putting it bluntly, Jesus was proved wrong by the course of events&lt;/strong&gt;” (p. 479).&lt;/blockquote&gt;What I don’t get is how these critically honest scholars could come to these &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt; conclusions and still profess to be followers of Christ (i.e. Christians). I think anyone with intellectual honesty should jump ship like I have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8210324104807245030?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Levenson, Professor at Harvard Divinity School in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and Civilizations, offered a great definition of what a critical scholar is when he wrote they “&lt;strong&gt;are prepared to interpret the text against their own preferences and traditions, in the interest of intellectual honesty.&lt;/strong&gt;” See page 3 of his book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Resurrection-Beloved-Son-Transformation/dp/0300065116/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250430411&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son&lt;/a&gt;. In that book he argues that "only at a particular stage rather late in the history of Israel was child sacrifice branded as counter to the will of YHWH and thus ipso facto idolatrous" (p. 5). Why shouldn't all Biblical scholars be critical scholars?&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3783227471683362731?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It was just a place to stop on the way to Hot Springs, Arkansas.  I had the name of a cheap motel and a vague idea of where it was.  But I kept getting lost.  Every time I came to about where this major street was supposed to be, there was a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; street there.  What the hell was going on?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the fifth time I came to the right/wrong location, it dawned on me ... "Elvis Presley Boulevard" must have just recently been named as such ... &lt;/p&gt;

The Australian skeptics &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/08/16/vaccine-fear-campaign-to-be-investigated/"&gt;are still hammering away&lt;/a&gt; at Meryl Dorey, the Australian Vaccination Network, and their (to be charitable) distortions of the truth. It’s nice to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; seen is that, like a pinata when that critical blow is made, a torrent of dumbosity comes out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings up an interesting point. A lot of people think that using an a&lt;em&gt;d hominem&lt;/em&gt; — an argument that attacks the person and not the issue –is a logical fallacy. That’s not necessarily the case. For example, if someone on the street walks up to me and say, &amp;quot;Aliens speaking with the voice of Glenn Beck are sitting on my shoulders and forcing me to eat brussel sprouts, and Obama’s health care plan will set up death panels,&amp;quot; then there is some merit in questioning the person’s sanity before wondering if what they say about the health care plan is true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re inclined to give Meryl Dorey and her AVN group the benefit of the doubt, &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/vaccines-are-part-of-a-world-wide-plot-to-commit-mass-genocide-this-is-not-a-conspiracy/"&gt;you might want to read up on some of the other, um, &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; they believe&lt;/a&gt;. It may open your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250433472222"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=4004">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e0b7a01a5897b301</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Sunday miscellany</title><published>2009-08-16T13:47:27Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T13:47:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/16/sunday-miscellany/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m off to the UK for a week for the &lt;a href="http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/"&gt;Edinburgh Book Festival&lt;/a&gt;, where I’ll talk about about the evidence for evolution (in a joint session with Nick Lane, author of &lt;em&gt;Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution&lt;/em&gt;), and — in a second venue — debate a theologian and a philosopher about the difference between belief in evolution and belief in God and religion.  The estimable Greg Mayer will be handling the website when I’m gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to mention three articles before I go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/the-vision-lives-on.html"&gt;last week’s edition of &lt;em&gt;Science and the Sacred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(the venue for “leaders of the BioLogos Foundation”), Darrel Falk, a biologist at Point Loma Nazarene University and &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/about/team"&gt;co-President of BioLogos&lt;/a&gt;, says goodbye to Francis Collins as a member of the Foundation.  He also takes a swipe at atheists for making their work harder. His words fall into the familiar pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that a group concerned about the advancement of scientific ideals is our most vocal opponent? We support science, including the science of evolutionary biology. We think this incongruity implies that for them the issue is not the preservation of science in our fragile world. For them, the issue is that they want to use scientific data to justify their own political and philosophical ends. They are trying to present science as claiming something it does not claim to justify their nontheistic view of the world. They want to rid the world of philosophies grounded in theism. It is clear from their writing that they have taken no time to carefully study the host of philosophers who are theists or the elegant theology of some of the world’s finest minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I really want to point out is Falk’s inadvertent highlighting of the difference between science and faith.  For in his piece Falk considers the question, “is there any potential finding of science that would cause me to lose faith”?  The answer, of course, is no, NOTHING could ever make him abandon his Christianity. As he notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if it turns out that our sense of right and wrong emerges through natural selection and other natural processes that can be explained through science–and I personally suspect this will be the case — it does not in any way imply the absence of a personal God. The Creator, after all, may well function through natural selection in some manner that the scientific process is not equipped to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if it turns out that the human mind emerges from molecules interacting in a manner that can all be explained through the physical properties of matter — which I also suspect is the case — this in no way implies the absence of a God whose existence is necessary for that mind to come into being. It also has nothing to say about whether there is a God who interacts mind-to-mind with those persons who seek that interaction. Even if the cell and the information it contains is explicable through natural processes, this does not in any way imply the absence of God’s Spirit “hovering” (Genesis 1:2) and thereby influence the outcome in some manner beyond exploration by scientific tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the most contentious issues don’t undermine core tenets of evangelicalism. Many brilliant persons have reached the conclusion that there is good reason to believe in a God who works in creation, a God whose action is beyond the realm of scientific testability. (See this earlier &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/05/a-rational-belief.html"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we have the real difference between faith and science, for, unlike faith, science &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; answer the question, “How would I know if I were wrong?”  And if you can’t answer that question, how can you know if you are &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Falk mentions with approbation &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/07/a-call-for-peace-in-the-sciencefaith-battle.html"&gt;a piece by Mooney and Kirshenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, called “A Call for Peace in the Science/Faith Battle,” that also appeared on the same BioLogos-sponsored website on July 27.  You don’t have to read this essay, because you already know what it says: the usual indictment of shrill atheists, P.Z.-and-Dawkins bashing, world without end.  What is interesting, though, is that although M&amp;amp;K have relentlessly touted on their website every essay promoting their book, they don’t seem to have mentioned this one.  (I may be wrong, but a search revealed nothing.) Why is that, I wonder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, over at &lt;em&gt;Metamagician and The Hellfire Club&lt;/em&gt;, the ever-civil Russell Blackford has finally &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/2009/08/for-those-who-havent-seen-it-more.html"&gt;lost patience with the twins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colgate Twins have – and should continue to have – every legal right to exhort us to self-censorship, but such self-censorship is not in the public interest, and it is morally reprehensible for them to urge it … rather than simply addressing our arguments on their merits. The twins have moved the debate to a meta-level where our actual arguments are not addressed and we are forced to defend our very right to put them. This is a time-wasting distraction. Worse, we are presented as vicious and violent; we are demonised, rather than being treated as reasonable, peaceful people with a valuable role to play in public debate on serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced by this, we quite properly respond with anger and contempt. There is an appropriate time for those emotions – a time when they are healthy – and this is one of them. The twins have shown that they are not just reasonable people who happen to disagree with us on important issues. That would be fine. But they have no rational arguments relating to the issues of substance; instead, they are purveyors of hatred and bigotry who choose to demonise opponents. They choose to treat us as beyond the pale of substantive discussion of our ideas. Well, we are entitled to say what we think of them; we are also entitled to go on making our substantive points, patiently, civilly, and reasonably, as we have done throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take more than these two privileged nitwits with bright, toothy smiles to get us to shut up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s with a light heart that I depart for that Blessed Plot.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead the usual criminal statute will say that to do [B] shall "be an offence".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means that the police and courts will deal with incidents of [B] in a certain way, and so in turn (if appropriate) will the prison and probation services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To ban something is not the end of a phenomenon, but the introduction of new knock-on effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this is straightforward in the mainstream of criminal activity, the endless and depressing daily tally of dishonest acts and physical assaults. It is also entirely appropriate for the most serious examples of dishonesty and violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am not in the least sentimental about those who engage in serious criminal activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But dealing with mainstream criminality through a grim system of offences and sanctions is not the same as dealing with issues which can (arguably) have wider and contended religious, normative, sexual, or cultural significance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And these can range from drugs to obscene art, from fox hunting to animal experiments, from prostitution to absinthe, and from blasphemy to homosexuality.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes it may well be wrong, and perhaps it really should come to an end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But in my view, nothing is ever really banned by banning it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next time you catch yourself saying "&lt;em&gt;it should be banned&lt;/em&gt;" reflect on whether you merely want it to ended, or whether you really wish it to perhaps continue but be subject to a criminal justice system processing unlucky future incidents of it ever being caught.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-70263473366778216?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250432298716"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-6691735696150464680">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc48817b31335a92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Samuel Johnson" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Blogging" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="George Orwell" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="The Discredited BCA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Why I Blog, or Johnson v Orwell</title><published>2009-08-16T10:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T10:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-i-blog-or-johnson-v-orwell.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">Which literary titan is correct? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samuel Johnson or George Orwell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnson famously said: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Orwell said in &lt;a href="http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why I Write&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, ‘I am going to produce a work of art’. I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spend most of my day writing. And, sadly, Samuel Johnson is largely right about why I do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My day job consists of drafting, revising, and amending lengthy formal legal documents, often contracts. Like many other lawyers, my daily wordcount is probably higher than even the most diligent journalist or novelist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, few people will read the contracts I write, but the contracts have to be correct all the same. For, if a transaction or project goes wrong, and the people involved enter into a dispute, then it will be the contract which will largely determine the outcome of that dispute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody writes such formal lengthy contracts, but for money. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not even blockheads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once my day job is over, I carry on writing, often about legal topics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And - other than $10 from Google Adsense (see the automatic advert, sometimes for a chiropractor or personal injury lawyer, at the bottom of this page) - I have directly never earned a penny from this Blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sometimes - but rarely - do commissioned legal journalism, and I am writing a book about law which I hope somebody publishes and some other people buy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But money does not explain why I do this Blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also do not often Blog about things which simply interest me or matter to me: on politics, skepticism, and law there are Bloggers and MSM journalists who write well about my interests, and there is no good reason to add my echo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I Blog because I want to say something which I have not yet seem elsewhere, or because (usually because of my legal background) I am in the fortunate position of being able to contribute to a debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the last year this has often been in the context of the misconceived libel case brought by the now discredited British Chiropractic Association.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are other areas, from the abuse of police powers to the misapplication of intellectual property law, where I am anxious to one day make contributions to the debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blogging is a wonderful innovation. Before the internet, any attempt to engage in a written debate was always at the behest and whim of an editor and publisher. Now these figures can be by-passed, and one can just click on "publish post".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course some Blogs are better than others, but at least no one is now held back from making a contribution just because of the decision of an editor or publisher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, as for Blogging, Orwell is largely right. The best Blogs make a difference, saying something well and distinctive, perhaps adding new information or a new insight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloggers may well be blockheads, but it is not because they are doing it for money.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-6691735696150464680?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250429992816"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/my_bird_ring.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e2549775eb85100</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">My Bird Ring</title><published>2009-08-16T14:09:54Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T14:09:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/ijfIBlkhzsg/my_bird_ring.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/my_bird_ring.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My son just got back from a happy week on &lt;a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallands_V%C3%A4der%C3%B6"&gt;Hallands Väderö&lt;/a&gt;, a small island nature reserve off the southwestern coast of Sweden. It reminds me of my own visit there at about his age and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_ringing"&gt;bird ring&lt;/a&gt; I found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were staying in Båstad on the mainland for a week, and I remember having a lot of fun despite my parents having a number of violent tearful fights. The worst of them got sparked when I complained about how boring my visit to Hallands Väderö had been: my dad was angry with me for complaining, my mom defended me, and soon they were fighting again -- so I thought it was my fault. And the island's name has remained a sore spot with me since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway, the bird ring. On the island I found the dry leg of a dead bird on the seashore, soft tissue almost gone, sinews still holding it together, foot still covered with skin. And around the lower leg, an aluminium ring with a series of digits and the name of the &lt;a href="http://www.nrm.se/en/frontpage.16_en.html"&gt;Swedish Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stupidly, I hung on to that ring for 15-20 years before sending it to the museum. Better late than never, I guess. And they told me that the bird had been a gull that had received the ring on that very island a few weeks before my visit. A data point in the study of the fate of birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about you, Dear Reader -- have you ever found a bird ring?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/my_bird_ring.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/ijfIBlkhzsg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250427233086"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-481186394446560475">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bb14df5335265fa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Debunking Christianity Carnival" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Debunking Christianity Carnival #1</title><published>2009-08-16T07:53:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T16:58:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/pkWFVTGfD5k/debunking-christianity-carnival-1.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/481186394446560475/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=481186394446560475" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/debunking-christianity-carnival-1.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">A smorgasbord of annotated weblinks.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John recently brought up the subject of &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/praise-god-for-wicked-plants.html"&gt;poisonous plants&lt;/a&gt;.

They are, as anyone who is even vaguely familiar with the laws of thermodynamics and conservation is aware, impossible. The bottom line is that there is no way to create a machine that created energy from nothing. Energy always has to come from somewhere, and at least a little bit of energy has to be wasted in any process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, listener Karen Clow (rhymes with “flow”) asks this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just listened to your 5×5 episode about perpetual motion, and I have a  question.  While I haven’t been able to find it on YouTube, I saw a video a few  months ago that seemed like a form of perpetual motion.  There was a column of  marbles in the center, and the structure holding the column was slightly wider  than the marbles so that instead of a straight-up stack, they rested on top of  one another in a sort of zig-zag pattern.  There was a “track” of sorts starting  form the top of the column, so that a marble went down the track, and when it  reached the bottom, it went into the bottom of the column, forcing the column  up, causing the top marble to go down the track.  I don’t recall anyone claiming  that this was perpetual motion in the traditional sense, it was more of a  “kinetic art” thing (although searching for kinetic art I can only find pieces  which use motors).  I also realize that there would be no way to harness the  energy of the marbles, since any attempt to do so would cause them to slow down  enough that they wouldn’t have enough inertia to force the column upwards.  Is  my memory of this invention flawed?  Is such a thing possible, and if so, would  it not be considered perpetual motion?  Sorry if this is a hoax that’s been  debunked a hundred times over, but nothing about it seemed to be an attempted  hoax, it was more of a curiosity like a fountain but with marbles instead of  water, so I’m really curious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of machines are not the free energy machines that we were talking about.  As Karen points out, they cannot be used to generate energy. If you try to take energy out of the system it will quickly wind down. But can you make a machine that is energy neutral - meaning that it does not create energy but it does not lose energy either, so it can continue indefinitely - perpetual motion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one such device: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to this type of perpetual motion is to eliminate all sources of energy loss - usually friction. Imagine the earth revolving about the sun - this is a type of perpetual, or at least very long-lived, motion. There is little friction is space and the momentum of the earth is precisely balanced by the gravitational force of the earth-sun system so that it is very stable. It is probably more accurate to describe this as a very stable system, rather than perpetual motion, but billions of years is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On earth it is more difficult to create a micro-friction situation. A rolling marble makes noise; that noise represents vibrating air molecules, which takes energy. Therefore noise is carrying energy away from the system. There is also friction with the air, and vibrations in the machine itself. So while a precisely engineered machine may minimize friction and other subtle energy losses, it cannot eliminate it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore most of these perpetual motion machines use another trick to simulate true perpetual motion - they are tapping into a subtle source of energy to replace the slight loss in the system. These are often very clever. Magnets may be used to give a ferromagnetic component a subtle push, just enough to replace losses due to friction. Of course, this takes energy away from the magnet which will eventually wear down. It seems like the machine above may be using magnets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that machine also has pendulums. It is therefore possible that energy could be borrowed from the rotation of the earth, which would make free swinging pendulums rotate around (ala &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum"&gt;Foucault&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also heard of a clock that is wound by the expansion and contraction of various metals in the spring from the daily cycle of heating and cooling in the room. Watches that wind by the motion of the wearer are now old hat, but that is another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, there is lots of usable energy in the environment. If you could tap into some source of energy, even if it is slight, it can potentially keep a precise system going indefinitely (as long as the conditions and materials remain stable). On a large scale such systems may even be used to generate usable energy. I have heard plans for sidewalks that derive energy from the people walking on them, or piezoelectrical systems that generate electricity from the energy of raindrops falling on them. In the new era of supposed green energy, most people have probably seen proposals for generating energy from ocean waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fun to think about the ultimate sources of energy on the earth - mainly solar, nuclear and geothermal. The sun heats the surface of the earth putting a lot of energy into the system, which causes the wind to blow, runs waterfalls, and gives energy to plants (the ultimate source of all fossil fuel energy). Radioactive minerals provide energy through nuclear reactors. And the earth itself is very hot beneath the surface - energy deriving from all the collisions that formed the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another potential source of energy - the gravity of the moon and sun, which cause tides, which could be tapped for energy. There are also many sources of chemical energy, although I am not sure how much of that derives from other sources like solar and geothermal. And naturally occurring magnets have energy, but again I am not sure where they ultimately get their energy from - from the collisions that made them or from the supernova that formed the elements themselves (which is the ultimate source of nuclear energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have probably missed something. If you can think of any other ultimate sources of energy that we could potentially tap into, let us know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250423842081"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=15115">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b07b75fbc299e7bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Nampa Classical Academy Can’t Use the Bible</title><published>2009-08-16T11:00:49Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T11:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/16/nampa-classical-academy-cant-use-the-bible/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/13/nampa-classical-academy-to-teach-multiple-creation-myths-in-classes/"&gt;Nampa Classical Academy in Idaho&lt;/a&gt;?  The charter school that planned to use the Bible as the primary source for teaching material, and had conservative Christians serving in advisory capacities?  The school that was a lawsuit waiting to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Idaho Public Charter School Commission has told the school &lt;a href="http://www.ktvb.com/news/localnews/stories/ktvba-agu1509-bible_public_schools.e3128d15.html"&gt;not to use the Bible&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Nampa Classical Academy says it had planned to use the Bible and other religious texts as a primary source for instruction but not to teach religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Idaho Press-Tribune reported that the commission released a memo Friday saying the state Constitution “expressly” limits use of religious texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School board Chairman Kyle Borger says the school will follow the commission’s directive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a good first step, but Idaho residents should still keep a close eye on the brand new school.  Even if the Bible isn’t being used as history text, there’s still reason to believe these kids are being denied a proper education.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no sex ed, they teach an America-is-the-best! version of history, and they still are teaching “multiple creation myths” — something that hasn’t been fully explained.&lt;/p&gt;

How would you do it? Make him wear a fluorescent shirt and dye his hair (don’t do it in the middle of the crowd, I can’t guarantee your safety).Purdue University researchers have been successful in focusing at the cell of interest among a background of equally noisy and boisterous biomolecules and other metabolically active cells. Currently, researchers use immunological techniques to create an antibody to a molecule and then visualize the ‘molecule of interest’ by tagging the antibody to a radioisotope or a fluorescent dye; and flow cytometry can sort out different types of cells.The Purdue University team used gold coated nanoparticles with an iron oxide core that was impregnated in the cell they wished to see. They then subjected the specimen to a periodically changing magnetic field. The superparamagnetic cores (superparamagnetic nanoparticles have no net magnetization, but an external magnetic field can magnetize them) responded by rotating as the magnetic field rotated around them. The rotation could be seen in the ‘near infra-red’ light spectrum, as the incident light bounced off (scattered) the specially designed arms of the gold nanostar as it revolved. The rate (rpm) of this gyromagnetic (gyros means to rotate) twinkling could be externally controlled by varying the rate of the externally applied field. You now could identify the cell by its characteristic ‘twinkling’ (lighthouse type) effect.I am tempted to go beyond what’s been achieved so far. Here I go. I guess you are all familiar what happens to the rotating ceiling fan blades when you turn on a fluorescent lamp. Don’t you see a momentary snapshot of the three blades (some have 4)? That’s what where stroboscope comes in. It consists of a Xenon lamp (ordinary fluorescent lamps could do, but incandescent lamps won’t work as the glowing filament takes time to extinguish) flashing at a controllable rate. The electronic circuitry may be had here.Suppose that the fan is revolving at 1200 RPM and it is not changing. Set your stroboscope to flash at this rate. You’ll ‘see’ that the fan blades are absolutely not moving, which is certainly not true! But be there any mechanical defect in the fan, it will stand out as the centrifugal force widens it (provided that the fault is more or less tangential to the axis of rotation). Here also we are looking at our object of interest, aren’t we?Now lets look what implication it might have in biological imaging. We now know that the gamma subunit of mitochondrial F type ATP Synthase ‘actually’ rotates when it is synthesizing ATP (reverse rotation occurs when ATP is hydrolyzed). There are other locomotive units within the cell as well. They comprise of actin and myosin based molecular motors. Could we study them using an externally adjustable stroboscope? The optical (electromagnetic) signals so obtained may then be similarly broken down into simpler trigonometric (sine and cosine) functions by Fourier analysis (Fourier transform) as was done in the ‘twinkling nanostars’ experiment. At least, we expect to get rid of some &amp;#39;noise&amp;#39; and some good still photos. But if we wanted better resolution and used higher frequency (electromagnetic) for it, some extraneous error will be introduced. It&amp;#39;s a trade-off!Last modified: neverReference: hyper-links, unless specifically mentionedPrinciples of Biochemistry, Lehninger, 4th edhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_synthaseWei, Q., Song, H., Leonov, A., Hale, J., Oh, D., Ong, Q., Ritchie, K., &amp;amp; Wei, A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Partnering with Jenny McCarthy was a no-brainer for us,” said Tony Key, vice president of sales and marketing, North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truer words have never been spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="baby-with-middle-finger" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/baby-with-middle-finger.jpg?w=116&amp;amp;h=175" alt="baby-with-middle-finger" width="116" height="175"&gt;Next, the anti-vaccine and/or autism denial propaganda blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/08/first-michael-savage-then-denis-leary-now-rex-reed.html"&gt;Age of Autism is ironically attacking Rex Reed&lt;/a&gt; for his description of autism &lt;a href="http://www.observer.com/2009/movies/hugh-dancy-his-way-superstardom"&gt;in his review for the new film, &lt;em&gt;Adam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Wow! Pot. Kettle. Black. So what did Reed say that pissed off Age of Autism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 28th, film critic Rex Reed of The New York Observer wrote, “Asperger’s is an incurable neurological disorder similar to autism that turns outwardly normal-looking people into high-class idiot savants…They are incapable of thinking of anyone or anything outside of themselves,” and “It is lethal to get involved romantically with any person with Asperger’s syndrome, since they care nothing about other people’s feelings, needs or priorities. Almost without exception, they leave you perplexed, riddled with doubt and totally depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while I think Reed’s review is more than a little bit ignorant and insensitive to people on the autism spectrum, it’s clear to me that Reed is just not educated about autism/Aspergers. And that’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now  given that he wrote things that are factually untrue and clearly exposed his complete ignorance of the condition, I hope he does make some apologies in the future after inevitably receiving corrections. But I think Age of Autism is hardly one to talk as they’re far more deluded on the subject than Reed is. At least Reed recognizes that “Asperger’s is an incurable neurological disorder,” which puts him way ahead of AoA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I also feel like I have to seriously mock the opening paragraphs of this silly blog from Age of Autism by paralleling some of their unintentionally ironic statements about autism-denying celebrities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, some celebrity will make highly offensive comments about a group of people, and tick a few people off. In the case of autism spectrum disorders, two celebrities in the past year made such statements. The first was Jenny McCarthy, former Playboy bunny and MTV game show host already known for not being very bright, calling autism “vaccine injury,” “mercury poisoning” and saying that a person with autism can be “recovered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, history often has a habit of repeating itself. Jim Carrey, a comedian known for literally talking out of his own ass, started making slanderous, unsupported conspiracy claims in an article published in the Huffington Post soon after McCarthy’s published rants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the reputations of the previous two celebrities left primarily intact, it’s only be a matter of time before another public figure makes equally asinine remarks about ASD.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a whole lot of fun and went pretty well. We learned a lot, though. In no particular order:&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two hours is not nearly as long as you think it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting with a laundry list of fallacies will not go quickly, and it is not even really necessary, which was the rationale that kept it in even though we knew it would be boring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you don't practice it and go in with a first draft, it will be first drafty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you don't start early enough, you won't have time to practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;People like stories about dick-enlargement pills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;People find cargo cults incredibly interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two hours really isn't nearly as long as you think it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously on that last one. Being generous I'd guess we made it through about 50% of our prepared material. We wasted way too much time on the fallacies section, which is better done in context anyway. I mean, when you have to repeat what confirmation bias is when it comes up in a topic, you've just said it twice and wasted the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, it really is f'ing boring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We managed to cover advertising BS, alternative medicine, anti-vaccination (I was really proud of our work on that section), bigfoot, pareidolia, and a bit I wrote about how woo is always interpreted through a cultural filter (i.e. alien abductions didn't crop up as a regular claim until after Betty and Barney Hill, who injected the meme into the culture and gave people a way interpret their hypnagogia that they didn't have before).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterwards, we got a lot of positive feedback and made a few connections. Folks are looking forward to our presentations next year (more on that in a minute).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike Stackpole offered lots of good advice when we met with him Friday. Mostly we talked about what kinds of things would make a skeptical "track" at Gen Con viable, and even in just a bit less than an hour he gave us tons of great material. We're really excited about next year; we're going to trim and refine a 2-hour skeptical overview panel and do at least one specific topic panel, either something fun and interesting or something important that's big in the news next summer. I'll talk more about the future of Gen Con skepticism in the coming weeks and months when I have more time (and more develops).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have video of &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; of the panel. It was a jury-rigged setup (the whole damn thing was, really); we had to use a spare laptop with a webcam because we couldn't procure an actual video camera to record the talk. Partway through, the battery died, and I'm not sure how much we lost before I noticed it and we plugged the computer in and got it restarted. We got the rest of the panel, but the downside is that it was sitting on the table, so mostly what you see is a crappy view of our slideshow and a person standing around and talking about it. Really quite shitty. We'll try to do better next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, as soon as we can get that cut down, it'll go up on YouTube in little bite-sized chunks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow I'm taking off for a week-long road trip to Key West with a couple of old friends. I'll be away from the blog (and most technology that doesn't involve moving over or swimming under water), so I won't have a full Gen Con report up until at least a week from Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the moment, I'd just like to ask that any of you, my wonderful readers, who have ideas for Gen Con skepticism in 2010, or want to attend, or want to contribute or help out in any way, please leave me a comment here in this thread or e-mail me at o dot kakodaimon at gmail dot com. The more people we have working on this the better chance we have at lighting a skeptical candle at yet another major pop culture convention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-5007684972334095752?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250406901338"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=4033">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fadc8c83d0a8ab90</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Intelligent Design/Creationism"/><category term="Creation"/><category term="Kent Hovind"/><category term="Kevin Miller"/><category term="Resurrection Pictures"/><title type="html">More garbage from the writer of ‘Expelled’</title><published>2009-08-16T06:59:50Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T06:59:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/more-garbage-from-the-writer-of-expelled/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.durangobill.com/JGpics/JasonHovind.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.durangobill.com/JGpics/JasonHovind.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="220"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You might call it &lt;em&gt;Expelled 2&lt;/em&gt;, but the writer from last year’s Ben Stein mockumentary (yes, it turns out that when your documentary isn’t based on anything true, you need a screenwriter) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_next_big_thing_from_the_cr.php"&gt;has another film in the woodwork&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt;, Resurrection Pictures’ first original film project—a humorous and tearful story of a high school biology teacher’s struggle to expose the lie of evolution, based on the life of creation evangelist Dr. Kent Hovind and written by Kevin Miller the writer of &lt;em&gt;Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for production in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, goody! I love a good Science &lt;strong&gt;Fiction&lt;/strong&gt; flick. I wonder if they’ll include Hovind getting pounded in the ass in prison after committing tax evasion or the part &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQTgn06WslE"&gt;when Hovind tries to get his own daughter to hide evidence for him&lt;/a&gt;. But somehow I have a feeling that they’ll leave that part out. But perhaps more likely, their Hovind-like hero wll be treated in the film as some persecuted martyr ala Jesus. More likely? Who am I kidding? Of course that what the writer will do. Christians love playing the martyr.&lt;/p&gt;

But lately it seems to keep coming up in interviews with him,&lt;a href="http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/celebrity-gossip/2009/07/22/brad-pitt-interview/inglourious-basterd-star-on-angelina-jolie-and-six-kids.html"&gt; first in the German publication BILD&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/brad-pitts-mayoral-platfo_n_258351.html"&gt;the other day on the Today Show&lt;/a&gt;. And now he goes into a little more length about his views of religion appropriately enough on Bill Maher’s show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/brad-pitt-giving-the-term-a-list-celebrity-a-new-meaning/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/fIDeveRVTEI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s great that such a major celebrity is so open about his atheism and I’m glad that we got such a charitable and well liked celebrity to point too. I also hope Pitt and his partner Angelina Jolie, who’s also an atheist, continue to discuss some of the toxic effects of religion in the mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For awhile now I’ve been pushing for atheist groups to create advertisements that put a human face on atheism, both showing normal people who just happen to be atheists as well as beloved celebrities who just happen to be atheists. I’ve also mentioned to friends that I’d love to see someone borrow the tune of Adam Sandler’s famous “Chanukah Song” to create a song information people of all the many celebrity atheists. I’ve even worked on some of the lyrics. I think this type of campaign should be the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, Tom Chick (who, I'm told but don't know for sure, is actually Jack Chick's son) &lt;a href="http://fidgit.com/archives/2009/08/ubisoft_reveals_fitness_game_f.php"&gt;warns us about a new Wii game&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.ubi.com"&gt;Ubisoft&lt;/a&gt;  called &lt;a href="http://yourshapegame.us.ubi.com"&gt;Your Shape&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds as though it's nothing more than another of "personalized" exercise guides, but what it does have that other such exercise guides lack is a certifiably loony anti-vaccine wingnut as one of its "health experts." Indeed, as Tom points out, this is what Ubisoft says in &lt;a href="http://videogames.yahoo.com/news-1343297"&gt;its press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to being the face of Your Shape featuring Jenny McCarthy in North America, Jenny will also be your in-game work-out buddy, providing a fun and motivating exercise experience, while also ensuring that players get the most efficient, and effective, work-out possible. Once the player completes an initial fitness test, McCarthy's in-game avatar will be able to completely personalize their workout routine to both their fitness level as well as their personal fitness goals. And, with the innovative new motion tracking technology, the game is able to follow a player's movements as they work-out, and guides them so that they know whether or not they're doing the exercises correctly.

&lt;p&gt;"Partnering with Jenny McCarthy was a no-brainer for us," said Tony Key, vice president of sales and marketing, North America. "Her commitment to fitness, and exceptionally wide fan-base, make her an ideal fit for the Your Shape brand. Best of all, she will make the workout fun for players, which is an element that has been missing in the fitness game market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/tom_son_of_jack_chick_gives_a_heads_up_u.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/tom_son_of_jack_chick_gives_a_heads_up_u.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/xEIDvmHnh8o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250388894876"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/08/15/where-am-i-science-tattoo/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e291e5055ca7a209</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Tattoo Emporium"/><title type="html">Where Am I?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yesterday, I got my first science tattoo — and first tattoo period — taking inspiration from you and the lovely people in the Science Tattoo Emporium.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mine is a hippocampal neuron: specifically, a pyramidal cell found in area CA1. It’s been implicated in spatial memory, which is something my lab works on. (In rodent EEG, hippocampal “place response” has been seen in this type of neuron.)  But more than that, I find it to be one of those classically beautiful images in science.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for the inspiration and encouragement. Science nerd pride!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A run-down of good recent stuff, highly recommended for your weekend reading and bookmarking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/mfenner/blog/2009/08/15/plos-one-interview-with-peter-binfield" title=""&gt;PLoS One: Interview with Peter Binfield&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...In my view PLoS ONE is the most dynamic, innovative and exciting journal in the world, and I am proud to work on it.

&lt;p&gt;In many ways PLoS ONE operates like any other journal however it diverges in several important respects. The founding principle of PLoS ONE was that there are certain aspects of publishing which are best conducted pre-publication and certain aspects which are best conducted post-publication. The advent of online publishing has allowed us to take a step back and re-evaluate these aspects of how we publish research, without the burden of centuries of tradition. In this way, we have been able to experiment with new ways of doing things which may result in dramatic improvements in the entire process of scholarly publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing which has come out of this premise is that unlike almost every other journal in the world, we make no judgment call whatsoever on the 'impact' or 'significance' or 'interest level' of any submission. What this means is that if an article appropriately reports on well-conducted science, and if it passes our peer review process (which determines whether it deserves to join the scientific literature) then we will publish it. In this way, no author should ever receive the message that their article is scientifically sound but 'not interesting enough' for our journal, or that their article is 'only suited to a specialized audience'. As a result, we short circuit the vicious cycle of "submit to a 'top tier' journal; get reviewed; get rejected; submit to the next journal down the list; repeat until accepted" and we are therefore able to place good science into the public domain as promptly as possible, with the minimum of burden on the academic community....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://shirleywho.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/the-evolution-of-scientific-impact/" title=""&gt;The evolution of scientific impact&lt;/a&gt; (also a good &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/shwu/ecc6e936/evolution-of-scientific-impact" title=""&gt;FriendFeed thread&lt;/a&gt; about it):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is clear to me is this - science and society are much richer and more interconnected now than at any time in history. There are many more people contributing to science in many more ways now than ever before. Science is becoming more broad (we know about more things) and more deep (we know more about these things). At the same time, print publishing is fading, content is exploding, and technology makes it possible to present, share, and analyze information faster and more powerfully.

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I believe (as many others do) that the traditional model of peer-reviewed journals should and will necessarily change significantly over the next decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=407705" title=""&gt;A threat to scientific communication&lt;/a&gt; (read excellent responses by &lt;a href="http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2214" title=""&gt;Peter Murray-Rast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/news.php?item.540.11" title=""&gt;Bjoern Brembs&lt;/a&gt; and a thread on &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/petermr/99dcc9fd/article-do-academic-journals-pose-threat-to" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sulston argues that the use of journal metrics is not only a flimsy guarantee of the best work (his prize-winning discovery was never published in a top journal), but he also believes that the system puts pressure on scientists to act in ways that adversely affect science - from claiming work is more novel than it actually is to over-hyping, over-interpreting and prematurely publishing it, splitting publications to get more credits and, in extreme situations, even committing fraud.

&lt;p&gt;The system also creates what he characterises as an "inefficient treadmill" of resubmissions to the journal hierarchy. The whole process ropes in many more reviewers than necessary, reduces the time available for research, places a heavier burden on peer review and delays the communication of important results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/comment-n537.html" title=""&gt;Why do we still publish scientific papers?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I agree with the need to filter papers, but I want to be in control of the filter. I don't want editors to control my filter and I definitely don't want a monopolist like Thomson to muck up my filter. I don't care where something is published, if it's in my direct field I need to read it, no matter how bad it is. If a paper is in my broader field, I'd apply some light filtering, such as rating, comments, downloads, author institute, social bookmarks, or some such. If the paper is in a related field, I'd like to only read reviews of recent advances. If it's in an unrelated field, but one I'm interested in nonetheless, I'd only want to see the news-and-views article, because I wouldn't understand anything else anyway. For everything else, titles, headlines or newsreports are good enough for browsing. All of this can be done after publishing and certainly doesn't require any artificial grouping by pseudo-tags (formerly called journals).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://moregrumbinescience.blogspot.com/2009/08/science-jabberwocky.html" title=""&gt;Science Jabberwocky&lt;/a&gt; (how to read/understand a scientific paper when you don't know the technical terms):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have to confess that in areas outside mine, there seems to be a terrible array of words no more obvious than 'brillig' and 'slithy'. And words that look familiar, like 'gyre and gimble', but which don't look like they are supposed to mean what I'm used to them meaning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/media-tracking/" title=""&gt;Media tracking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theropod behaviour paper that I have been boring you all with this last week or so has been the first time I have had decent control over the media access to my work and by extension the first time I have had a good idea of what happened to the original press release. I know what I sent to whom and when and thus can fairly easily track what happened afterwards to record the spread and exchange of information from that origin. In the past on the Musings I have targeted inaccuracies in news reports of scientific stories but without knowing the exact details of a story (I may have access to the press release but without knowing who it went to). Well, not so this time and as a result the pattern of reporting I can see is both interesting and informative both from understanding how the media works and knowing how to get your own work publicised.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://svenssonresearchlaboratory.blogspot.com/2009/08/rapid-evolution-of-rodents-another-plos.html" title=""&gt;Rapid evolution of rodents: another PLoS ONE study in the media&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although media attention and coverage is not, and should certainly not be, the only criterion for scientific "quality" (whatever that is!), it is further testimony of the advantage to publish in "Open Acess"-journals in general, and PLoS ONE in particular. This study is also interesting because it shows the value of museum collections as a source for ecological and evolutionary research, a point that Shawn Kuchta has repeatedly emphasized in our lab-meetings (and which I completely agree with, of course).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. Open Access Journals (Opener #5): The publishing world is increasing becoming open access. Open access journals in the healthcare area provide invaluable information to those in the developing world. The Public Library of Science (PLoS) offers free peer-reviewed scientific journals. Scientists who publish in PLoS journals might present their work in SciVee. SciVee allows the user to hear or see the scientist explain his or her research in what is known as pubcasts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been using blogs in my teaching for several years now, so I wanted to share a few ideas that have worked for me. I'm no expert and I'm still casting about for solutions to some of the more nagging problems, but after thirteen course blogs spread across seven semesters (I just counted!), I have obtained a small measure of experience. In other words, I keep making mistakes, but at least not the same ones over and over.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/7/649?ijkey=Tarf0DE9052G" title=""&gt;Practicing Medicine in the Age of Facebook&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my second week of medical internship, I received a "friend request" on Facebook, the popular social-networking Web site. The name of the requester was familiar: Erica Baxter. Three years earlier, as a medical student, I had participated in the delivery of Ms. Baxter's baby. Now, apparently, she wanted to be back in touch.....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are young people of today &lt;a href="http://teachmechem.edublogs.org/2009/08/10/relationally-starved/" title=""&gt;Relationally Starved&lt;/a&gt;?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The more I toss it around, I'm not so sure that our students are "relationally starved."  I just think that relationships look much different today than they have in generations past.  Their relationships are more fluid and maybe a little more fragile.  It is obvious that advances in technology have changed the way relationships are built and maintained (it has for me).  This doesn't mean that children aren't in need of the same nurturing and love that we might have had, but there are other layers that we need to ask them about.  And I think that might be the key, ASK THEM!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2009/07/new-yorker-vs-kindle.html" title=""&gt;The New Yorker vs. the Kindle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, let's imagine for a moment that we are back in the 15th century, to be precise just shortly after 1439, when Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg invented movable type printing. I can only imagine the complaints that Baker would have uttered in the local paper (which was, of course, copied by hand from the original dictation). What? Only one title on the catalog? (The Bible.) Oh, and the fonts are sooo boring compared to handwriting. And no colors! And the quality of the drawings, simply unacceptable. This movable type printing thing will never ever replace the amanuenses, it will simply die as yet another "modern invention" and things will keep being just the same as they have been throughout what they at the time didn't yet call the Middle Ages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cogscilibrarian.blogspot.com/2009/07/new-yorker-news-biz.html" title=""&gt;The New Yorker &amp;amp; The News Biz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After many years, I am finally subscribing to the New Yorker again. Not in print, but via their Digital Reader. I'm blogging about it because I like their model: the Digital Reader adds something I wouldn't get from the library version, and I feel like this new model bears watching as we migrate from print to online.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://booksandculture.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/the-psychology-of-reading-for-pleasure/" title=""&gt;The psychology of reading for pleasure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to a neurological study that Nell performed, processing demands are higher with books than other media (movies, television) but that also means that when you are absorbed in a book, you are more likely to block out distractions. While readers describe being absorbed in a book as "effortless," their brains are actually intensely active. As one critic said, this is not an escape from thinking, it's an escape into thinking - intensely, and without distraction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html" title=""&gt;How Twitter works in theory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The key to Twitter is that it is phatic - full of social gestures that are like apes grooming each other. Both Google and Twitter have little boxes for you to type into, but on Google you're looking for information, and expecting a machine response, whereas on Twitter you're declaring an emotion and expecting a human response. This is what leads to unintentionally ironic newspaper columns bemoaning public banality, because they miss that while you don't care what random strangers feel about their lunch, you do if its your friend on holiday in Pompeii.

&lt;p&gt;--------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with Habermas's assumption of a single common public sphere this makes no sense - surely everyone should see everything that anyone says as part of the discussion? In fact this has never made sense, and in the past elaborate systems have been set up to ensure that only a few can speak, and only one person can speak at a time, because a speech-like, real-time discourse has been the foundational assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often this worldview has been built into the default assumptions of communications online; we see it now with privileged speakers decrying the use of anonymity in the same tones as 19th century politicians defended hustings in rotten boroughs instead of secret ballots. Thus the tactics of shouting down debate in town halls show up as the baiting and trollery that make YouTube comments a byword for idiocy; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/4x5pm50v03628453/fulltext.pdf" title=""&gt;Blogging Evolution (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I describe the general characteristics of blogs, contrasting blogs with other of WWW formats for self-publishing. I describe four categories for blogs about evolutionary biology: "professional," "amateur," "apostolic," and "imaginative." I also discuss blog networks. I identify paradigms of each category. Throughout, I aim to illuminate blogs about evolutionary biology from the point of view of a
user looking for information about the topic. I conclude that blogs are not the best type of source for systematic and authoritative information about evolution, and that they are best used by the information-seeker as a way of identifying what issues are of interest in the community of evolutionists and for generating research leads or fresh insights on one's own work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Steven Krantz asked me to write an opinion piece about math blogging in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society.  I asked if I could talk about this column on my blog, and even have people comment on drafts of it before it comes out in the Notices.  He said okay. So, just to get the ball rolling, let me ask: what do you think mathematicians need to know about blogging?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/five-key-reasons-why-newspapers-are-failing" title=""&gt;Five Key Reasons Why Newspapers Are Failing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/five-key-reasons-why-newspapers-are-failing-pt-2" title=""&gt;Five Key Reasons Why Newspapers Are Failing, pt. 2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Journalists are pretty good at working the scene of a disaster. They'll tell you what happened, who did it, and why.

&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to the disaster engulfing their own profession, their analysis is less rigorous. An uncharacteristic haze characterizes a lot of the reporting and commentary on the current crisis of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could have been brought on by delicacy, perhaps romanticism. And since it is not just any crisis, but a definitive one--one that seems to mean an end to the physical papers' role in American life as we have come to know it--perhaps there's a little bit of shell-shock in the mix as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amysampleward.org/2009/08/06/online-community-building-gardening-vs-landscaping/" title=""&gt;Online Community Building: Gardening vs Landscaping&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Gardener creates an ecosystem open to change, available to new groups, and full of fresh opportunities to emerge naturally.  The approach is focused on organic collaboration and growth for the entire community.  The gardener is simply there to help, cultivate, and clear the weeds if/when they poke up.

&lt;p&gt;The Landscaper creates an ecosystem that matches a preconceived design or pattern.  The approach is focused on executing a preconceived environment, regardless of how natural or organic it may be for the larger area.  The landscaper is there to ensure that everything stays just as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/dont_be_such_a_scientist_talki.php" title=""&gt;Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style&lt;/a&gt; (book review):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;So I end up feeling a bit torn. He's telling us "Don't be such a scientist", and it's true that there are many occasions when the scientific attitude can generate unnecessary obstacles to accomplishing our goals. At the same time, though, I want to say "Do be such a scientist", because it's part of our identity and it makes us stand out as unusual and, like Randy, interesting, even if it sometimes does make us a bit abrasive. But, you know, some of us revel in our abrasiveness; it's fun.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has also been in the news a lot last week:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent posts on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/the_shock_value_of_science_blo.php" title=""&gt;the topic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/04/scienceonline09_-_saturday_430.php" title=""&gt;dear to&lt;/a&gt; my heart - the so-called "civility" in public (including online) discourse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2009/08/how_creationism_and_other_idio.php" title=""&gt;How Creationism (and Other Idiocies) Are Mainstreamed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the things that has enabled the mainstreaming of various idiocies, from altie woo, to creationism, to global warming denialism is mainstream corporate media's inability to accurately describe lunacy. For obvious reasons, 'family-friendly' newspapers and teevee can't call creationists, birthers, or deathers batshit lunatic or fucking morons. This is where 'civility' (beyond the basic norms of decency when dealing with the mentally ill) and pretensions of 'balance' utterly fail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/weekend_diversion_how_to_argue.php" title=""&gt;Weekend Diversion: How to Argue&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You are, of course, free to argue however you like. But if you want to argue on my site, you're really best off remembering this hierarchy, and staying as high as possible on it. Most of you do pretty well, but this has served me well in general, and I hope it helps you to see things laid out like this. And if not, at least you got a great song out of it!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/when_an_image_makes_an_argumen.php" title=""&gt;When an image makes an argument&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Along similar lines to a frequentist interpretation of the strata, maybe this pyramid is conveying something about the ease or difficulty inherent in different types of engagement. It doesn't take a lot of effort to call someone an asshat, but understanding her argument well enough to raise a good counterexample to it may take some mental labor. If this is the rhetorical work that the pyramidal layout does here, it may also suggest a corresponding hierarchy of people who have the mental skills to engage in each of these ways -- making the people at the tippy-top of the pyramid more elite than those using the strategies from lower strata.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/how_to_argue.php" title=""&gt;How to Argue...&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;White men are sufficiently privileged enough to demand that they be treated respectfully while white women, at best, can expect to be presented with contradiction and counterargument.  When I saw the category "responding to tone" I thought of the "angry black man" who, although perhaps right, is castigated for his anger and lack of civility for not conforming to the norms of white society.  If you're a non-white woman?  Then, the best you can do is hope to not be denied food and shelter if you don't fuck your husband enough (h/t to Free-Ride for pointing this article out), but you only expect to be part of the discussion if you're allowed to be.

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call to civility is a frequent tactic to derail the discussion and is as much of an ad hominem attack as calling someone a cocknozzle.  It fails to recognize the perspective of the other party or appreciate why they might be angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on the topic: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am lucky to have such thoughtful commenters. When I wrote the previous post I had no idea that bleeding from my vagina was clouding my judgement. Then, just when I thought I had cleared enough of the estrogen from my girl brain to understand, I learned that this was all a carefully planned tactic to teach me a lesson. Damn! I hate when that happens!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/08/weekend_diversion_how_to_argue.php" title=""&gt;Weekend Diversion: How to argue...and actually accomplish something&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here we arrive at the meat of the matter. Once having accomplished more than about 300 ms worth of consideration of a given topic, people are highly resistant to the idea that their rationale, conclusions and evidence base might actually be wrong. And the wronger the consideration might be, the more resistant to acknowledgment is the individual. We might think of this as the intrapersonal Overton window. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.buzzflash.com/node/9213" title=""&gt;A Tale of Two Nations: the Civil War may have been won by the North, but in truth the South never emotionally conceded.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Civil War may have been won by the North, but in truth the South never emotionally conceded.

&lt;p&gt;The Town Hall mobs, the birthers, the teabaggers are all part of that long line of "coded" agitators for the notions of white entitlement and "conservative values."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this conservative viewpoint values cheap labor and unabated use of natural resources over technological and economic innovation.  It also - and this is its hot molten core - fundamentally believes that white people are born with a divine advantage over people of other skin colors, and are chosen by God to lead the heathen hordes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That a Town Hall mob is itself a heathen horde would never occur to the economically stressed whites who listen to the lies of the likes of Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Lou Dobbs. Lies that confirm an emotionally reinforcing worldview - however heinous - become truths for those in psychological need of feeling superior and chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://margaretandhelen.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/i-remember-an-america-where-black-men-didn/" title=""&gt;I remember an America where black men didn't grow up to be President.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And all of them are asking for their America back.  I wonder which America that would be?

&lt;p&gt;Would that be the America where the Supreme Court picks your president instead of counting all the votes?  Would that be the America where rights to privacy are ignored?  Would that be the America where the Vice President shoots his best friend in the face?  Or would that be the America where an idiot from Alaska and a college drop-out with a radio show could become the torchbearers for the now illiterate Republican party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that would not be the America they want back.  I fear that the America they want back is the one where black men don't become President.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that America.  In that America people screaming at public gatherings were called out for what they were - an angry mob.   Of course, they wore sheets to cover up their bad hair.  Let's be clear about something:  if you show up to a town hall meeting with a gun strapped to your leg, the point you are trying to make isn't a good one.  Fear never produced anything worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/14/AR2009081401495.html?sid=ST2009081402964" title=""&gt;In America, Crazy Is a Preexisting Condition&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tree of crazy is an ever-present aspect of America's flora. Only now, it's being watered by misguided he-said-she-said reporting and taking over the forest. Latest word is that the enlightened and mild provision in the draft legislation to help elderly people who want living wills -- the one hysterics turned into the "death panel" canard -- is losing favor, according to the Wall Street Journal, because of "complaints over the provision." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two oldies but goodies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2007/10/atheists-and-an.html" title=""&gt;Atheists and Anger&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the most common criticisms lobbed at the newly-vocal atheist community is, "Why do you have to be so angry?" So I want to talk about:

&lt;p&gt;1. Why atheists are angry;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Why our anger is valid, valuable, and necessary;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 3. Why it's completely fucked-up to try to take our anger away from us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2007/10/atheists-and--1.html" title=""&gt;Atheists and Anger: A Reply to the Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now my replies to the critics. I suppose I shouldn't bother, I suppose I should just let it go and focus on the love. But I seem to be constitutionally incapable of letting unfair or inaccurate accusations just slide. So here are my replies to some of the critical comments' common themes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theangryblackwoman.com/2008/02/12/the-privilege-of-politeness/" title=""&gt;The Privilege of Politeness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One item that comes up over and over in discussions of racism is that of tone/attitude. People of Color (POC) are very often called on their tone when they bring up racism, the idea being that if POC were just more polite about the whole thing the offending person would have listened and apologized right away. This not only derails the discussion but also tries to turn the insults/race issues into the fault of POC and their tone. Many POC have come to the realization that the expectation of politeness when saying something insulting is a form of privilege. At the core of this expectation of politeness is the idea that the POC in question should teach the offender what was wrong with their statement. Because in my experience what is meant by "be polite" is "teach me", teach me why you're offended by this, teach me how to be racially sensitive and the bottom line is that it is no one's responsibility to teach anyone else. And even when POC are as polite as possible there is still hostility read into the words because people are so afraid of being called racist that they would rather go on offending than deal with the hard road of confronting their own prejudices. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/praxis_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/DNi7X7IPWTk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250382537473"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_next_big_thing_from_the_cr.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf00acf3d1f1c58b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">The next big thing from the creationist movie community</title><published>2009-08-16T00:17:44Z</published><updated>2009-08-16T00:17:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pSRc_PlSET0/the_next_big_thing_from_the_cr.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_next_big_thing_from_the_cr.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kevin Miller, screenwriter for the propaganda film &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has a &lt;a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/172094"&gt;new project in the works that follows in the Christian movie tradition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The two second-session Language Loggers, Adam Albright and I, were in complementary distribution with the two first-session Language Loggers, Geoffs Nunberg and Pullum: we did not meet in Berkeley.  Not all of us have finished our work for our classes — I still have 15 of my 42 papers to grade — but our tight-knit community — living in the same dorm, sorry, residential unit (palatial by my loooong-ago student-era standards) and eating at the same university dining hall (spectacular by my ditto standards) —  is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great Institute!  I learned any  number of cool things, partly from my own students (who hailed from places as distant as Florida, Boston, Singapore, France, Poland, and Taiwan), partly from the two classes I sat in on, Adam Albright&amp;#39;s morphological change class and Emmon Bach &amp;amp; Pat Shaw&amp;#39;s class on Wakashan Linguistics, and partly from fellow faculty members.  From my students I learned, for instance, about Singapore&amp;#39;s  Speak Good English Movement (launched in 2000 and based on the earlier Speak Mandarin Campaign, vintage 1979, which was designed to encourage Chinese speakers to abandon other Chinese &amp;quot;dialects&amp;quot; and switch to Mandarin).  The SGEM is supposed to promote Standard Singapore English and demote &amp;quot;Singlish&amp;quot;, a.k.a. Singapore Colloquial English.   I also learned about Bhindi,  a mixture of Hindi and Marathi and maybe Dravidian languages as well, spoken in Bombay/Mumbai.   And the students raised the question of whether the Nicaraguan Sign Language is best seen as a pidgin, or a creole, or something else.  (I argued for abrupt creole status, on the grounds that the Deaf kids who created it brought their home-sign systems to the school where the NSL developed, and presumably contributed material from those sign systems to the emerging creole.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mark Donohue, who was teaching Phonological Typology of Papuan Languages in the second session, I learned a whole bunch of  fascinating things: about the Doutai speakers (NW New Guinea) who suppressed their language&amp;#39;s implosive consonants for several weeks while Mark was studying their language  (a phenomenon reminiscent of Dan Everett&amp;#39;s experience of living three years among the Pirahas in the Amazon before they stopped suppressing their linguo-labial stops in talking to him); about plugging in typological features — word order, consonant types, etc., etc., etc. — to biologists&amp;#39; statistical models and coming up with areal rather than genetic groupings in known cases (e.g., Rumanian grouped with Slavic rather than with the rest of the Romance languages); and about a wide range of other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s lots more, but you&amp;#39;ll have to attend an LSA Linguistic Institute yourself — say, in Boulder, Colorado, in 2011 — to get your own collection of exciting linguistic facts, perspectives, new theories.  No matter how old or young you are in age and/or in the field of linguistics, there&amp;#39;s something at an Institute for you.  About half the students in my language contact class at this Institute were undergraduates, for instance, and a few of them were studying at almost linguistics-free colleges.   Neophytes, in other words.  And they did just fine.   For language-lovers, it doesn&amp;#39;t get much better than a Linguistic Institute.   And that&amp;#39;s even aside from the occasional perks, like the view of the Golden Gate Bridge from my dorm window.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sally Thomason</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250377132201"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/keep_up_with_carnivals_and_nat.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00329f6e95278a00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Keep Up with Carnivals, and Nature Blogging Business</title><published>2009-08-15T23:38:07Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T23:38:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/xlfseGPgrYY/keep_up_with_carnivals_and_nat.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/keep_up_with_carnivals_and_nat.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a lot of web carnivals lately, and you may wonder why.  The reason:  No reason.  It just worked out that way.  But none of that matters... what I really want to tell you is about Nate's regular posting on the Nature Blog Network in which he lists all the upcoming deadlines for nature and many science carnivals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not already, &lt;a href="http://natureblognetwork.com/blog/carny-deadlines-august-11-2009/"&gt;you should be checking the Nature Blog Network on a regular basis, perhaps through their RSS feed. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are a Nature Blog Networks blogger, you should be aware of the coming purge.  &lt;a href="http://natureblognetwork.com/blog/a-most-mundane-post/"&gt;The NBN team writes about it here. &lt;/a&gt;  This is basically a cleanup operation.

He has for sometime been critical of the NHS model of health provision and recently appeared on US television and explained why. The background to this is that the US are themselves in the midst of a political controversy about reforming their own provision (or lack of provision) of health services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/FiSPRkq28iU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can here declare two interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, I am fond of the NHS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no illusions about it. In many ways it is a racket: an expensive and inefficient mix of pharma profiteering, PFI profiteering, sloppy procurement, self-interested professionals, incompetent management, Luddite public sector unions, and woeful IT development. All this masked by the soppy but powerful sentimentality of the NHS brand, making it almost impossible for any politician to promote genuine reform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that said, however, the NHS does ensure treatment free at the point of use for the poorest in our society. Any other model seems to risk greater social exclusion. For me this is the most important test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, in my view, placing public health provision on to an insurance policy basis does not remove the current complicated racket, but merely adds grasping insurance companies to the mix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, I could be wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may well be that there is actually a better model of health provision, including for the poor, than the NHS. It may even be that the NHS should be dismantled rather than reformed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I rather doubt it, but it is an important debate, and one which should not really be closed down too readily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And here I can declare a second interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was at university with Daniel Hannan and knew him slightly. And although I have not spoken with him for some fifteen or so years, I have followed his political career with interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is a rare political creature; not only is he sincere, his actions are actually connected to his stated beliefs. Moreover he has an independent mind, stocked with international comparisons and contrasts on many matters, not just health provision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not agree with his views on many issues (now less than ever given my drift to the left), but it is always worth listening to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it is useful to read what he has actually written on the subject, rather than creating a straw mman, for example &lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100006578/the-nhs-row-my-final-word/"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If he is right, and that other countries' models do have better public health outcomes, then this is an important contribution to the debate about health provision. And, if he is wrong, then this should be clearly set out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the wrong approach to his critique of the UK model of health care provision is, in my view, to rely on sentimentality of the &lt;em&gt;#welovethenhs&lt;/em&gt; campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not only discredited CAM practitioners with their misconceived legal claims that can effectively limit important debates on public health.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-5451406011314962345?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250375809915"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/ustream_tonight_with_extra_spe.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/869d3021a0c3765e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">UStream Tonight With Extra Special Guest Dr. Free-Ride</title><published>2009-08-15T22:31:33Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T22:31:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/v9Ilf9DF4xI/ustream_tonight_with_extra_spe.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/ustream_tonight_with_extra_spe.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Isis will UStream tonight about today's blog topic and other hilarity with extra special guest Dr. Free-Ride beginning at 10pm Eastern/7pm Pacific time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan of &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/startswithabang"&gt;Starts with a Bang&lt;/a&gt; has written a post on "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/?utm_source=bloglist&amp;amp;utm_medium=dropdown"&gt;How to Argue&lt;/a&gt;" as a guide for the people who engage in blog disagreements. I find Ethan's post derailing and counterproductive at best, offensive and naive at worst. Ethan seems to subscribe &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/?utm_source=bloglist&amp;amp;utm_medium=dropdown"&gt;to a particular school&lt;/a&gt; that believes that properly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/framing-science/about.php"&gt;framing the argument&lt;/a&gt; is crucial to its conduct and its productivity.  In his post Ethan contends that most arguments are &amp;quot;tough to decipher&amp;quot; because more people &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t argue clearly and logically.&amp;quot;  He tells us that name-calling or ad hominem comments never have a place in the dialogue, provides us some &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/when_an_image_makes_an_argumen.php"&gt;non-descript&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_how_to_argue/disagreement-hierarchy.jpg"&gt;hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; as guidance, and offers us the following rules for engagement on his blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are, of course, free to argue however you like. But if you want to argue &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;on my site, you're really best off remembering this hierarchy, and staying as high as possible on it. Most of you do pretty well, but this has served me well in general, and I hope it helps you to see things laid out like this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God bless Ethan for educating us all!&lt;/p&gt;Unfortunately, the privilege in this post reeks so badly it made my eyes water.  Allow me to illustrate:&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/how_to_argue.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/how_to_argue.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/IzNT05ToID4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250374487714"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=5873">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64dba723fec0eb12</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Autism Organizations"/><category term="College"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Intelligence"/><category term="adult students"/><category term="certificate program"/><category term="ernst vanbergeijk"/><category term="learning disabilites"/><category term="matthew schure"/><category term="nyit"/><category term="vip"/><title type="html">College Training (Part I)</title><published>2009-08-15T21:47:40Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T21:47:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/college-training-part-i/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Q.-and A. with Ernst VanBergeijk, associate dean and executive director of the New York Institute of Technology’s Vocational Independence Program (VIP), a certificate program for adult students with learning disabilities .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How did VIP begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: In 1987, NYIT President Matthew Schure realized that individuals with physical and learning disabilities were not offered the same access to opportunity as their non-disabled peers. Meanwhile, Neal Nelson, a local football coach and originator of the Weight Watchers children’s camps, and two colleagues approached President Schure with the idea of a summer program for teens with disabilities. The group began writing a curriculum for the summer program. By the time they were finished with the task, not only had they created a seven-week summer program for students with learning disabilities, but they formulated the basis for VIP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:548px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/enhance.jpg" alt="Image: NYIT VIP" width="538" height="124"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: NYIT VIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What’s the toughest thing about running the program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB: Understanding the reality. Individuals with disabilities face a 65% unemployment rate; for those on the autism spectrum, the rate is closer to 90%. Without comprehensive services the future is not promising. The hardest part of the job is getting the word out about the program, and knowing that not everyone who needs a program like ours can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, October 17, we’re having an open house at the Vocational Independence Program. The event will be held at Independence Hall on our Central Islip campus. The street address is 300 Carleton Avenue, Central Islip, N.Y. (reservations, 631-348-3139).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why do you think adulthood autism hasn’t received the attention that childhood autism has?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVB:It was an important strategy to develop awareness of autism first. Children are a vulnerable population that most politicians and the public cannot say no to and want to protect. Fortunately, now most Americans know 1 out of every 150 children has an autism spectrum disorder. It’s also fantastic that the focus was on early identification of and intervention with children on the spectrum. With empirically supported interventions we now have a generation of young people on the spectrum who, along with their families, can hope and dream about going to post secondary programs. Now, colleges and other post secondary programs need to prepare for this wave of able individuals on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think adult autism didn’t receive the attention because people used to think every one on the spectrum was like Dustin Hoffman’s character in &lt;em&gt;Rainman&lt;/em&gt;. They didn’t believe there was a range of abilities; everyone who had autism needed to be institutionalized, and that ended the story. We know this isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;

The Republicans, like those after whom they name themselves, would be happy with a fiddle plaing Caesar.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/michele_bachmann_will_hold_hea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/PPGxcMZTFCU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250371497845"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8860">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/197aa5ad9c68e8f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="atheist"/><category term="brad pitt"/><category term="maher"/><title type="html">Brad Pitt to Religious Zealots: Stop the Nonsense</title><published>2009-08-15T20:33:50Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T20:33:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8860" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5338176/brad-pitts-perfect-joint-rolling-strategy-political-positioning"&gt;Gawker&lt;/a&gt;, Brad Pitt goes on Bill Maher’s show and says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the three who are watching, I just say you have to, you really have to check what country you’re living in because the freedom that allows you to practice religion is the same freedom you’re stepping on. That’s not right….And I want to add… if there was a nation of gay married couples that were telling you you couldn’t practice your religion, I’d be speaking up for you, too…. So, let’s stop the nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At least, that is, the actual real world around us.  That’s the great insight we’ve achieved over the course of centuries of scientific investigation into the universe.  It all follows rules; everything has an explanation (which is not the same as everything having a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/11/27/things-happen-not-always-for-a-reason/"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was struck by &lt;a href="http://johnaugust.com/archives/2009/groundhog"&gt;this blog post by screenwriter John August&lt;/a&gt;.  He talks about the movie &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;, in which Bill Murray’s weatherman character is stuck in a time loop of unspecified duration.  For a film that seemed fairly inconsequential at the time, it’s really a great starting point for all sorts of conversations — I use it in &lt;a href="http://eternitytohere.com/"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; to talk a bit about time-travel paradoxes.  (Did I mention I’m writing a book?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But August uses it to illustrate the cinematic usefulness of unexplained magic.  Even in a fictional universe, you don’t want it to be &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; magical — there need to be &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/12/26/the-physics-of-imaginary-things/"&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise it’s impossible to have a coherent drama in which the characters struggle to achieve some goal.  In &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;, the goal is to win the love of Andie MacDowell, although different stories make different choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the central conceit of the movie — Bill Murray is stuck in an endless loop, trying to get out — remains completely unexplained.  In an early version of the script, apparently, there was some talk of a voodoo spell that set the time loop in motion.  Removing that bit of explanation was an incredibly smart decision.  If it had been included, the focus on the story of the protagonist’s journey would necessarily have been diluted by the attention paid to the voodoo spell.  The movie worked much better with that little bit of magic remaining unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can just imagine if Murray’s character had been a physicist instead of a TV personality.  Forget about winning someone’s love; the guy would have spent millions of years trying to figure out the mechanism behind his travel in a time loop.  It’s great when &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/18/seex/"&gt;scientists talk to Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, but thank goodness they haven’t taken over.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250368943355"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-7951481754617388658">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a85cc6214771e12</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="space flight" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">&amp;quot;You came in that thing?

&lt;p&gt;Connie Sonne sent me pictures supposedly taken by her of the missing British child, Maddie Mccann. She is sticking to her story that “all will be revealed” in some form on her website in September, including all her “evidence” accusing Banachek and the entire JREF team of “cheating and lying.” Personally, I can’t see that there’s any reason to think that these photos are anywhere near looking like the tot shown in the other collaged shots, even if she had grown up a few years. But who am I? I’m not psychic, so what do I know?&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Macann1" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Macann1.jpg" alt="Macann1" width="221" height="166"&gt;To me, these shots look suspiciously like bad scrapbook attempts and I for one would have opted for a more close-up CIA style blow-up if I was out to Photoshop some kind of mock-evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Connie is into psychic stuff and providing clear evidence (or even clear writing style) is not one of her talents. She’s a dowser, not a secret agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her interview that I conducted after her failed Million Dollar afternoon, she kept to her story of high government corruption and Maddie’s part in some global conspiracy having to do with vast amounts of secret money and everything shy of a Bilderberger profecy. Her note (spelling and English un-corrected for accuracy) attached to these photos reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mark Edward, I think you should know.-……. here is Madeleine Mccann, the british missing girl, on a plain for Southamerica last year, and you are welcome to publish it on your site !! And yes, she has the mark in her eye and yes she speaks english. The photo is compared with photos from the internet.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice of her to think I should know this isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark in her eye? What? I’m not familiar with any marks on any eyes. But like the tabloids will probably say when Connie sends this in to them for publication, there’s “evidence” somewhere in the picture, even if they have to invent it. I have sent these pics to Bryan and Baxter who will be examining them closely. We will no doubt be discussing them and other Connie issues on Warning Radio this coming Monday night, August 17th at 8:00 p.m.  &lt;a href="http://www.warningradio.info/Warning/Home.html"&gt;www.warningradio.info/Warning/Home.html &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:232px"&gt;&lt;img title="evilglobe1" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/evilglobe1.jpg" alt="The &amp;quot;evilglobe&amp;quot; including eye (evil of course)" width="222" height="286"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;evilglobe&amp;quot; including eye (evil of course)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see what Connie’s  talking about. But this is not unusual. If Maddie is such a lynch-pin to world dominance like Connie says, would they take a child out into the open where she could be seen and photographed! Connie’s logic defies the wildest imagination, but I suppose that’s what psychics have been known to do for centuries. Look at the wild stuff Jean Dixon and Nostradamus put out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our 20 minute interview, I stayed focused on her every move as I would have with a client or sitter I might be doing a reading for: watching for body language, ticks, voice patterns and other telltale clues. She was very slick and well rehearsed in her delivery of the conspiracy theory she was pitching. There was not the slightest bit of nervousness or tension one might expect from a person in possession of such dangerous information. It was as if she was talking about re-painting her garage. All the while I kept thinking to myself that if even a tiny bit of what she was telling me had any speck of truth to it,  (huge government conspiracies, secret societies, tons of money, murder and kidnapping, 2012 doom and gloom and the standard New World Order line) it would seem reasonable that spreading around such talk could well take a turn for the worse for Connie and anyone around her. If what she’s saying is all that top secret and hush hush, she would probably have been “disappeared” long ago by the dark forces she’s in such a dither to track down. How can she go outside at night? How could she manage to get any laundry done, tie her shoelaces or go from day to day with such momentous infromation in her head? How does she just slip past the very thugs she’s tagging? If it was me, I’d be keeping my big mouth shut. It would seem an easy matter to dispose of her rather quietly. What’s one less psychic in the grand scheme of Bilderbergers, Illuminati henchmen and government goons anyway? She has traipsed around Spain, England, France, Portugal and America on the trail of Maddie. Surely at one of those places she could have been poisoned, strangled or taken out by now? Even a little food poisoning incident would lend some credence to her story. Connie: If you want some realism, figure out how to hog-tie, Duct tape your mouth closed and get deposited in some landfill somewhere. Now &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;would be news that will get you noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="illuminatiBash1" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/illuminatiBash13-225x195.jpg" alt="Illuminati Descendants Assemble for an Eyes Wide Shut-like &amp;quot;Heaven and Hell&amp;quot; Bash " width="225" height="195"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illuminati Descendants Assemble for an Eyes Wide Shut-like &amp;quot;Heaven and Hell&amp;quot; Bash &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to end up as part of a freeway underpass myself. If I’m to believe all her fear mongering, it could have the effect of making me  more paranoid than I already am. If The Bilderbergers really have control over Ben Bernanke, use live puppies for ashtrays, have space lasers in place and anal probes everywhere, Connie may well have a place in history.  But cooler heads must prevail. In the unlikely event that dear Maddie is out there reading this on some errant computer screen in some Bond villain style bunker deep beneath the earth’s crust, please sneak a note out in a clothes hamper and let us know where you are and if you are eating well. I’m certainly interested in what you or any of the other inmates down there have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Shallenberger (Hmmmmm, Shallen – Berger, as in Bilder – Berger?) sent me a note she received through Bart Farkas at JREF from Connie threatening to expose JREF and of their “cheating” her. In her message Connie called me a liar. Actually, she spelled it LIAR in all caps as she has an annoying habit of doing. My response was to wonder what exactly I had lied to her about? I can’t recall lying about anything.  Them’s fighting words where I come from. I simply gave Connie every opportunity to air her intrigues and machinations. I emailed Connie directly asking her to explain her accusation and at first she only responded that she would get back to me “later.”  This is one of her re-occurring strategies. Everything will be revealed &lt;em&gt;at some later time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:213px"&gt;&lt;img title="ben1" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/ben1.jpg" alt="Big Ben under Repair" width="203" height="152"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Ben under Repair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budding Psychics Take Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s call this ruse &lt;strong&gt;“The Big Ben Effect.”&lt;/strong&gt;  Connie’s deflection technique reminds me of Uri Geller’s famous prediction he made in the British tabloids. He stated that he would stop Big Ben from ticking and for &lt;em&gt;twenty&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; he kept harping on it until finally Big Ben actually did stop for 90 minutes, at which time Uri jumped to the occasion saying, “…You see! I told you I would do it!.”  This is called taking advantage of the moment and to his everlasting credit, Uri is a master at this subterfuge. I confess to using this dodge a few times myself anytime I can if something like a light bulb or a streetlight blinks out. Whatever:  take credit for it! Those thousands of people who didn’t know that Geller had predicted this would happen for years and only read the banner headline the day it happened of course thought he was a genuine clairvoyant. Timing is everything. I’m afraid that even though Connie has honored Uri by making use of his method, she just hasn’t got the same chutzpah (or track record) going for her to pull this off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie: We can’t wait for twenty years (or until 2012, whichever dire event comes first.) Perhaps you need a better agent or someone like Uri’s Shipi Shtang, who is “quietly present” at most of his public appearances and somehow manages to be around with extra spoons and watches whenever he needs them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally got a message back from Connie today. Direct from her own email, again un-corrected and in its raw form. Not surprisingly, she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mark, you are a big liar, because you are NOT the person you acted like, when I met you. I did like you until I read what you wrote !! But we`ll see about it all, who are right and who are wrong!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="Jeane_Dixon_1" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Jeane_Dixon_1-225x273.jpg" alt="Jean Dixon predicted the Russians would land on the moon first and a cure for cancer by 1967." width="225" height="273"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean Dixon predicted the Russians would land on the moon first and a cure for cancer by 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds a tad threatening doesn’t it? She liked me until she read my post &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Connie’s Conundrum”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; here at Skepticblog. She’s not a very good psychic if it took that long to “read” me. Why couldn’t you see through my thin veneer of woo bait when you first met me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second email, I asked her to explain these things and offered her an invitation to view “THE TRUTH!” Connie’s message to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mark, you are very wrong….the things are NOT what they seems too, but you will realize it when the time is right, and I don`t have to see your videos at all :-) !”&lt;br&gt;
Connie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so don’t take nine minutes out of your busy psychic day to watch my youtube video and perhaps indulge in seeing my point of view. Noboby is forcing you to recant or convert. It was just a suggestion. So here’s yet another humorless shut-eye psychic!  The next email reply I recieved from Connie after merely asking two simple answers from her: &lt;em&gt;1) Prove it.  &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;2) When?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She responded last night with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When the right time comes. As I have told before, I can`t say a time, only with some of it….you just have to take one step at time, like the rest of us!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only “some of it…?”  Okay, I’ll take ”some”  if that’’s all you can offer Connie. Let’s have it. Or is that “some” just the part you will be taking advantage of when news of Maddie’s death or some such clue one day hits CNN? Again she’s sticking to the “time is right” coda again. I’ll have to check with Uri to see what time that will be, but I won’t be setting my watch to it. Maybe Big Ben can tell us exactly when?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s with the “one step at a time” deal? Is she in AA or something? I have no problem with that. Perhaps she should be in a twelve step program. It might help her commuincation skills. Maybe I should start a twelve step program for recovering psychics? Her “like the rest of us” response begs the question: Is she talking about the rest of us normal people? Or does she mean the rest of us dowsers and self-appointed psychic detectives? You simply can’t have it both ways Connie: If you are  psychic, you shouldn’t have to wait for anything, right? It’s all there floating around in ”the ether” or stored up in the “Akashic Records” or wherever that stuff is kept on file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR THE RECORD: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connie, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I never lied to you. I  merely followed my own methods of getting information the way I have learned to do it when I was working the room like you. It’s not unlike your own methods, minus the dowsing shtick. It really works “like magic” too. Your responses were and are nowhere near what I have come to expect from a true believer. A true believer would have gracefully bowed out (as you initially did on the Sunday night after TAM7) and quietly gone back to the fold that embraced their belief in you and your powers. That should have been enough for someone who believes in their “gift” and their “mission.” Instead, you went on the offensive and made an issue against the very protocol you signed off on and chose to get snarky with some of the world’s biggest experts in the field. Sour grapes? A boatload full I’d say. A person in possession of any one of the powers and abilities you give yourself credit for having wouldn’t need to cry foul. They would have much better things to do. The truth about you is self-evident.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As far as me being a LIAR : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you fight fire with fire, you just might get burned. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skeptics Take Note.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

PopABC: A program to infer historical demographics parameters

Lopes, Balding and Beaumont

Abstract

Summary: PopABC is a computer package for inferring the pattern of demographic divergence of closely related populations and species. The software performs coalescent simulation in the framework of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). PopABC can also be used to perform [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as scientifically educated individuals, do frequently engage in discussions with the public, even if we do not realize it. I can recall instances of sitting at coffee shops and casually entering conversations about evolutionary biology, chemistry, genetics, and many other topics with various people. This is where woo frequently has a leg up on science. The pushers of woo do “grass roots” and “word-of-mouth” spreading of their ideas while science is something many people are genuinely interested in talking about science. The actual scientific discoveries are, I find, quite exciting, but the research itself is something very few individuals can effectively sift through; looking at the methods, analysis, and conclusions, then upon critical examination, conclude if the study does demonstrate what is stated. I don’t think there is anything inherently “wrong” with any method of spreading this information. Different methods will work for different individuals. Target audiences for most science (those without any dogmatically held beliefs on the subject) vary with the type of research as well. The obnoxious creationist loudmouth that thinks the Earth is 6,000 years old and fossils were put there by a supernatural entity to tempt us from Jeebus are not, in fact, the target audience of any discussion. It is, instead, the individual that is convinced by the arguments that cdesign proponentists have any scientific standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is partially what I find so disturbing with many individuals saying “we need to reach the creationists.” No, we do not, you cannot argue with someone who thinks belief in something proves it exists. It is a waste of time to think you can convince them. What, instead, we must target our arguments towards are the individuals listening, the ones the creationists are going after, and reach them first and arm them with the information to refute exactly what the creationists are saying. Responding to every criticism of evolution or geology or genetics rather than putting THEM on the defensive. We must get the cdesign proponentists to state their claims and dismantle them publicly. While they are not the most scientifically adept individuals, they are very, very good at advertising. This is where scientific discourse often fails; we like to let the evidence speak for itself, and while it is always good in a court of law to have all the evidence favoring your position, public opinion is where political policy is formed. This, unfortunately, does not always fall on the side of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public scientists (Eugenie Scott and Neil deGrasse Tyson come to mind) are great, but we need to engage in these discussions on a personal level. How easy is it to convince an anti-vaxer the chemical in vaccines they fear isn’t &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228"&gt;in there anymore&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of trace quantities  in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPT_vaccine"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt; by one manufacturer and most influenza vaccines except Fluzone) and to get the damn vaccine so we don’t see another &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/MeaslesUpdate/"&gt;Measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. I promise, there’s no thimerosal in the MMR vaccines. Even IF there was a statistically significant risk from thimerosal, (there isn’t) it doesn’t matter! These are the issues we must explain to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy"&gt;the uneducated&lt;/a&gt; out there because there are some who will gladly tell &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield"&gt;lies&lt;/a&gt; for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission, should you choose to accept it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary objective=engage in at least one discussion per week about the scientific topic you feel most comfortable with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary objective=question THEIR ideas without presenting your own and only present your ideas when asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how good science spreads, if you question someone enough, they will eventually find the evidence (or lack of it) for their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

Over recent months, Universities have been "consulted" on new procedures for &lt;a href="http://jrsm.rsmjournals.com/cgi/content/citation/101/11/524"&gt;self investigation&lt;/a&gt; (and effective cover-up) of research fraud (see &lt;a href="http://www.ukrio.org/resources/UKRIO%20Code%20of%20Practice%20for%20Research%20-%20public%20consultation%20document.pdf"&gt;consultation&lt;/a&gt;). The General Medical Council is &lt;a href="http://www.medicalprotection.org/uk/latest-news/GMC-launches-consultation-on-patient-research"&gt;"consulting"&lt;/a&gt; about their (already reasonable) guidance for doctors who fake research - while they fail to deal with actual doctors who have brought shame on the clinical research enterprise. The GMC is also &lt;a href="http://www.medicalprotection.org/uk/latest-news/Consultations-launched-on-ftp-management"&gt;"consulting"&lt;/a&gt; on how it could "improve its procedures for handling Fitness to Practice cases".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much of what passes for "consultation" is theater designed to create an illusion that serious problems with these organisations are being addressed. I have yet to see actual examples of regulatory integrity lapses, cover-up and cock-up included within any consultation document.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funniest of all is the current consultation on government regulation of "&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007"&gt;Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK&lt;/a&gt;". David Colquhoun is lucid on the problem of what we are regulating. He discusses in some detail examination papers and teaching material from degree courses on acupuncture and Chinese medicine at the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1950"&gt;University of Salford&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043"&gt;University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thejabberwock.org/blog/2/salfordacu.gif" width="500" height="212" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10"&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am hardly a defender of the current state of medicine. Scientific medicine, medical leadership, and genuine evidence-based medicine are in a shambles right now. This is in part because of government interference, and because regulators have assisted in the "normalisation" of scientific fraud. It seems to me that there are a few things to address before "consulting" on the mechanics of regulation for these practitioners. Yet again, the clear message from government is that honest science and evidence are not on their agenda. Regulation and yet more guidance are not the solution to our problems - they are the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I differ slightly from David in that I don't care that ill folk choose to get all sorts of advice. Nor do I care that such wares are sold, so long as they describe exactly what they do (see &lt;a href="http://www.fdhom.co.uk/index.asp"&gt;this company&lt;/a&gt;), and I don't foot the bill. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any event, why regulate only these specific practitioners and techniques? Given my African origins I responded to the consultation with the helpful suggestion that we consider the regulatory normalisation of other therapeutic techniques such as scarification or &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/241221.stm"&gt;FGM&lt;/a&gt;, drugs such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muti"&gt;muti&lt;/a&gt; (human or otherwise), and diagnostic technologies such as &lt;a href="http://www.southafricalogue.com/travel-tips/sangomas-the-south-african-shamen.html"&gt;bone throwing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2009/05/can-we-bank-on-trust.html"&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/"&gt;Main Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/30682564-5630857138190384405?l=scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Aubrey Blumsohn)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/ScientificMisconductBlog</id><title type="html">Scientific Misconduct Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250365584591"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/john_hughes_whoever_that_was_i.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ea90bf11148e2e1f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">John Hughes, whoever that was, is dead.</title><published>2009-08-15T20:13:38Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T20:13:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/-baP50x3hGk/john_hughes_whoever_that_was_i.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/john_hughes_whoever_that_was_i.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I guess this guy was not from any of my generations, but you can read all about it &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/08/destroy-ferris/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/john_hughes_whoever_that_was_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/-baP50x3hGk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250364285068"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8857">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5aad427f9f974234</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">AI: Ink</title><published>2009-08-15T19:00:23Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T19:00:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8857" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I recover from last night’s tattoo session, another chip in the very long process of finishing this back piece we’ve been working on, I thought I’d ask you all about the topic.  It seems that tattoos have become fairly ubiquitous; no longer the sole property of the outre.&lt;br&gt;
In my case, at age 18, I went into a tattoo shop on a whim, not really knowing what I was going to get, and wound up with a little eye of Horus on my left shoulder.  Given my lifelong fascination with Egyptian archaeology and culture, it just made sense.  And now, almost twelve years later, I’m still covering my body in Egyptian art.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any tattoos?  What factors have influenced this choice?  What do you have/would you get and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As she floats off to gaze at the algae and the crabs, I use the awesome wireless on this island to check my email The outline is in my inbox. So by the time she’s done snorkeling, we can discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m doing my best to counter this tranquility by editing these students nearly to the point of tears. But my impersonation of John Houseman in the &lt;em&gt;Paper Chase&lt;/em&gt; just can’t measure up on a day like this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250362771166"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/but_will_they_come_when_you_do.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37fc9d16cc07923b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">But will they come when you do call for them?</title><published>2009-08-15T19:43:16Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T19:43:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/OWrFNj8_TKQ/but_will_they_come_when_you_do.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/but_will_they_come_when_you_do.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Peter Irons wrote a letter to Murray Gell-Mann.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Gell-Mann,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may (or may not) know that Stuart Pivar has included on the jacket and promotional materials for his new book, On the Origin of Form, a purported endorsement by you of the book, which reads: "This is the discovery of the connection between the laws of physics and the complexity of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Pivar used the same quote, attributed to you, in promoting his previous book, Life Code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have learned that this quote is drawn from promotional material written by the publicist for your book, The Quark and the Jaguar, which reads: "This is Gell-Mann's own story of finding the connections between the basic laws of physics and the complexity and diversity of the natural world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have raised with Mr. Pivar and Jon Goodspeed, editorial director of North Atlantic Books, the distributor of On the Origin of Form, the question of whether you in fact have authorized Mr. Pivar and Mr. Goodspeed to use the above quote in promoting the book.  Neither has yet replied, which prompts this message to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a comment posted on August 14 on the science blog Pharyngula, Mr. Pivar has written, in response to my questions, that "Murray Gell Man (sic) has visited my lab three or four times in the past year, has read the book and compared it to the statement on the cover of his own book...."  He seems to be asserting that you havee given him verbal authorization to use the above quote in promoting his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most reputable publishers have a standard practice of requiring that authors provide them with written authorization from potential "blurbers" of quotes attributed to them.  I'm sure you will agree this is a reasonable practice, to protect publishers from possible complaints or even lawsuits from persons whose words are used without authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By way of background, I understand that North Atlantic Books has already held up distribution of Mr. Pivar's book after receiving a complaint from Dr. Robert Hazen, an eminent geologist at the Carnegie Institute in Washington, that Mr. Pivar intended to use excerpts from private communications between him and Dr. Hazen in promoting the book, selecting only those few favorable comments about the theory proposed by Mr. Pivar, and deleting the more numerous critical comments.  This is a practice known as "cherry-picking" or "quote-mining," to which Dr. Hazen understandably objected.  Mr. Pivar has threatened to sue Dr. Hazen for demanding that his largely negative review be used in its entirely, or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a simple question: have you authorized either Mr. Pivar or Mr. Goodspeed, in writing, to use the quote attributed to you in promoting Mr. Pivar's book?  You may have done so, or will do so in response to this message, in which case this issue will become moot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would very much appreciate a response to this message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Irons, Ph.D., J.D. &lt;br&gt;Professor of Political Science, Emeritus&lt;br&gt;University of California, San Diego&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what do you know, he replies out of the vasty deep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Professor Irons,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The answer is No.  I never authorized using any endorsement by me of
Stuart Pivar's book.   I did hear that something of the sort might
happen and called to prevent it, but I was too late.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Murray Gell-Mann&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the reporters who joined us in Kentucky has a nice article &lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/53237252.html?elr=KArksUUUoDEy3LGDiO7aiU"&gt;on the Creation "Museum" trip in the Star Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I appreciate about it is that he actually quotes us on the scientific flaws in the exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very silly quote from Ken Ham, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our own, full-time Ph.D. scientists and many other scientists who work in the secular world provided the research for the museum scripts," replied Ham. "This man is obviously very angry at God and relishes in mocking Christianity -- spending a lot of his time fighting against someone he doesn't believe exists!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, repeating a lie does not make it true. There is no research backing up the &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; — there is ideology and religion and a crack team of highly educated crackpots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he repeats his desperate &lt;i&gt;ad hominem&lt;/i&gt; — yes, I&amp;#39;m an atheist, and yes, I dislike religion. So? That has nothing to do with the validity of those ghastly ignorant exhibits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/now_im_a_firebrand.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/BzuSwH02xn8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250356459115"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2073">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/548145dd18d7df9b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conservatives for Patients' Rights"/><category term="Karol Sikora"/><category term="NHS"/><category term="National Health Service"/><category term="UCL Hospitals"/><category term="UCLH"/><category term="managerialism"/><category term="Alan Crockard"/><category term="Andrew Colquhoun"/><category term="Obama"/><title type="html">Why I love the National Health Service (NHS)</title><published>2009-08-15T16:16:31Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T16:16:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2073" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.dcscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/#follow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jump to follow-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservatives in the USA have been lying about the NHS on a massive scale. As Simon Hoggart &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2009/aug/15/simon-hoggarts-week"&gt;comments today&lt;/a&gt; “There are few tribes more loathsome than the American right”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the forefront has been a far-right lobby group, Conservatives for Patients’ Rights (CPR).  Even I was surprised to read in the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/05/10/ST2009051002320.html"&gt;Washington&lt;br&gt;
Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The campaign is being coordinated by CRC Public Relations, the group that masterminded the “Swift boat” attacks against 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, John F. Kerry”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=CRC_Public_Relations" title="CRC Public Relations"&gt;CRC Public Relations&lt;/a&gt; is a conservative PR firm previously known as Creative Response Concepts.  ‘Creative’ appears to mean ‘lying’, but I guess that is what PR is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of CPR, Rick Scott, has an interesting background.  According to &lt;a href="http://www.insurancereformwatch.org/opposition/cpr.shtml"&gt;Stephen Barrett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “In 1987, he founded and became chief operating officer of a hospital chain that grew into the $23 billion-a-year Columbia/HCA. In 1997, a few weeks after the FBI raided HCA hospitals in five states, Scott was ousted as CEO and three executives were indicted on charges of Medicare fraud. The FBI’s investigation found that the hospital chain had been overbilling Medicare and giving  kickbacks to doctors who steered patients to its hospitals. The overbilling included upcoding lesser procedures to get higher reimbursements and billing for lab tests that were not medically necessary  and were not ordered by physicians. The situation was settled with a set of guilty pleas and criminal and civil fines totalling $1.7 billion.. The U.S. Department of Justice referred to the matter as the “largest health care fraud case in U.S. history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disgracefully, Karol Sikora, a former oncologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, supported CPR on US television. See &lt;a href="http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2009/05/karol-sikora-makes-fool-of-himself.html"&gt;Karol&lt;br&gt;
Sikora makes a fool of himself&lt;/a&gt; at NHSblogdoctor. I quote&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Karol Sikora had been duped by a slick American businessman into providing a “rent-a-quote” service for a notorious right-wing American organisation”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was reproduced on the US site,&lt;a href="http://trusted.md/feed/items/system/2009/05/14/karol_sikora_makes_a_fool_of_himself"&gt; Trusted.MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sikora now works for the UK’s only private university and a private cancer treatment company.  He is also famous for &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college"&gt;claiming,&lt;br&gt;
falsely,&lt;/a&gt; to be a professor at Imperial College (he has an honorary contract with the Imperial College Hospital Trust but nothing with the University).  And for promoting  a load of nonsense about&lt;br&gt;
alternative medicine (a lot more on that coming up shortly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This is why love the NHS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe as a whole gets better health care for less money than in the USA.  The fact that every US doctor has a financial interest in ordering   expensive treatments whether they are needed or not,&lt;br&gt;
  is an obscenity.  The fact that over 40 million Americans have no insurance is an obscenity (see &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-brutal-truth-about-americarsquos-healthcare-1772580.html"&gt;The  brutal truth about America’s healthcare&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at the numbers (Source: WHO/OECD Health Data 2009)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health spending as a share of GDP. &lt;br&gt;
US 16%      UK 8.4%&lt;/p&gt;

US 6.7   UK 4.8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I know this is anecdote, but it matters a lot to me. I already posted a &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=645#uclh"&gt;version of this story&lt;/a&gt;, but this seems like the time to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On December 13th 1984, my wife had a subarachnoid haemorrhage when she was seven months pregnant.  After an initial misdiagnosis by an obstetrician at St Peter’s Hospital, Chertsey, she was moved to UCH and diagnosed very quickly.  The next morning I was called to see the neurourgeon, the great Alan Crockard. He was sitting surrounded by medical students some of whom I’d taught the previous year. He told me my wife had had a subarachnoid haemorrhage (at 33!) and they would operate straight away. And “I have to ask you, if we can save only the mother or the baby, which shall it be”.  It’s as well to write that down because even 24 years later I can’t say it without a lump rising in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; That same day she had neurosurgery to pin an aneurysm at the Maida Vale Neurosurgical Hospital, part of the UCLH group (it no longer exists).  The surgeon, Alan Crockard, came out of theatre after five hours, looking rather tired and said “it was adhered to the optic chiasma on one side and about a millimetre from the pituitary on the other.  It was a bit tricky but I think we got it”.  Obstetricians were in theatre too because all this was done with the baby still &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;After a week in intensive care, under heavy sedation, Margaret’s blood pressure was not low enough and they decided to deliver the baby.  At about 4 pm on a snowy Christmas Eve, a team of neurosurgeons and a team of obstetricians gathered and soon after, Andrew Stuart Colquhoun emerged in a small incubator to be whisked off in an ambulance to the Special Care Baby Unit at UCH (run, at that time, by &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1029934&amp;amp;blobtype=pdf"&gt;Osmund&lt;br&gt;
        Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;). Christmas day was spent in the hospital, with Margaret’s mother.   Andrew weighed 1.4 kg at birth, but by Christmas day he had pulled out his ventilator himself, and was doing  fine. He was so tiny that it was a couple of days before I dared to hold him. The Unit had racks of doll-sized clothes, knitted by volunteers. The care was superb.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a title="See the album" href="http://www.dcscience.net/ac-birth/index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://dcscience.net/ac-9days-2-jan-1985-2vs.jpg" alt="Andrew&amp;#39;s birth"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew (at 9 days) and Dad. Jan 2, 1985. Click for album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Once Margaret was well enough, she was given a side room in a neurosurgical ward with a cot for Andrew by her bed, an arrangement that gave the neurosurgical nurses some fun. They were in UCLH continuously until 27th April before Margaret had recovered enough to go home, [&lt;a title="Photo album " href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/jalbums/ac-birth/index.html"&gt;Full photo album here&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now they are both fine.and &lt;a title="Andrew Colquhoun&amp;#39;s photo page" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/andrew.html"&gt;Andrew  is 6′ 7″ (200.5 cm)&lt;/a&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is episodes like this that make one very proud of the NHS.  She and Andrew were in hospital continuously for more than four months.  Not a penny changed hands.  Heaven knows what it would have cost in the USA, or even of insurance would have covered such a gargantuan bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;My own experience&lt;/strong&gt; is trivial compared with that of Margaret and Andrew, but it has been as near perfect as anyone could wish.  I had a lumbar spinal fusion (L3 – L4) in 1995, after several attempts at less drastic solutions.  I’ve had two artificial hips.  They allowed me to walk across the Alps for my 65th birthday. Then a few trivial things like bilateral hernia and DVT (I had been scanned and was on anticoagulant therapy within 4 hours of walking into UCLH’s Accident and Emergency).  And now it looks as though I’ll be getting a partial or total nephrectomy too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not a penny has changed hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS is a beautiful thing.  OK it has has the usual excessive number of managers and HR-bollocks, like most big companies.  It isn’t perfect but it is a great deal closer to perfection&lt;br&gt;
  than the US system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush may have gone, but a large fraction of Americans seem to be unrepentant Bush-ites. Almost all of my many friends in the USA think more or less like I do.  Even Obama is to the right of most European conservatives, The other 48% are to the right of Attila the Hun. The extent of the polarisation that still exists is nothing short of terrifying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the great &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurin_Bevan"&gt;Aneurin Bevan&lt;/a&gt; who established the NHS in 1948 for ordinary people like me, in the face of fierce opposition from the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;” . . . no society can legitimately call itself civilised if a sick person is denied medical aid because of lack of means.”&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Paul Krugman&lt;/strong&gt; in the New York Times is magnificent as always. In&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/opinion/17krugman.html?_r=2"&gt; The Swiss Menace&lt;/a&gt; he points out that Obama’s scheme is nothing like the NHS anyway, but more like that in Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The plans on the table would, roughly speaking, turn America into Switzerland — which may be occupied by lederhosen-wearing holey-cheese eaters, but wasn’t a socialist hellhole the last time I looked.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“In Britain, the government itself runs the hospitals and employs the doctors. We’ve all heard scare stories about how that works in practice; these stories are false.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“So we can do this. At this point, all that stands in the way of universal health care in America are the greed of the medical-industrial complex, the lies of the right-wing propaganda machine, and the gullibility of voters who believe those lies.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing US and UK cancer statistics&lt;/strong&gt; .  As Ben Goldacre says, “I think you’ll find it’s a bit more complicated than that”.   There’s an interesting  analysis at &lt;a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2009/08/17/we-need-to-be-careful-when-comparing-us-and-uk-cancer-care/"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So although it’s undoubtedly ‘better’ at spotting prostate cancers, it’s also fair to say that some of these Americans will never die from their disease.  This ‘&lt;a title="Overdiagnosis - wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdiagnosis"&gt;overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt;‘ inflates the survival statistics, at the expense of ‘&lt;a title="Overtreatment" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/overtreatment"&gt;overtreating&lt;/a&gt;‘ men – which  is &lt;a title="New Scientist - Condition critical - The medical crisis facing America " href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926744.700-condition-critical-the-medical-crisis-facing-america.html"&gt;expensive&lt;/a&gt; and can cause long-term side effects (which can need further treatment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the age-standardised death rates per 100,000 people are almost the same in the UK (all races) when compared with the USA (whites only). What is different is that far more cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in the USA. If the rate of ‘real’ (potentially fatal) prostate cancer were similar in both countries then both countries have much the same success in treating it, If, on the other hand, US men had a genuinely higher incidence of real prostate cancer, the US would be doing better, There is no way to distinguish between these two interpretations,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Comer, whose lawsuit challenging the Texas Education Agency’s policy of requiring neutrality about evolution and creationism was dismissed on March 31, 2009, is now appealing the decision. Formerly the director of science at the TEA, Comer was forced to resign in November 2007 after she forwarded a note announcing a talk by Barbara Forrest in Austin; according to a memorandum recommending her dismissal, “the TEA requires, as agency policy, neutrality when talking about evolution and creationism.” In June 2008, Comer filed suit in federal court in the Western District of Texas, arguing that the policy violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment: “By professing ‘neutrality,’ the Agency credits creationism as a valid scientific theory.” The judge ruled (&lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/webfm_send/798" rel="external "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PDF, p. 18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) otherwise, however … In her appellate brief, submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Comer asked (&lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/webfm_send/1170" rel="external "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PDF, p. 39&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) the court to “review the record de novo and reverse and vacate the district court’s decision. Specifically, it should grant Comer’s motion for summary judgment, and vacate the grant of summary judgment for defendants, as well as the dismissal of plaintiff’s complaint. At a minimum, this Court should vacate the grant of summary judgment to defendants, plus the order dismissing the complaint, and remand for further proceedings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… He saw mountains casting shadows on the moon and realised this body was a world, like the Earth, endowed with complicated terrain. He saw the moons of Jupiter — objects that circled another heavenly body in direct disobedience of the church’s teaching. He saw the moonlike phases of Venus, indicating that this planet circled the sun, not the Earth, in even greater disobedience of the priests. He saw sunspots, demonstrating that the sun itself was not the perfect orb demanded by the Greek cosmology that had been adopted by the church…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nearly 400 years ago that Galileo demonstrated his telescope for the first time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has only been 150 years since Charles Darwin published &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of those scientists do you think did more damage to religious institutions and their claims to the “truth”?&lt;/p&gt;

How did I forget to plug the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt;? This time around, it's the &lt;a href="http://ionian-enchantment.blogspot.com/2009/08/skeptics-circle-117-chiropractic.html"&gt;Skeptics Circle #117: The Chiropractic Edition&lt;/a&gt; and it's here to readjust your subluxated skepticism. Or something. Either way, it's a hoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do fear one thing though. Mike Meadon referred to the Skeptics' Circle as "venerable." Back when a blogger named St. Nate started this whole thing and then a few months later handed it off to me, way back in 2005, I never would have ever thought that one day the Circle would be referred to as "venerable."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, I'm so old. Or my blog is. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, next up on August 27 is &lt;a href="http://evolvingmind.info/blog"&gt;The Evolving Mind&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to get your skeptical brains working to produce the fodder for yet another in the venerable line of skeptical explorations that the Circle has become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was perusing the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;schedule for upcoming Skeptics' Circles&lt;/a&gt;, and I noticed that there are openings to host on October 22 and November 5, which shockingly, are not that far away. After that, other than December 17, there are no openings until late January. So, if you're interested, now's the time to volunteer, before those three openings are snagged by eager skeptical rogues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/holy_crap_im_slipping_a_subluxation_and.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/mN_vC9VEzOE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250353067798"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-1685726791636289981">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0de45cdb2a62e503</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="accomodationism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Michael Ruse of beliefnet builds a giant strawman</title><published>2009-08-14T16:52:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T16:52:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/08/michael-ruse-of-beliefnet-builds-giant.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; at BeliefNet is so full of shit I'm not even going to go all the way through it, but I just want to point out that as soon as he starts going after the so-called "New Atheists", he averages at least two lies per paragraph.

Lie #2:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Distinctive of this group, although well known to anyone who studies religion and the way in which sects divide and proliferate, is the fact that...nothing incurs their wrath than those who are pro-science but who refuse to agree that all and every kind of religious belief is wrong, pernicious, and socially and personally dangerous. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riiiight... because voicing any sort of disagreement is the same thing as &amp;quot;wrath&amp;quot;.  With the exception of PZ&amp;#39;s writings about Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum (who, I have to say, kindof started it when they mercilessly attacked PZ in their book), I cannot think of a single piece of writing by a so-called &amp;quot;New Atheist&amp;quot; which expresses &amp;quot;wrath&amp;quot; towards someone who is pro-science.  An example of this gross distortion of reality will be found in Lie #3:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Recently, it has been the newly appointed director of the NIH, Francis Collins, who has been incurring their hatred. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hatred?  Hatred?!?  Really?!?!?  What fucking planet is this guy &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt;?!?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/monday_must_be_pick_on_francis.php"&gt;PZ on Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The situation is this: the White House has picked for high office a well-known scientist with a good track record in management who wears clown shoes. Worse, this scientist likes to stroll about with his clown shoes going squeak-squeak-squeak, pointing them out to everyone, and bragging about how red and shiny and gosh-darned big his shoes are, and tut-tutting at the apparent lack of fine fashion sense exhibited by his peers who wear rather less flamboyant footwear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would rather Obama had appointed someone who wore practical shoes, and didn't make much of a fuss about them, anyway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/francis-collins-as-nih-director/"&gt;Jerry Coyne on Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; I guess my first reaction would be to give the guy a break, and take a wait-and-see attitude towards his stewardship of the NIH.  After all, he doesn’t seem to have let his superstition get in the way of his other administrative tasks, and he doesn’t seem to be the vindictive type, either...I won’t grouse too much about this, but do want to emphasize again that the guy is deeply, deeply superstitious, to the point where, on his website BioLogos and his book The Language of God, he lets his faith contaminate his scientific views. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/the_strange_case_of_francis_collins2/"&gt;Sam Harris on Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While his stewardship of the NIH seems unlikely to impede our mincing progress on embryonic stem cell research, his appointment seems like another one of President Obama’s efforts to split difference between real science and real ethics on the one hand and religious superstition and taboo on the other. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wow, those mean New Atheists.  They said that Collins "wears funny shoes", that while he is "deeply superstitious" we won't "grouse too much about this", and, horror of horrors, that nasty Sam Harris said that Collins' appointment was a case of "split[ting the] difference".  Oooooooo...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that's "hatred", then surely what Ruse says about the "New Atheists" must be akin to genocide!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asswipe.  I couldn't read any more past that point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-1685726791636289981?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250353067797"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-8711182257995915024">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/70c21fbb076fd9f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="islam" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="judaism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="lolcatz" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="hinduism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="christianity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">LOLGODZ</title><published>2009-08-14T13:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T13:18:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/08/lolgodz.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">My picture I cooked up for my &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/08/breaking-news-terrorists-win.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday about the censoring of a book on the Danish cartoon controversy gave me an idea for a new twist on an old Internet meme:  LOLGODZ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVlkODGfrI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Mil-DEPpHTo/s1600-h/lolgodz+blud+sakrifice.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:189px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVlkODGfrI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Mil-DEPpHTo/s320/lolgodz+blud+sakrifice.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVlkU9Q6TI/AAAAAAAAAFs/WZFarhCI_rc/s1600-h/lolgodz+vishnu.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:223px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVlkU9Q6TI/AAAAAAAAAFs/WZFarhCI_rc/s320/lolgodz+vishnu.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVllOApshI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Hyj_OENK0z4/s1600-h/lolgodz+blind+obedience.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:316px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVllOApshI/AAAAAAAAAF0/Hyj_OENK0z4/s320/lolgodz+blind+obedience.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVllW_8o8I/AAAAAAAAAF8/moK3GSJpPvk/s1600-h/lolgodz+jesus+with+dino.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:234px;height:320px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVllW_8o8I/AAAAAAAAAF8/moK3GSJpPvk/s320/lolgodz+jesus+with+dino.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVlmCc4DpI/AAAAAAAAAGE/G_C8BMRrTtg/s1600-h/lolgodz+muhammed.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:178px;height:320px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SoVlmCc4DpI/AAAAAAAAAGE/G_C8BMRrTtg/s320/lolgodz+muhammed.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think?

&lt;p&gt;Entitled &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/vaccine-fear-campaign-investigated-20090815-elsg.html"&gt;“Vaccine fear campaign to be investigated”&lt;/a&gt; health reporter Louise Hall details allegations about the AVN which she describes as &lt;em&gt;“a group that claims vaccines cause autism, brain damage and cancer..”&lt;/em&gt; who are &lt;em&gt;“…allegedly spreading misinformation and endangering children’s health”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meryl Dorey, the president of the AVN claims that she fills the gap left by the mainstream medical profession and government bodies and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We never have and never will tell anyone that they should not vaccinate. We simply fill the information void left by government and the mainstream medical community.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you do Meryl, you fill the gap with stories of vaccines being the biggest hoaxes of the 20th century, a plot to commit mass genocide and &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/08/01/vaccines-are-part-of-a-world-wide-plot-to-commit-mass-genocide-this-is-not-a-conspiracy/"&gt;a method for the “illuminati” to implant all recipients with microchips&lt;/a&gt;. And you and your followers tell parents that vaccines contain toxic levels of mercury and aluminium, plus cells from aborted fetuses (amongst other things), cause shaken baby syndrome (or shaken “maybe” syndrome), vaccines have never been tested, there is no science to back up the benefits of vaccination, homeopathy, a healthy lifestyle and a loving family are suitable alternatives to vaccination, kids are meant to get childhood illnesses, whooping cough is not that serious, swine flu is a manufactured epidemic, vaccination efforts in the third world “put Hitler and Stalin in the shade”, and that doctors are a danger to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Meryl is also an &lt;a href="http://www.aras.ab.ca/rethinkers.php"&gt;HIV/AIDS denier&lt;/a&gt; as well as being a member of the Facebook group &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/search/?q=australians+against+vaccination&amp;amp;init=quick#/group.php?gid=95810416273&amp;amp;ref=search&amp;amp;sid=100000120757545.1430620992..1"&gt;Australians against vaccination* &lt;/a&gt;(odd, since she claims to be “pro-choice”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need confirmation of the depths these people will sink to, then please read &lt;a href="http://blog.fuzztwin.com/?p=1284"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;, which was left on my blog in response to a &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/06/18/toni-mccaffery-has-had-enough/"&gt;post by Toni McCaffery&lt;/a&gt;, the mother of Dana who died from whooping cough at 4 weeks of age, some 6 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then convince me that these people are well meaning and care about the health of children.&lt;/p&gt;

Finding young Earth creationist lunacy is like walking into an elephant paddock at a zoo and hoping to find poop. All too easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this because in England, thinking the Loch Ness monster disproves evolution can help get you a job! A group there called The National Recognition Information Centre (NARIC) provides information on vocational and academic skills — they’re something like an accreditation group. They reviewed the curriculum involved in getting an International Certificate of Christian Education (ICCE): a certificate granted after passing a creationist course that’s taught in about 50 private Christian schools in the UK. And what did the NARIC find? &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/jul/31/creationist-exams-comparable-to-a-levels"&gt;That this certificate is just fine and dandy&lt;/a&gt;, and equivalent to international A levels (a scholastic certificate that shows competency in a particular course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a sample from a textbook (printed — gasp — here in the US) that is used in this course. Remember, this is part of a course being used by teenagers in the UK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of the ‘Loch Ness Monster’ in Scotland? ‘Nessie,’ for short has been recorded on sonar from a small submarine, described by eyewitnesses, and photographed by others. Nessie appears to be a plesiosaur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could a fish have developed into a dinosaur? As astonishing as it may seem, many evolutionists theorize that fish evolved into amphibians and amphibians into reptiles. This gradual change from fish to reptiles has no scientific basis. No transitional fossils have been or ever will be discovered because God created each type of fish, amphibian, and reptile as separate, unique animals. Any similarities that exist among them are due to the fact that one Master Craftsmen fashioned them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riiiiight. &lt;em&gt;Nessie disproves evolution&lt;/em&gt;. Turns out there’s a whole field of science in there I missed. Faeries disprove the ability of birds to fly! Godzilla clearly shows the surface area/volume law of biology is a crock! Spiderman flies in the face of humans breeding with arachnids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the irony is that creationism itself shows us that despite our highly-evolved brains, humans still cling to easily-disproven nonsense if it’s taught early enough and with fervor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250347203327"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1664">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c3753248a18ba569</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Peeving"/><title type="html">When peeves collide</title><published>2009-08-15T14:28:42Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T14:28:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1664" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;… the result is a grammatical bar brawl.  An excellent example is on display over at Ask MetaFilter, where someone &lt;a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/130197/Like-Bob-and-Me-or-like-Bob-and-I"&gt;innocently asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;And so on. There's some sensible and well-informed advice mixed in with the mud and the blood and the beer, including a link to my discussion of a similar question a few weeks ago ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/?p=1599"&gt;Write like me?&lt;/a&gt;", 7/24/2009).

&lt;p&gt;In this case, an ample supply of the relevant clues can be found in two entries in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;MWDEU&lt;/a&gt;. The first is the entry for &lt;em&gt;between you and I&lt;/em&gt; (p. 181-182):&lt;/p&gt;

Getting all 300 million of us to agree on this isn't going to be easy.  But &lt;a href="http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/americans-without-health-insurance-attack-plan-to-give-them-health-insurance-200908141981/"&gt;a parody circulating on the internet&lt;/a&gt; shows how misunderstood we Americans can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National social programs are relatively new in the States---Medicare, the plan that gives medical care to those over 65, is only forty years old.  Social security, the national pension plan for people who have worked legally for a wage, is about sixty years old.  Welfare programs for the poor are often tolerated at arm's length with the nose held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while many view these programs with disdain or suspicion, few turn them down.  And many of us think these programs contribute to the salvation of our national soul.  But the strong strains of individualism that have existed here for four hundred years cause many Americans to behave in a manner that seems insane to outsiders.  But while ideology contributes to this fear of health care reform, it's only a part of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., most people under 65 get their health insurance from their employers, so as long as they have a job, they may feel safe.   But this hold on health insurance is very tenuous.  Employers looking to save money may drop plans.  If you lose your job, you have to pay impossible amounts for private insurance.  So when someone has insurance, they hold on for dear life, and anything seen to possibly interfere with the status quo may be feared.  To an outsider, it may seem that a segment of Americans are fighting to keep themselves uninsured, but in reality, they are fighting to keep afloat, and change---any change---can seem like an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the reaction against health care reform tells me is not that we are a bunch of idiots who can't recognize our own self-interest, but that we are so frightened we are paralyzed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least some of us.  There is also a pretty big strain of insane wing-nuttery.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/when_it_comes_to_health_care_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/qSfQ-z_htGI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250342539356"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13773">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b57850300e4a90f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Babies"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">What Do You Do with a Plastic Fetus?</title><published>2009-08-15T13:00:49Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T13:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/15/what-do-you-do-with-a-plastic-fetus/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Datamancer&lt;/strong&gt; was doing a project where he needed about 4 to 5 plastic fetuses.  I don’t know what project that was, but I’m curious…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, apparently, plastic fetuses only come in bags of 50.  I did not know this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do with the extras?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;a href="http://www.datamancer.net/fetuses/fetuses.htm"&gt;destroy them and document their fates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Fetus, the other white meat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine works in a deli and shrinkwrapped the fetus I gave him. It even has a custom label that says “Fetus, Male, 6oz.” He had some fun with it for a few days, slipping it into the deli case and messing with people, then later traded it for 2 shots, 3 beers, and 6 cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None too shabby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.datamancer.net/fetuses/tn_shrinkwrapped.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.datamancer.net/fetuses/tn_shrinkwrapped.jpg" width="200" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to get *really* good around fetus #30, I’m sure of it.  &lt;/p&gt;

If one needs to demonstrate it, one has to make sure that a critical stimulus was completely outside of awareness (the so called zero-awareness criterion). Schmidt (2007) poposes two lines of attack for establishing unconscious processing beyond the zero-awareness criterion. The paper deals with different types of dissociation between measures of awareness and measures of processing.Simple DissociationsTo demonstrate that a critical stimulus was processed unconsciously, one usually produces some dissociation between different behavioral measures of performance. This is done by comparing two measures obtained from different tasks. One measure (called the direct measure, D) signals the observer's awareness of a critical stimulus. For example, consider a visual perception experiment, where the task is to detect the offset of a vernier (a vernier is simply a set of two vertical lines, one below the other, where the lower line can be offset either to the right or left of the upper line). However, before the vernier is shown (let's say for 25 msec), a prime is flashed for a short period of time (say 15 msec). This prime could be, for example, arrows pointing to the right or left. A forced-choice prime discrimination task ("Was the arrow to the right or left" ) would measure if the observer was aware of the stimulus, and hence would comprise the direct measure. The second measure (called the indirect measure, I) would indicate that the primes themselves are not consciously detected, but they are involved in a priming effect, and hence affect the reaction times of responding to whether the target vernier is offset to the right or left. For example, if the prime and vernier are both congruent (i.e. the arrow points to the right and the vernier is also offset to the right) and if the subject cannot consciously detect the direction of the prime but the reaction times during the congruent cases are always shorter than the reaction times during the incongruent cases (prime pointing to the right but vernier offset to the left), then this would comprise the indirect measure.Schmidt and Vorberg (2006) examined the assumptions required by the zero-awareness criterion and other approaches. They start by assuming that the direct and indirect measures may depend on two sources of information labeled conscious (c)and unconscious (u). In other words, D = D(c,u)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Collins, a two-year-old rescue cat from Macon, Georgia, has &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32420644/ns/tech_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/"&gt;earned a high school diploma&lt;/a&gt; from Jefferson High School Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Rescued from a ditch when she was no more than a teeny, tiny ball of fluff, Oreo C. Collins, a 2-year-old tuxedo cat from Macon, Ga., may be the very first in her family to obtain a ‘high school diploma’ — online or off. (Of course, we may never know for sure because, as she wrote in her “life experience essay” portion of the test, she’s adopted.) Kelvin Collins, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau of Central Georgia and Oreo’s rescuer, encouraged Oreo to seek her “education,” by taking part in the BBB’s &lt;a href="http://www.bbb.org/us/article/bbb-warns-your-online-diploma-could-be-a-worthless-piece-of-paper-11830"&gt;ongoing investigation of online diploma mills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;“Oreo’s a really smart cat,” Collins said in a telephone interview with msnbc.com. So smart that Oreo garnered mostly As in the online test, with some of her credits earned from her aforementioned life experience essay about her adoption into the Collins family. No doubt that’s why Collins solicited Oreo’s help in the Better Business Bureau’s experiment to expose Internet diploma mills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;Noting her humble beginnings by the side of the road where Collins found her during his son Brennan’s football practice, Oreo’s benefactor said he “is tickled pink to give her an opportunity to get an education.” Following a test and a $200 fee Collins paid for out of his own pocket, the young cat received her diploma from Jefferson High School Online.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't agree with,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have different information than other people (sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes just different), or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;need to be spoken out against,&lt;/li&gt;
and that's when it's time to argue.  Sometimes, there's no way around it, and I need to put myself out there, and make the best argument I can for one side of an issue based on what I know.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this week, I have a conciliatory song from one of my favorite bands that you've probably never heard of, &lt;a href="http://www.storyhill.com/flash_site/index.html"&gt;Storyhill&lt;/a&gt;, and this song is called &lt;b&gt;Continents Collide&lt;/b&gt;.  If I was near Dearwood, MN, I'd definitely go see them this coming Labor Day Weekend.  Take a listen:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_how_to_argue/08%2520Continents%2520Collide%25201.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why pick such a conciliatory song to talk about arguments?  Because there are good ways and bad ways to argue.  Calling someone names?  Probably a bad idea.  Yelling at someone that they're wrong without explaining what's actually correct?  Probably also not the best idea.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you know what the best way actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; to present your arguments?  Fortunately for you, I've found a helpful pyramid to help you formulate your arguments.  At the top is the most effective; at the bottom is the least effective.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_how_to_argue/disagreement-hierarchy.jpg" width="512" title="Although, you know you really *are* an asshat." alt="disagreement-hierarchy.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's sometimes tough to decipher what the central point of someone else's argument &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, because most people don't argue clearly and logically.  But if you can identify it, that's when you win.  When someone else mucks around at the bottom of the pyramid, don't sink to their level; stay up high.  Those top two levels are really the only way to ever change someone's mind, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; to sway other intelligent, thinking people to your side.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are, of course, free to argue however you like.  But if you want to argue &lt;i&gt;on my site&lt;/i&gt;, you're really best off remembering this hierarchy, and staying as high as possible on it.  Most of you do pretty well, but this has served me well in general, and I hope it helps you to see things laid out like this.  And if not, at least you got a great song out of it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/weekend_diversion_how_to_argue.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250319295958"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3967">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce980bb110f8f04b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><category term="lions"/><category term="Racine Zoo"/><title type="html">Caturday felid</title><published>2009-08-15T06:02:56Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T06:02:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/caturday-felid-12/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Greg Mayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two lions are father and son. The son is 23 months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img title="DSCN4089" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/dscn4089.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=225" alt="DSCN4089" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult male lion at Racine Zoo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that at 23 months, the cub is nearly as big as his father, and has lost most, if not all, of the juvenile spotting earlier&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/lion-cubs-in-tusa-zoo/"&gt; noted by Jerry&lt;/a&gt;. In the full size photo, there’s the slightest hint of some spotting remaining on his right thigh.&lt;/p&gt;

In many ways its a good illustration of just how far there is to go in pulling together present knowledge of aging biochemistry into theories that are both unifying and specific: the researchers here argue on mechanisms from a number of quite different and distinct viewpoints. Some of the papers are presently free to read, so take a look while that lasts. Telomere-Mediated Effects on Melanogenesis and Skin Aging UV-induced melanogenesis (tanning) and "premature aging" or photoaging result in large part from DNA damage. This article reviews data tying both phenomena to telomere-based DNA damage signaling and develops a conceptual framework in which both responses may be understood as cancer-avoidance protective mechanisms. Role of Mitochondria in Photoaging of Human Skin: The Defective Powerhouse Model The exact pathogenesis of photoaging of the skin is not yet known. Earlier, a number of molecular pathways explaining one or more characteristics of photoaged skin have been described, but a unifying mechanistic concept is still missing. Here we propose the......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

And as always, &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; back peddles for mainstream press, insisting several times what a great big fan she is of vaccines. Yeah, she loves them so much &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html"&gt;she thinks infants should get only two even though she admits it will bring back many life-ending diseases and cause many casualties&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe. If the vaccine companies are not listening to us, it’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back. They’re making a product that’s s___.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, she LOVES vaccines. . .even though she calls them “shit.” She’s just anti-toxin. Not botox though. Jenny has praised botox, which is the worst toxin out there. It’s sick how many people will throw their kids under the bus in order to worship in the cult of Jenny McCarthy, autism’s cheif false prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

This whole recession thing is making more and more sense every day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;The tax-exempt &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; didn’t buy the lottery ticket. A bunch of people did. And people are not tax-exempt. So why are the individuals not paying taxes on their divided winnings? Even if the money is going to a church, why is it not all after-tax donations? Why are other winners not using this as an excuse? Did the money to buy the lottery ticket come from tithe income?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea has given &lt;strong&gt;Carl&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.reasonabledissent.com/church-lottery-scam/"&gt;Reasonable Dissent&lt;/a&gt; an idea…:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… I’ve come up with a scam. Here’s how it works: I go to a church official and tell him that I have $1 that I’d like to give to the church, to buy a lottery ticket. The stipulation is that of any winnings, I get 80% and the church gets 20%. Why would I, your committed atheist, want do donate to the church? Because it works out to the favor of both of us…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what if they chose not to spend their winnings on a church but on employee vacations? I really hope the IRS is watching this money carefully because this is absurd. If they didn’t use church tithe income then it wasn’t the church that bought the ticket. And if they did use tithe income to buy the ticket, that is incredibly unethical and the height of hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, since then, there has been no miracles for Focus on the Family, which now is &lt;a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2009/aug/12/colorado-evangelical-group-faces-serious-shortfall/"&gt;suffering a “serious budget shortfall&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awwwww!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t have happened to a more deserving organization. This budget shortfall. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .has prompted the conservative Christian group to issue a special fundraising plea, and contributed to a decision to cede control of its contentious “Love Won Out” conferences about homosexuality to another religious organization, a spokesman said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! For a second there, I thought we wouldn’t have enough conferences for hate groups. Maybe they can work out an arrangement wherein they can share conference space with the Ku Klux Klan and split up the day. In second thought, that could get confusing for attendees who might not be able to figure out which is which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13049629"&gt;By the way, those “Love Won Out” conferences &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13049629"&gt;are all about transforming homosexuals into heterosexuals&lt;/a&gt;, a practice that proven time and time again to not actually work (See: Ted Haggard).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on the Family, founded by child psychologist James Dobson, is on pace to fall $6 million short of a $138 million budget for the fiscal year that began last October, spokesman Gary Schneeberger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, can I get a big AWWWWW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

He has an essay up called &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html"&gt;Why I Think the New Atheists are a [Bloody] Disaster&lt;/a&gt;, in which he bemoans the way he has been abused by these brutal atheists, and explains how he thinks these godless scientists are damaging the cause of science and science education. Here's the heart of his pitiful complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins, in his best selling &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt;, likens me to Neville Chamberlain, the pusillanimous appeaser of Hitler at Munich. Jerry Coyne reviewed one of my books (&lt;i&gt;Can a Darwinian be a Christian?&lt;/i&gt;) using the Orwellian quote that only an intellectual could believe the nonsense I believe in. And non-stop blogger P. Z. Myers has referred to be as a "clueless gobshite." &lt;b&gt;This invective is all because, although I am not a believer, I do not think that all believers are evil or stupid, and because I do not think that science and religion have to clash.&lt;/b&gt; (Of course some science and religion clashes. That is the whole point of the Darwinism-Creationism debate. The matter is whether all science and religion clash, something I deny strongly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true — &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/in_which_andrew_brown_gets_eve.php"&gt;I did call him a clueless gobshite&lt;/a&gt;. However, the reason is most definitely not what I have highlighted in his comment above, and apparently he was not able to read what I wrote for comprehension — perhaps he was &lt;i&gt;stunned&lt;/i&gt; by my invective, and went temporarily blind when he looked at the page, seeing nothing but "clueless gobshite" in 72 point bold blinking text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, what has earned him our ire is his weirdly selective criticisms — the way he consistently leans favorably towards creationism, giving the most charitable interpretations of their motives while gently chiding them for their beliefs, and conversely, trying to turn on flamethrower rhetoric at the atheists (&amp;#39;trying&amp;#39;, I say, because all he can generate anymore is a confused and intermittent sputter), damning them for their bad philosophy and accusing them of being out to demolish science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest essay is a perfect example. Look at what he does here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think first that these people do a disservice to scholarship. Their treatment of the religious viewpoint is pathetic to the point of non-being. Richard Dawkins in &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course. Proudly he criticizes that whereof he knows nothing. As I have said elsewhere, for the first time in my life, I felt sorry for the ontological argument. If we criticized gene theory with as little knowledge as Dawkins has of religion and philosophy, he would be rightly indignant. (He was just this when, thirty years ago, Mary Midgeley went after the selfish gene concept without the slightest knowledge of genetics.) Conversely, I am indignant at the poor quality of the argumentation in Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, and all of the others in that group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think there can be any doubt that he has nothing but contempt for the arguments of the "New Atheists", and he is not at all hesitant to say so. They have not met his standards of philosophical scholarship, and it rouses him to the full fury of an offended academic, one who &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; put these scoundrels in their place. &lt;i&gt;Bad&lt;/i&gt; philosophy is a cardinal sin to Michael Ruse, that is the honest and objective basis for his complaints — it couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be a lingering belief in belief, or perhaps even some professional jealousy, or that for many years he has been in a comfortable back-patting relationship with the creationists in which he politely disputes their claims, after which Ruse and the creationists mutually congratulate each other on their civility and open-mindedness, and he receives his honoraria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it must be our poor reasoning and slovenly philosophy. But then, how do we explain this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, we have seen the rise and growth of a group that the public sphere has labeled the "new atheists" - people who are aggressively pro-science, especially pro-Darwinism, and violently anti-religion of all kinds, especially Christianity but happy to include Islam and the rest. Actually the arguments are not that "new," but no matter - the publicity has been huge. Distinctive of this group, although well known to anyone who studies religion and the way in which sects divide and proliferate, is the fact that (with the possible exception of the Catholic Church) nothing incurs their wrath than those who are pro-science but who refuse to agree that all and every kind of religious belief is wrong, pernicious, and socially and personally dangerous. &lt;b&gt;Recently, it has been the newly appointed director of the NIH, Francis Collins, who has been incurring their hatred. Given the man's scientific and managerial credentials - completing the HGP under budget and under time for a start - this is deplorable, if understandable since Collins is a devout Christian.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait…this makes no sense. He says, &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt; makes me ashamed to be an atheist&amp;quot; — has he read &lt;i&gt;The Language of God&lt;/i&gt;? Has he even tried to wade into the embarrassingly inane philosophy of Collins' BioLogos website? I mean, seriously, if he is such a paragon of intellectual purity that he is furiously offended at Dawkins' work, why is he not also protesting the grade-school foolishness of Collins' arguments? Why, in all these sniping public essays he's been writing these past few years, does he always find excuses to blister the atheists' hides, while making kindly apologies for or ignoring the greater failings of his creationist and religious friends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he consistently predicts woe and doom and disaster because those darned atheists are so wrong and stupid and annoying, while never making the same extravagant lamentations about the effects of institutionalized creationism and religion, which has far more public power and influence. Always, the blame falls on those who challenge most strongly the pernicious effects of faiths that defy reason and science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why he gets called a clueless gobshite and a pusillanimous appeaser and a pusher of nonsense. It has nothing to do with not thinking "that all believers are evil or stupid", because &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; don't think that, and neither do any of these "New Atheists" that I know. In that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/in_which_andrew_brown_gets_eve.php"&gt;essay which gave him conniptions&lt;/a&gt;, I plainly spelled that out, repeatedly and strongly saying that I think most creationists are victims of a con game, and are neither evil nor stupid. I don&amp;#39;t know how he could now quote two words of mine from that post without noting that all the rest of it contradicts his claims about us…except, perhaps, that strange temporary blindness syndrome that fries his occipital lobe at the sight of &amp;quot;clueless gobshite&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also repeatedly pointed out that our opposition to Collins is definitely not because he is a Christian, but it seems to be futile to mention that to these apologists. I guess in a world where Catholic priests can be excused for raping children because they are Christians, it's hopeless to expect that the slighter offense of being an irrational proselytizer with a poor understanding of evolution won't be excused for the same reason, that the poor fool is a Christian. It's an interesting defense; apparently no one will ever be able to criticize a Christian nominee for high office ever again, and the safest strategy for those on that kind of career track is to be the wackiest possible Christian you can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, just look at the rhetoric in his &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt;: at every opportunity, he uses positive language and generous words for his friends the creationists, and the strongest condemnations for prominent atheists; there is absolutely no question where his loyalties lie. At the same time, he levies no blame and holds to no fault the organized liars for Jesus who promote Intelligent Design creationism…while the atheists are taking the country down the road to disaster, disaster, disaster. Could he possibly, at some point in his fading career and diminishing credibility, take a deep, deep breath and notice &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; is snuggling up to lawmakers and sneaking creationism into our school boards, &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; is propagandizing creationism to our teachers, &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; is throwing buckets of money into press releases and ideological conferences (in which Michael Ruse cheerfully participates) that deny science and promote anti-science?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, probably not. He knows he would have no future in a secular world, and his fortunes right now are too strongly tied to his blithe role as the ever-helpful intermediary to the creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more that could be deconstructed in his pathetic whine — &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/michael-ruse-whinges/"&gt;Jerry Coyne rips into his claim that atheism damages education&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not going to accuse Ruse of being a bloody disaster to progress, though, since he has become a trivial irrelevancy and a rather silly figure who takes pride in standing on a bridge between good science and people who believe Jesus created the dinosaurs, reassuring everyone on the crazy side that it's OK to cuddle up to ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I have become so accustomed to the anti-atheist hyperbole that I hadn't even noticed something several commenters have pointed out: Ruse calls the "New Atheists" "violently anti-religion". Violently? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's all I can say about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… a Michigan church is $70,000 richer courtesy of the Michigan Lottery. The Covenant Life Worship Center and its 25 members in Haslett, Mich. had one of the second-prize tickets in the Lucky 7s raffle held May 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… Michigan Lottery officials say the church will receive the full amount of the prize because it is a tax-exempt group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Marilyn Parmelee tells the Lansing State Journal that the prize money will go toward the church building fund, setting up a missionary fund and supporting local community service projects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of where the money is going, but it’s their money, so whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also laugh/gripe about how the church members decided to gamble and how that sounds hypocritical…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But forget all that for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to know how they get out of paying taxes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax-exempt &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; didn’t buy the lottery ticket.  A bunch of people did.  And people are not tax-exempt.  So why are the individuals not paying taxes on their divided winnings?  Even if the money is going to a church, why is it not all after-tax donations?  Why are other winners not using this as an excuse?  Did the money to buy the lottery ticket come from tithe income?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea has given &lt;strong&gt;Carl&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.reasonabledissent.com/church-lottery-scam/"&gt;Reasonable Dissent&lt;/a&gt; an idea…:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I’ve come up with a scam. Here’s how it works: I go to a church official and tell him that I have $1 that I’d like to give to the church, to buy a lottery ticket. The stipulation is that of any winnings, I get 80% and the church gets 20%. Why would I, your committed atheist, want do donate to the church? Because it works out to the favor of both of us…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains more at his site.&lt;/p&gt;

I pointed out the need to study nonbelievers as a group on a larger scale in order to determine if there were any meaningful differences between different subtypes of nonbelievers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who, like me, cannot be there in person, there are plenty of ways to follow the meeting virtually.

In fact, they have &lt;a href="http://binggoestojapan.blogspot.com/2009/08/held-for-ransom-in-japan.html" title=""&gt;threatened to hold him for ransom unless his American friends and family do two things&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Answer questions about Japan/Nippon culture and cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Donate money to help his mother pay the plane fare for his trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's tempting for a young man to stay in Japan, because so far he has found the food to be awesome and the shopping (even in vending machines) to be, let's say, "unique." In fact, the Japanese students think that if he stays long enough he could use his ninja powers to be Emperor someday. I don't think that this would be a good thing for world peace, as Bing has not worked out his "Megalomania" issues and bad things could happen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social networking sites and microblog hosts like Twitter are drawing atheists and agnostics out of seclusion and giving them a platform on which they can discuss and debate their religious beliefs — or lack thereof — with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online buzz surrounding the Creation Museum trip is just one example of how atheists are using the Internet to band together to form a virtual support network, and to provide information about atheism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article features quotations from several familiar names, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alabamaatheist.org/al/"&gt;Blair Scott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://atheistblogger.com/"&gt;Adrian Hayter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an image of the fire, &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=39817&amp;amp;src=share"&gt;from space&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Santa Cruz Sentinel has&lt;a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_13081421"&gt; the best coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Just before boarding a helicopter to take a look at the blaze, [Acting Gov.] Garamendi told the Sentinel he believes the state should work with local officials to identify funding for clearing dangerously dry areas like the Bonny Doon forest where the fire started Wednesday night.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;One thing that makes a lot of sense is to use federal stimulus money to have conservation crews to remove undergrowth and fuel sources near the community,&amp;quot; Garamendi said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Lockheed Fire spread to 4,100 acres overnight, but firefighters have the blaze only 5 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.

&lt;p&gt;What did we learn from all this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, the ads are great for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090814/NEWS/908140354/-1/NEWS04"&gt;helps the advertising companies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since [the Iowa ads went back up], DART has received at least five calls from potential new advertisers, said Kirsten Baer-Harding, DART advertising manager. At least one was from a religious group, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cities there have been counter advertisements to ads like the ones run by the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers, said General Manager Brad Miller.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps the atheist groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Membership in the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers has doubled from what it was before the ad campaign began… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think we got more than we were looking for,” said Lily Kryuchkov, board member with the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers. As of Monday, the group has about 250 members.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we also learned that people who don’t allow for the atheists’ ads to be put up have some &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jHoNPRepOxFqU1b77go-ADxUmoCAD9A2OQI84"&gt;pathetic explanations for their decisions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The issue with the ads in Des Moines was with the word God, said Elizabeth Prusetti, chief development officer for the bus agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have never allowed that word in our advertising, promoting a religion,” she said. “We’ve never used the word God in any advertising to maintain some autonomy. We’ve had churches advertise but it’s been for their church and not a belief.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they won’t advertise God, but they will advertise church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by that logic, DART would’ve been ok with an ad that said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don’t want to go to church?  Don’t bother.  Sleep in and enjoy your life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could’ve told the atheists that and spared them all the trouble…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we learned that we need to keep these kinds of ads going all over the place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reach out to rational people everywhere, and they allow religious groups to make mountains out of molehills, making themselves look foolish in the process.  Win, win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More ads are on their way.  Keep them coming.  Keep the discussions going.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Naked On Roller Skates" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/rebecca.jpg" alt="Naked On Roller Skates" width="218" height="315"&gt;For years, dare I say decades, sex ed classes and conventional wisdom have been teaching us that pulling-out is barely more effective at preventing pregnancy than leaving-in. Turns out, pulling out is the next best thing to actually using a condom! Honest to FSM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guttmacher institute &lt;a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2009/05/15/index.html"&gt;took  a look at the &lt;/a&gt;evidence for the widely held belief that withdrawal is a useless form of contraception. What they found is alarming in light of what we’ve always “known”! Pulling out has a 4% failure rate when used perfectly and 18% failure rate when used imperfectly. I know 18% seems high, but remember that’s only when used not-quite-right… maybe the couple is using it &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time (or just some of the time) or maybe Mr. Loverpantsless doesn’t see any flaws in his “one squirt won’t hurt” policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how it may be used wrong, when compared to condoms, puller-outers hold their own… or, um, don’t. Condoms have a perfect-use failure rate of 2% and an imperfect-use failure rate of 17%, according to the figures in the study. So, comparatively, bareback fares pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="FAM_SIGN-EMERGENCY_EXIT_9X12-6071" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/FAM_SIGN-EMERGENCY_EXIT_9X12-6071.jpg" alt="FAM_SIGN-EMERGENCY_EXIT_9X12-6071" width="149" height="149"&gt;Of course, this doesn’t mean that condoms will become obsolete at the “hands” of those opting for the equally effective, but free luxuries of the last-minute retreat. Condoms are still the only birth control method that stops the spread of disease.  &lt;em&gt;Doingitus interruptus&lt;/em&gt; still puts its users at risk of HIV and other sex juice borne infections. So there’s no need to panic that kids are going to be running around, listening to the rock’n&amp;#39;roll, going all &lt;em&gt;Paradise by the Dashboard Lights&lt;/em&gt; without dashboard insurance since there’s no need for condoms anymore. There is a need, and the need is a huge one. &lt;em&gt;/*That’s what she said.*/&lt;/em&gt; And it still needs to be stressed by parents and sex-educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for those of you who are in long-term, committed, monogamous relationships where the male half can show some restraint, who are looking for a cheap and easy hormone-free form of birth-control or are looking for a temporary fix between birth control methods, you don’t need to worry about a condom budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, if you’re looking for some ideas to add a little spice, check out &lt;a href="http://urbandictionary.com"&gt;urbandictionary.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the largest internet resource of ejaculate maneuvers. Be sure to look up all your favorite super-heroes… unless you’re at work. Seriously, don’t look up anything at urban dictionary while you’re at work… or sober… or feeling especially sentimental about your self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;

At least the Batman sometimes did some good in helping kids get rid of their fear or paranoia of bats.  But while bats might look like silly rats with wings, they are indeed supremely efficient hunting machines.  While some bats eat fruit, a majority of them hunt flying insects in the dark, and eat vast quantities of moths, locusts, flies, mosquitoes and any other bug that flies.  In order to do this efficiently in the dark, they have a fabulously developed system of “echolocation”, a better sonar system than most battleships.  This is great for the bat, and allows them to locate flying insects with pin-point accuracy.  But what about the insects?  Obviously, they have a pressing need to survive and need to escape bats.  Therefore many insects have evolved remarkable ways to evade their hunters.Some insects have developed evasive flying maneuvers, others just taste bad and the bats learn to avoid them, while others yet have evolved a neuronal auditory system that can detect the bat sonar frequency and allow them to escape.  So there is this constant fight between bat and insect in evolving better sonar or ways to evade it.  But, taking a cue from standard defense technology, do any insects actually jam or disrupt bat sonar?  It appears that a certain species of tiger moth can do precisely this.The tiger moth is a perfectly edible snack for the echolocating bat.  But some tiger moths emit specific ultrasonic clicks in the presence of attacking bats.  These clicks could potentially serve as a warning sound, or perhaps be used to startle bats (thus giving the moth time to escape), or perhaps affect the bat sonar.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this phenomenon in a tiger moth species called B. trigona, and used an ingenious test to determine what role these ultrasonic clicks were playing.  They pitted moths against bats in a closed chamber and precisely observed what the bats did.  If the click was a warning sound (for say a poisonous or distasteful insect), the bat would at first attack the insect, but drop it or spit it out, and then learn to avoid the insect.  If it was a startling sound, the bat would at first be startled, but would learn to avoid it.  If the click was indeed a sonar jamming sound, the bats would continue to be confused by the clicking over time.  In their experiments, the researchers used a bunch of juvenile or adult bats and presented them with either the clicking moths, or other moths of the same size that didn’t click, or just a different type of edible, non-clicking moth. What they found was fascinating.  The bats indeed did eat the clicking moths.  However, the bats were 400% more likely to eat a non-clicking moth than the clicking B. trigona.  But what if these clicking moths just tasted worse?  To make sure that this wasn’t the case, the researchers disrupted the clicking mechanisms of these moths, and then let them out with the bats.  This time, the bats hunted them down as well as the other non-clicking moths.  It became very apparent that the moths used the clicking sound in order to disrupt the bat sonar.As far as the moths go, the evolutionary race for survival is pretty simple.  Out in the wild, they don’t need to develop a fantastic sonar jamming device to completely disrupt the bat sonar.  All they need to do to get a huge survival edge is to be able to disrupt the bat echolocator just a little bit (but more than any other insect around), so that they can get away and the other insect gets eaten.  To do this, they only needed to develop a simple tymbal structure, and this structure is now widespread amongst some tiger moth species.  And by doing that, they haven’t evolved to escape all bats, but have just enough to gain that much needed survival edge over other bat prey.(Original reference: Corcoran, A., Barber, J., &amp;amp; Conner, W. (2009). Tiger Moth Jams Bat Sonar Science, 325 (5938), 325-327 DOI: 10.1126/science.1174096)**********This next story is just as fascinating, though more incomplete and raising more questions.  Plants obviously are under constant risk of being eaten by some herbivore or the other.  So some plants have a very effective defense strategy.  They secrete sugars onto their stem or leaves so that they can attract ants.  These ants then stay on the plant, and serve as a nice, natural defense against other plant eating insects or animals.  Butterflies, on the other hand, are insects that plants share a love-hate relationship with.  On one hand, the butterfly pollinates the flowers, allowing the transfer of genetic material from one plant to the other, thus enabling reproduction.  On the other hand, butterflies lay their eggs on plant leaves and the caterpillars then devour the leaves.  And for the butterfly itself, the last place it wants to lay eggs on is a leaf full of predatory ants which would eat up the eggs or caterpillars.But can a butterfly, a mere non-thinking insect, know not to lay eggs on leaves with ants?  The answer, surprisingly, is yes.  In this little paper in The American Naturalist, some researchers devised ingenious experiments to see if butterflies would distinguish between leaves that had ants, or didn’t have ants on them, in order to decide which leaves to lay their eggs on.  In their experiment, the researchers took dead specimens of three species of ants, two of which were predatory (and would eat the eggs/caterpillars) and one of which was a bug of a similar size and shape, but a harmless herbivores.  Then, they pinned these ants on different leaves, and let the butterflies decide where they laid their eggs.  What they saw was surprising, to say the least.  The butterflies not only avoided the leaves with the predatory ants, but also didn’t mind laying eggs on the leaves which had the harmless bug on them.  So it wasn’t as if the butterfly was just laying eggs on leaves with no ants on them, but actually seemed to know that laying eggs on leaves with the herbivorous bug wouldn’t hurt their eggs and so ignored the innocuous bug.  Clearly, it appears that butterflies can use visual clues and decide where to lay their eggs.What is particularly fascinating to me though is not the fact that butterflies can distinguish between predatory and non-predatory ants, but the fact that they know how to do so without any prior “training”.  After all, butterflies are far away from animals or birds which care for their young and potentially teach them about predators or food.  Butterflies aren’t even social insects, to have groups to collectively “learn” from.  So what is the internal wiring they are born with that tells them some ants are dangerous, while others aren’t?  What neuronal and signaling pathways do visual cues of predatory ants activate, while those of innocuous bugs do not? And how does that happen? Do other things, like smell, also influence the butterflies?  There is a whole world of questions out there, waiting to be answered.

However, Voss and Paller seem to have turned this notion on its head. In their study they found that implicit-memory processes can in fact guide responses in an explicit recognition test. Kaleidoscope images were used to either divide or keep intact the human subject&amp;#39;s attention. These same images were then discriminated from visually similar foils during forced-choice recognition testing. They found higher accuracy for images studied with divided attention than for images studied with no attentional diversion. Surprisingly, &amp;quot;guess&amp;quot; responses were even more accurate than &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; responses. Moreover, metamemory was disrupted during the divided attention condition. ERPs of 200-400ms were observed for correct guesses which have been attributed to implicit-memory processing in past studies. The authors suggest that implicit-memory processing to recognition may have been enhanced due to reduced potential for explicit-memory processing. They conclude by stating that their study &amp;quot;provides an unprecedented demonstration of the distinctive nature of overt recognition derived from unconscious memory, a phenomena that we describe as ‘implicit recognition.’&amp;quot;Voss JL, &amp;amp; Paller KA (2009).

I used to be pretty compulsive about digging up old links to my first blog (now in storage) or to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism"&gt;denialism&lt;/a&gt;, or even to this blog, but this can be paralyzing.  I still try to make sure to link to other writer's pieces, whether on denialism blog, or at other blogs that I like, but if I were to be overly compulsive about this, I'd never get any writing done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that in mind, it's time for a review of alternative medicine (one that is a bit more extensive than &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/01/alternative_medicine---back_to.php"&gt;my last similar diatribe&lt;/a&gt;).  I get a lot of questions, mostly of the "DrPal, why are you such a hater?" variety.  I'm not a hater.  I'm a stickler.  My ethics require me to do the best for my patients, which includes treating them with respect.  Respecting my patients requires telling them the truth about various interventions---does the evidence support them, and if so, how well?  This week, for example, I was going over a medication list with a patient and asked him why he took mega-doses of vitamin C.  He said to prevent colds, cancer, and because it seemed like a good idea.  I informed him that multiple well-done studies have failed to show significant benefit to taking vitamin C supplements, and he agreed to stop them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/"&gt;what's the harm?&lt;/a&gt;  There may be none in this case (although &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/take_vitamins---its_magic.php"&gt;the same can't be said for vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;).  But there's lots of reasons to guide patients toward science-based therapies, not the least of which is your ethical responsibility.  I have many patients who complain of taking "too many pills".  Sometimes they are, and sometimes it's a doctor's fault, sometimes not.  If I have a patient with hypertension and diabetes, the evidence clearly shows that certain interventions, including lifestyle modification and medications, will save them a lot of grief.  But a patient may also be on a host of non-proven supplements, which, if dropped, would make the patient seem much less "over-medicated".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is one of those weird false dichotomies.  Patients sometimes want to take something "natural" rather than a "medicine" (as long as natural doesn't mean eating better and exercising more).  If something is physiologically active enough to affect a disease state, it doesn't much matter whether it's "natural" or not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let's throw some organization on this post before it gets &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; out of hand.&lt;br&gt;

In vivo tractography is achieved using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which is sensitive to the direction (orientation) of water molecule diffusion.  Because water diffuses more readily along myelinated fiber tracts DTI can be used to map white matter fiber projections.  Like fMRI, DTI findings are highly dependent on the details of how the data are analyzed, e.g., how the seeds are selected, whether you average across subjects or not, etc. So, like fMRI I think any individual study needs to be interpreted cautiously until similar patterns start showing up across studies/labs/methods. I recently looked at four published studies to see if there were any patterns that emerged.  The figure below is my summary of what these studies showed.  All of them distinguished between anterior and posterior sectors of Broca&amp;#39;s area, the pars triangularis (PTr, ~BA45) and pars opercularis (PO, ~BA44), and two studies distinguished a third region referred to as the deep frontal operculum (DFO).  It is not yet clear to me where this DFO is exactly; more on that later.  Two of the studies differentiated temporal lobe regions into a dorsal site, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and a more ventral site, the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). There is clear evidence for two pathways, a dorsal pathway corresponding to the classic arcuate fasciculus link between Broca&amp;#39;s and Wernicke&amp;#39;s areas, and a ventral pathway that projects through the anterior temporal lobe and into the inferior frontal gyrus via the uncinate fasciculus and/or the extreme capsule. The figure below shows the dominant connections reported in each study. Lines are color coded by study so that where there are more lines between two regions we can have more confidence that the connection exists (i.e., it replicated across more studies).  For studies that didn&amp;#39;t report a specific temporal lobe target, the lines to the temporal regions are left undetermined in the figure.  There is clear evidence for a link between the STG and PO, the posterior portion of Broca&amp;#39;s area.  This makes some sense as both the STG and PO have been implicated in phonological-level processing. This link appears to be via the dorsal route.  One study found that this relation may be mediated by a region in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL).  It is tempting to think this may be Spt, but it is only one study, and this study did not specify the specific temporal lobe target.  The pars triangularis has a different connectivity pattern.  It has projections via both the dorsal and ventral route and where specified, it connects to the MTG.  This also makes some sense as both the PTr and the MTG have been implicated in aspects of higher-level (e.g., &amp;quot;semantic&amp;quot;) processing.  The deep frontal operculum appears to connect with the temporal lobe primarily via the ventral route.  Some have suggested that the DFO plays a role in syntactic processes.  I&amp;#39;m not so sure about this yet, but it is interesting that it projects through the anterior temporal region which also seems to supports some aspect of sentence-level processing. So what we seem to have is a hierarchical connection pattern between the temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe.  Temporal lobe regions that are closer to the auditory periphery connect with IFG regions that (may be) closer to the motor periphery (the STG-PO circuit), whereas temporal lobe regions that are doing some higher-order operations connect with higher-order IFG regions (the MTG-PTr circuit).  I think connectivity studies are crucially important in helping to constrain theories of language organization.  While tractography research is still in its infancy, this set of studies strikes me as a really great start.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what the recent miracle is that’s been attributed to the intercession or divine intervention of Kateri Tekakwitha, known as the Lily of the Mohawks, remains a closely guarded secret.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably never heard of Tekawitha, whose when-alive hobbies &lt;a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14471a.htm"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; virginity, being really short, starving herself, and lying on a bed of thorns.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, she must be pretty popular within the church, as they proactively assigned her a miracle finder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence of the miracle — which took two years to compile — was sent to Rome last month in a diplomatic pouch through the Vatican embassy in Washington, D.C., said Monsignor Paul Lenz, the church official who was charged with finding a miracle that could qualify Kateri for sainthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, I researched the qualifications to become a miracle finder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Position Description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Finder guides and manages the overall miracle location process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miracle Finder is responsible for all or part of these areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Ignoring science.
&lt;li&gt; Devising supernatural explanations for natural events.
&lt;li&gt; Ignoring science.
&lt;li&gt; Superstition.
&lt;li&gt; Burning candles with pictures of saints and Spanish-language prayers on the sides.
&lt;li&gt; Finding miracles.
&lt;li&gt; Ignoring science.
&lt;li&gt; Some light cleaning.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Education and Experience&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Maximum of a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent in Theology, Education, Human Resources, or some other non-scientific field.
&lt;li&gt; Demonstrated expertise in ignoring laws of statistics and probability.
&lt;li&gt; Accomplished Miracle Finder (&lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=amf"&gt;AMF&lt;/a&gt;) certification preferred, not required.
&lt;li&gt; Credulous nature a MUST.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compensation&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Hamill, "The Unconscious Life"&lt;/b&gt;: A track from an amazing live
  performance. In general, I'm not a big fan of live recordings - you really need
  to &lt;em&gt;be there&lt;/em&gt; for a live performance. There's a dynamic between the performer
  and the audience in live music, and in a recording, you're listening to it from
  the outside - so you can feel that there's something missing. This recording has an
  intensity, an intimacy, which is extraordinary. And it's a great song, too.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valley of the Giants, "Whaling Tale"&lt;/b&gt;: Valley of the Giants has taken its
  place as my favorite post-rock band - surpassing even "Godspeed You Black Emperor!".
  This track is very godspeed-like, but it manages to carry it out better than
  even Godspeed would have.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black Math Horseman, "Deerslayer"&lt;/b&gt;: This is a hard group to describe. 
    It's sort of like a cross between Mogwai, Sonic Youth, and King Crimson. They're not really post-rock, and they're not really prog rock, but they've got elements of both. They've got a really great sound. I haven't listened to them enough to get a really
  good feel, but they're definitely worth a listen.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "The Rainmaker"&lt;/b&gt;: What can I say about the Flower Kings
    that I haven't said before?&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "The Only Unforgivable Thing"&lt;/b&gt;: a vaguely poppy track from
   Marillion's second-best album. It's slow, with the feel and structure
   of a pop ballad, but the lyrics are very un-ballad-like, and it's got a ton
   of subtle complexity. Classic Marillion.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riverside, "Cybernetic Pillow"&lt;/b&gt;: I'm pretty sure I've mentioned
   Riverside before. They're a really fantastic neo-progressive band from
   Poland that I discovered lately. They're really remarkable - they've got
   an amazing sound, which is very distinct from anything else. Most neo-prog
   bands, you can listen to, and say their main inspiration is Genesis, or Yes,
   or Pink Floyd, or whatever. With Riverside, I can't do that. They sound like
   themselves, and nothing else. I've embedded a Youtube live video of this
   song below.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gong, "Damaged Man"&lt;/b&gt;: A very typical Gong track, if there is such a thing.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Porcupine Tree, "Sentimental"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rush, "Red Lenses"&lt;/b&gt;: a nice old classic Rush track.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Reasoning, "Shadows of the Mind"&lt;/b&gt;: another recent discovery for me;
   The Reasoning is a decent neo-prog band. They're not great, but they're good,
   and they do some terrific multipart vocal harmony.&lt;/li&gt;

It’s the Sylvia Browne zombie-monster and she’s holding Montel Williams hostage! Aaaaaaaagggghhhhh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute; does that mean &lt;a href="http://stopsylvia.com/home/"&gt;Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt; was not telling the truth &lt;img src="http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/1208/silviaandmontels.jpg" alt="Sylvia and Montel Zombie Monsters" width="280" height="335"&gt;when she said 2008 was her farewell lecture tour? Oh, what she meant to say was that 2009 is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; her farewell tour.  I get it, it’s an extension of her 2008 farewell tour! Yeah, that must be it. But doesn’t that mean she couldn’t even predict how long her tour would last? Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(More on  Zombie Sylvia after the fold)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://skepchick.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;Of course, it doesn’t ever really matter what she says because we all know that everything she spews out of that gravel-laced pit of a mouth is complete crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit I had high hopes that it would at least be the end of the Montel Williams’ promotion of her atrocious lies when his talk show was canceled, but unfortunately that wasn’t true either. This week, those on a special email list got the inside scoop on presale tickets available for a Sylvia Browne and Montel Williams together-again “spoken word/variety show” at the Gibson Amphitheatre at Universal City Walk in Los Angeles on Saturday October 3rd. For $47.50 -$77.50 you too can hear the hideous, raspy voiced, claimed psychic say things like, “The kid’s dead! The kid’s dead!” Or, “You can’t find him cuz he’s in water.” Of course Montel will be right by her side nodding in agreement. It did say “spoken word/variety” show so maybe he will be doing a little dance by her side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me had thought that maybe he only had her on his talk show for the ratings and had been pressured by the network to do so, but it actually looks like he has been a true believer and supporter all along. No real shock there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also noticed after checking out her website that she is promoting and advertising one of those businesses where you send in your old gold and silver jewelry to melt down. She just gets tackier by the minute, sort of like Ben Stein with his not-really-free free credit report bullshit. If that doesn’t creep you out, how about the fact that she’s offering you the opportunity to become a professional hypnotherapist by taking part in her “Hypnosis Certification Training Course” October 12th-18th? Tuition is a mere $2,000! (You can raise the funds by selling your gold to her.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info on Sylvia Brownes tour dates, go to her website. Or better yet, forget everything you know about reality, throw your money out the window, ignore your family and slip into depression. You get the same results and you don’t have to leave your home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Amy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250284504592"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-8867115379649847560">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/76478808daceb311</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">For All Time</title><published>2009-08-14T17:48:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-17T18:52:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/gZ3D3P1XeKM/for-all-time.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/8867115379649847560/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/08/for-all-time.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/08/for-all-time.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SoWlyVmfnlI/AAAAAAAAAEo/Nj692-UgU-c/s1600-h/5063504.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:320px;height:256px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SoWlyVmfnlI/AAAAAAAAAEo/Nj692-UgU-c/s320/5063504.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The film adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's bestselling novel, &lt;i&gt;The Time Traveler's Wife&lt;/i&gt;, hits theaters this weekend. For those unfamiliar with the premise, it concerns a Chicago librarian named Harry (Eric Bana) who suffers from a rare genetic disorder that causes him to live on a constantly shifting timeline, shuttling back and forth between past, present and future with no control over this unusual quirk. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This understandably throws a wrench into his relationship with Clare (Rachel McAdams), who must cope with his sudden disappearances and re-appearances as best she can over the course of their marriage.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let's leave aside the fact that no genetic disorder could possibly cause this kind of anomaly in the space-time continuum. We're talking about fantasy, after all, which demands a certain willing suspension of disbelief. That said, according to Drexel University physicist Dave Goldberg, the time travel science in the film is surprisingly consistent with what physicists have to say about how time travel should work, were it possible. He's written &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2225223"&gt;a fun analysis&lt;/a&gt; on this topic for &lt;i&gt;Slate&lt;/i&gt;, in honor of the movie's release (as well as a forthcoming book with Jeff Blomquist, &lt;i&gt;A User's Guide to the Universe: the Perils of Black Holes, Time Paradoxes and Quantum Uncertainty&lt;/i&gt;, due in March 2010). An excerpt:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a rule-abiding time travel narrative, there are no parallel universes -- just a single timeline. &lt;b&gt;The Time Traveler's Wife&lt;/b&gt; follows this rule to a T, and there is a significant online presence dedicated to diagramming the unique entangled history of Henry and Clare."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, a fictional world can set its own rules, and need only be internally self-consistent. But it's nice that at least one physicist out there appreciates that &lt;i&gt;The Time Traveler's Wife&lt;/i&gt; gets it mostly right. You can read more about the rules of time travel &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/05/14/rules-for-time-travelers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/twisted_physics/2009/06/no-fate-but-what-we-make.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so when you get to the theater to see the film, you can appreciate even more fully the cinematic vision on the screen.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/gu8lYr0kf7g%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-8867115379649847560?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It is now corrected, and the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/molly.php"&gt;latest Molly Awards for June&lt;/a&gt; are now online. My apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two winners this month. The first is &lt;b&gt;Jadehawk&lt;/b&gt;, and it's about time. You guys have been throwing votes her way for so long, and at last they reached critical mass. The second winner is a bit troubling. You voted for a &lt;i&gt;fundamentalist Christian&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; blog, and I almost decided to void that vote right there. But then I realized that winning the acclaim of the Pharyngulistas means he is definitely going to hell now, so I decided to allow the election of &lt;b&gt;Smoggy Batzrubble&lt;/b&gt; to stand. Floyd Rubber is going to have to give him a thorough flagellation and purification this weekend, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know July is long gone, so you&amp;#39;re going to have to stretch your memories a bit — but you&amp;#39;re clever, you can do it. Leave your votes in the comments for the commenter most deserving the Molly Award for July 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_forgot_all_about_molly.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0iCPxUGGkdc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250283672133"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/todays_carnivals_412.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d780881716a80e35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-08-14T19:02:09Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T19:02:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/JCFoHRwa2Gw/todays_carnivals_412.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/todays_carnivals_412.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skeptics Circle&lt;/strong&gt; #117 is up on &lt;a href="http://ionian-enchantment.blogspot.com/2009/08/skeptics-circle-117-chiropractic.html" title=""&gt;Ionian Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, they decided to do it and said I had to join them or else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dance is now choreographed.  It includes some Michael Jackson moves, the Macarena, and a Charlie’s Angels pose among regular Bollywood-ish moves.  We’ll perform it in a few weeks.  In full Indian garb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told I must put the performance on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1979, the Shiite revolution in Iran was in full swing. The Shah had fled, Ayatollah Khomeini had returned, and summary executions had begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often the only notice that a person is on trial is the announcement on the morning radio news that he has been executed. The front pages of the afternoon Persian-language newspapers are filled with grisly pictures of the bodies. (&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, April 11, 1979)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full extent to which Iran would become a theocracy was still not entirely clear. On February 4th, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;‘ R.W. Apple had asked “Will Khomeini turn Iran’s clock back 1,300 years”, and the short answer turned out to be “yes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an undergraduate in the department of Ecology and Evolution at the State University of New York at Stony Brook at the time, and often had lunch with a group of faculty and grad students in a cafeteria across the street from the biology building. At one of these lunches, during a discussion of events in Iran, a young assistant professor commented, “If this doesn’t give religion a bad name, nothing will.”  And for a long time, I thought nothing would. The following year marked the ascent of Ronald Reagan, and the beginning of  the agonizing descent of the Republican party from being the party of Lincoln to the party of Limbaugh, Beck, Robertson, Inhofe, and the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/opinion/18collins.ready.html?scp=3&amp;amp;sq=sharlet&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recalled this lunch time comment while thinking about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/the_future_belongs_to_the_darw.php"&gt;Razib’s post&lt;/a&gt; on the greater acceptance of evolution among younger cohorts of Americans. I also recalled that the percentage of &lt;a href="http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/reports/highlights.html"&gt;religiously unaffiliated had gone up&lt;/a&gt; noticeably from 1990 to 2008, and that another survey found the percentage was &lt;a href="http://brian.carnell.com/articles/2009/pew-poll-25-percent-of-18-29-year-olds-identify-as-atheist-agnostic-no-religion"&gt;higher among young people&lt;/a&gt;. What could have happened so that younger people, growing up in the 90s and 00s, would be less religious? And then it occurred to me: 9/11.  Something finally happened which gave religion a bad name.  This was forcefully expressed at the time (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/15/september11.politicsphilosophyandsociety1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/timely/dawkins.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/11/afghanistan.terrorism2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) by Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there may well be other or better explanations for these survey results (indeed, several alternatives have been proposed regarding acceptance of evolution in comments here at WEIT and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/"&gt;GNXP&lt;/a&gt;, which alternatives might be tested with GSS data); and, clearly, religious believers can accept evolution (witness the young Catholic poll results).   But 9/11, while not giving religion a bad enough name for most people to give it up, may have led people to question on what grounds religious claims are to be evaluated, and what entitles them to respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE.&lt;/strong&gt; Razib has done exactly what I had hoped: he’s&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/did_911_give_religion_a_bad_na.php#more"&gt; tested my suggestion by looking at survey data&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2009/08/did-911-give-religion-a-bad-name-probably-not/"&gt;updated link to Razib's new blog host&lt;/a&gt;] (26 surveys from 1973 to 2008). While not a decisive refutation of my suggestion, there’s not much support for it. Secularization increases from 1993 to 2008. The biggest increases occur from 1991 to 1998, with something of a plateau from 1998 to 2004, then there’s another bit of a jump from 2004 to 2006. It might be safest just to say that it increased from ’93 to ’08, and not try to interpret what may well be random variation around that rise. I would say the evidence for a lagged post 9/11 jump is modest at best, and most of the increase occurred pre -2001, so 9/11 is at most a lesser contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;

DenCol has been &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/05/for-those-who-might-think-i-banned.html"&gt;banned as an ignorant abusive troll&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not exactly sure why he's here or what he actually believes, but for the most part he does not try to interact with us at DC. Once banned he starts another Blogger account and this process starts all over again. He has been banned as Rob, savedbygrace, tyler, Richard2, Rich386 and others. Right now he's commenting as Cool Running. He does not respect our wishes to go away and so he apparently does not think the Golden Rule should be followed when it comes to skeptics (Isn't that scary? What other moral duties does he not have to obey when it comes to us?). But this process sometimes takes a while before we can identify him. So there are a lot of comments to delete along with the responses to him (if I were to begin doing that). Nonetheless, it's beginning to look to the first time visitor as if we are banning a whole lot of people. &lt;strong&gt;It's just one person!&lt;/strong&gt; Fair warning to everyone. If you engage this troll you will be frustrated. I recomend just ignoring him. Or you can email him at &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dencollis@juno.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

Today, we’re going to talk about gender issues in the skeptical movement… KIDDING! &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really, don’t talk about that stuff – I have to moderate this thread and I have plans tonight &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, a big thanks to Chelsea for covering for me the past couple of weeks. Last week, I started a new job so I’ve been a little buried. After 11 years at my previous position, it has been a HUGE change for me.  So far, I’m loving it. It’s not my dream job, because that would involve something to do with skepticism full time.  But it’s close. It’s a small company, I’m working for someone I’ve worked with before who I really like and respect and although I’m overwhelmed, I’m learning new stuff every day. So I’m pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on this Friday afternoon, I ask you, dear reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your dream job? What would you love to be doing 8-10 hours a day? Are you doing it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanna hunt for supernovae? Here’s your chance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://supernova.galaxyzoo.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/galaxyzoo_sn.gif" alt="Supernova hunt at Galaxyzoo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks at Galaxy Zoo — the enormously successful and highly addictive citizen’s science site that lets you classify galaxies — have added a new twist: &lt;a href="http://supernova.galaxyzoo.org"&gt;the ability to look for supernovae in their images&lt;/a&gt;. When a star blows up, it gets much brighter. So by taking the new Galaxy Zoo images and comparing them to older images, it’s possible to find a supernova. The two images need to be aligned, then scaled, then subtracted… and if there’s still something there, it may be a star that did not go gently into that good night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make it easy on you: they’ve done all the hard processing work, and present the results. The picture above is from the hunt. You look at it, answer some simple questions, and then move on to the next one. It’s not hard… except stopping. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this works (and I think it will), I wonder what’s next for the clever brains behind Galaxy Zoo. Asteroid searches? Kuiper Belt Objects? There’s a lot of potential in them thar images, and I expect we’ll be seeing a lot more of it realized.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250277260806"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/burning_stupid_and_hypocrisy.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e90aefb07d1d89ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Burning stupid and hypocrisy</title><published>2009-08-14T17:52:48Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T17:52:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/3-Vu1h9iNL4/burning_stupid_and_hypocrisy.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/burning_stupid_and_hypocrisy.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;No comment other than I'm not surprised at the hypocrisy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you’re all just as excited as me that this is the day I reveal the Comment o’ the Week, so I’ll just dive right in. This week’s winner was a tough choice because so many of you nominated your fellow commenters, but finally I decided to give the award to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8803&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-73870"&gt;SKrap for this excellent use of poetry&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oompa-Loompa cove should be used to house the creationism exhibit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Doo&lt;br&gt;
God is watching everything you do.&lt;br&gt;
Oompa Loompa Trompety Turn&lt;br&gt;
You’d best believe or You’re going to burn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do you blame when your kid reads a book&lt;br&gt;
Science can’t hurt him he’ll just take a look&lt;br&gt;
Its all your fault when he wants things explained&lt;br&gt;
It was your job to hollow out his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the last line that really does it for me. Good job, SKrap! Your prize is to choose next Wednesday’s Afternoon Inquisition, which you can send in using &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;the contact form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you (and everyone else) can get your own avatar by heading to Gravatar.com and uploading a picture and associating it with whatever email address you used to sign up here on Skepchick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, there are about a dozen COTW runners-up over on Elyse’s post &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8816"&gt;H1N1, Sodomy, Autoerotica and You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Go read them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, anyone can nominate next week’s COTW: just click the arrow by their comment to reply to them, and write “COTW!”&lt;/p&gt;

You’re an outstanding performer, considered one of the best in the firm. A couple offices down from you is a guy named Wendel, and you feel sorry for Wendel because he’s not quite able to meet the performance standards and is always teetering on the edge of losing his job. Your sense of Wendel is that he’s a good guy who just never gets the right breaks, and if he were given more chances to succeed he could probably pull himself out of his slump.

One day, you’re working on a project team with Wendel and notice that he’s screwed up a major report bigtime—big enough that he’s sure to get fired if anyone else sees it—but so far only you have seen it and you have a brief opportunity to cover up Wendel’s mistakes. If you cover them up, in effect lying by passing off your work as Wendel’s, you’ll probably get away with it and Wendel will go on to work another day. If you don’t, he’s finished. 

What will you do?

K said that Santa Claus wasn’t real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a big deal or anything at the time, but she worries about what would’ve happened if other parents were around, heard it, and complained.  What if their children were present?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My husband and I are not yet parents, but we have discussed many points of parenting, the first point being that we will not lie to our children.  To us, upholding the fairy tale that Santa Claus exists would be the same as supporting the Jesus myth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/12/15/how-much-santa-is-too-much/"&gt;how to handle the Santa situation&lt;/a&gt; here before, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do you say if &lt;em&gt;other peoples’ children&lt;/em&gt; ask you about Santa Claus?  Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you tell them your personal views (in a diplomatic way)?  Do you tell them to ask their own parents?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . Secondly, I think that the new atheists are doing terrible political damage to the cause of Creationism fighting. Americans are religious people. You may not like this fact. But they are. Not all are fanatics. Survey after survey shows that most American Christians (and Jews and others) fall in the middle on social issues like abortion and gay marriage as well as on science. They want to be science-friendly, although it is certainly true that many have been seduced by the Creationists. We evolutionists have got to speak to these people. We have got to show them that Darwinism is their friend not their enemy. We have got to get them onside when it comes to science in the classroom. And criticizing good men like Francis Collins, accusing them of fanaticism, is just not going to do the job. Nor is criticizing everyone, like me, who wants to build a bridge to believers – not accepting the beliefs, but willing to respect someone who does have them. For myself, I would like America to have a healthcare system like Canada – government run, compulsory, universal. It is cheaper and better. But I engage with those who want free enterprise to be involved in the business. Likewise I engage with believers – I don’t accept their beliefs but I respect their right to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the new atheists are doing terrible damage to the fight to keep Creationism out of the schools. The First Amendment does not ban the teaching of bad science in publicly funded schools. It bans the teaching of religion. That is why it is crucial to argue that Creationism, including its side kick IDT, is religion and not just bad science. But sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If teaching “God exists” is teaching religion – and it is – then why is teaching “God does not exist” not teaching religion? Obviously it is teaching religion. But if science generally and Darwinism specifically imply that God does not exist, then teaching science generally and Darwinism specifically runs smack up against the First Amendment. Perhaps indeed teaching Darwinism is implicitly teaching atheism. This is the claim of the new atheists. If this is so, then we shall have to live with it and rethink our strategy about Creationism and the schools. The point is however that the new atheists have lamentably failed to prove their point, and excoriating people like me who show the failure is (again) not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that P. Z. Myers and his crew are as disastrous to the evolution side – and people like me need to say this – as Ben Stein is disastrous to the Creationism side – and the Creationists should have had the guts to say so. I have written elsewhere that &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; makes me ashamed to be an atheist. Let me say that again. Let me say also that I am proud to be the focus of the invective of the new atheists. They are a disaster and I want to be on the front line of those who say so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the immortal words of Clara Peller, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_the_beef%3F"&gt;“Where’s the beef?”&lt;/a&gt; Where is the evidence that vocal atheists are setting back the cause of evolution? This is only an &lt;em&gt;opinion&lt;/em&gt;, and no better than the opinion that by pushing back the influence of religion, the new atheists are actually &lt;em&gt;promoting&lt;/em&gt; the acceptance of evolution. I agree with P.Z. Myers that we should “let a thousand critics blossom,” with each of us supporting evolution in the way we know best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ruse, who seems to pride himself on his sophisticated knowledge of theology, runs completely aground when he equates teaching Darwinism with teaching atheism.  I don’t know of a single evolutionist who teaches atheism in their classrooms, or who even says in the classroom that Darwinism is tantamount to atheism. Show me, Dr. Ruse, &lt;em&gt;one atheist&lt;/em&gt; who violates freedom of religion by saying, “God does not exist” in the public school (or even the university) classroom.   Yes, teaching evolution may have the side result of eroding some peoples’ faith, but, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/06/20/andrew-brown-makes-another-dumb-argument-for-accommodationism/"&gt;as I’ve pointed out before&lt;/a&gt;, the erosion of faith can occur in the geology classroom, the astronomy classroom, the ethics classroom, and even in the theology classroom! (How many believers have lost their faith when learning about how the Bible was actually put together?) As the respect for rational discourse increases, as it should with a good education, the respect for religion will erode.  But that doesn’t mean that a good education violates the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind all this, I think, is Ruse’s anger at having been attacked by atheists, something he makes pretty clear in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a devout Christian, yet if anything, the things said against me are worse.  Richard Dawkins, in his best selling &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;, likens me to Neville Chamberlain, the pusillanimous appeaser of Hitler at Munich.  &lt;a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n09/coyn01_.html"&gt;Jerry Coyne reviewed one of my books&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Can a Darwinian be a Christian?&lt;/em&gt;) using the Orwellian quote that only an intellectual could believe the nonsense I believe in. And non-stop blogger P. Z. Myers has referred to be as a “clueless gobshite.” This invective is all because, although I am not a believer, I do not think that all believers are evil or stupid, and because I do not think that science and religion have to clash. (Of course some science and religion clashes. That is the whole point of the Darwinism-Creationism debate. The matter is whether all science and religion clash, something I deny strongly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Ruse also goes after Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, and other new atheists for their lame and unsophisticated arguments against religion.  This is again standard fare, but if there’s a better theological argument for the existence of God than has been criticized by these people, I don’t know it.  For someone who touts his sophistication in theology and philosophy, Ruse shows himself appallingly dense about the relationship between teaching evolution, teaching atheism, and the First Amendment.  And it’s sad that a philosopher with any pretension to intellectual rigor must consort with the mushbrained BioLogos Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;NOTE:  As the evisceration of Ruse proceeds at the &lt;em&gt;Science and the Sacred&lt;/em&gt; website as well as at &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4168,Why-I-Think-the-New-Atheists-are-a-Disaster,Michael-Ruse---beliefnet"&gt;RichardDawkins.net&lt;/a&gt;, I want to highlight one comment made by “Mr. Forrest” (comment 45 on the Dawkins.net thread), especially the part in bold (my emphasis).  As Mr. Forrest notes, the &lt;a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg/"&gt;ontological argument&lt;/a&gt;, which Ruse sees as badly treated by Dawkins, is just plain stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Holy crap… the ontological argument is the one that goes approximately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I can imagine a perfect God&lt;br&gt;
2. One of the attributes of perfection is existence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore:&lt;br&gt;
God exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just vaguely remeber this one from religious studies. Apart from being WILDLY idiosyncratic AND a logical and empirical train-wreck, I would like to challenge the theists to come up with a specific morally perfect god and have them answer a couple of moral dillemas. Then we’ll see how “perfect” their god is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and the article was fucking awful. I think its insulting in the extreme to presume that people are incapable of having a discussion in frank terms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Calling the new atheists violent or strident serves EXACTLY the same function as calling an african-american “uppity”. We’re standing up for our views and being really insanely polite about it considering the effects of religion. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we really need million man marches, riots, decades of civil rights activism etc. to be granted the right to speak our minds?&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Lorry&lt;/strong&gt;’s daughter never needs another pair of clothing.  Just wear this nonstop and all will be right with the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_2184.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_2184.jpg" alt="IMG_2184" title="CostumeBaby" width="500" height="646"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This costume worked for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/"&gt;BlagHag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Jen as a child, and I will petition for a revival this Halloween:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know reader &lt;strong&gt;Tony&lt;/strong&gt;’s daughter, but she is now the posterchild for what I will do with my child one day.  Look at her.  She loves it!:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dangeroustalk.net/"&gt;Staks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; took his son to the Wizard World Philly Comic Convention a couple months ago and dressed him up Jedi-style.  The child better enjoy it.  I suspect this is the only time in his life when dressing up as a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; character will attract 3099023 ladies &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Jeff&lt;/strong&gt; wins the prize for best baby costume, though.  He and his wife joined in on the fun — that’s what I call family unity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earl Grey is basically Assam flavoured with oil of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange"&gt;bergamot&lt;/a&gt;, a citrus fruit. It's OK if there's no plain tea. But many café employees believe that Earl Grey &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; plain tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I drink &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeybush"&gt;honeybush&lt;/a&gt; which is kind of nice, but that's another plant and nothing compared to real tea. I don't like rooibos much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my favourite teas.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assam CTC. This is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crush,_Tear,_Curl"&gt;Crushed, Torn and Curled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Assamica&lt;/i&gt;. Dark, strong, the main ingredient in "English breakfast".&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan_tea"&gt;Yunnan&lt;/a&gt; (Swedes, this is pronounced "jynnän"; Anglophones, you will never learn to pronounce that first vowel) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keemun_tea"&gt;Keemun&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese black teas with a hint of woodsmoke, like delicate versions of the outrageous Lapsang souchong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_(tea)"&gt;tea dust&lt;/a&gt;. This is actually considered low-budget stuff, but it makes for a strong brew which is what I mainly care about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't like these:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oolong and Darjeeling. Sour-tasting.&lt;li&gt;Ceylon. Weak unsatisfying stuff.

&lt;p&gt;He  is an aerospace engineering professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY  specializing in directed energy applications, aerospace systems,  and advanced propulsion. Those are some cool specialties aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrabo envisions a future for non-chemical propulsion and I hope he’s right because chemical rockets are just too expensive, inefficient, and even a tad retro for my forward-thinking tastes.  If we can’t have jetpacks or flying cars in 2009, let’s at least have some really wicked rocket technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately he’s not peddling Nuclear rocket engines which I think are no-brainers. His ideas, though not new, certainly have a lot of the gee-whiz holy-crap factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="laser propulsion" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/laserpropulsion1.jpg" alt="laser propulsion" width="364" height="292"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrabo has been working for 30 years on what’s called laser propulsion. This concept was first introduced by &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Arthur-Kantrowitz---Father-of-Laser-Propulsion&amp;amp;id=2397301"&gt;Arthur Kantrowitz&lt;/a&gt; in 1972. If you’re not familiar with it, it is a form of beam-powered propulsion in which the source of energy is separate from the reaction mass. For chemical rockets, both of these are on board in terms of liquid or solid fuel and the mass of the rocket itself. Laser propulsion removes the fuel from the craft by using  a ground-based laser or maser that is directed towards the funnel-shaped underside of the craft. Inside is a parabolic reflector which focuses the light to a point heating the air to a steamy 30,000 degrees. I don’t know if that Celsius or Farenheit but it doesn’t really matter cause that’s damn hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes the surrounding air to explode generating  upward thrust for the rocket. Small nitrogen jets also spin the craft at 6000 rpm so it stays stable. That’s a boat-load of rpms. I wonder how difficult it would be to isolate any crew from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is this guy so gung-ho about this now? It’s not just that he’s devoted decades to this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrabo told SPACE.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, a new propulsion technology takes 25 years to mature…to the point where you can actually field it. Well, that time is now,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, one of the big milestones for this technology is a drop in cost to just a couple of US dollars per watt of laser energy. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re here now. It’s a matter of will and do we want to do it. This technology is now at the cusp of commercial reality…All that’s needed now is to actually build them. The problem has evolved from a scientific one to an engineering one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what might we see if his prognostications are correct?&lt;br&gt;
Initially we could see this tech used for launching nano and micro-satellites. These range from 1 to 100 kilograms. He says we could potentially see a thousand-fold reduction in cost per pound to put stuff in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the line we may see wholesale replacement of commercial jet travel. People could potentially be flown to the other side of the planet in under an hour. I wonder if this will be ready for our Australia trip next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myrabo also talks of power stations in space beaming down energy to electrically propel cars and trains and even for heating and cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do the skeptics say? Well you know how cynical and close-minded they can be. &lt;img src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Coyle is a former top technology tester for the Pentagon. He &lt;a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-02/20/laser-powered-aircraft-could-outrun-concorde.aspx"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Wired.com last year that researchers have been trying with little success to scale this technology for years. He says the major limitations are the power of the lasers, the size of the craft, and the limited propellants they carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The propellant runs out before the LightCraft gets very far. It’s sort of like trying to blow a paper airplane across the room with you own breath. You can give it a push with your first puff, but then the paper airplane is too far away and you can’t blow enough air to keep it going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering about his mention of propellant, I believe he’s referring to onboard propellant to be used once the atmosphere is too thin or once the craft is in space. This is a definite limitation but a laser boost to the stratosphere would still make for a nice first stage and save a lot of money. The power of the laser is a limitation now but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that tera-watt or even peta-watt lasers could be used for this application in the future even if they’re fairly inefficient. The size of the craft may always be a limitation but there’s nothing stopping you from sending many small crafts into orbit and then having them link up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people were also saying that 30,000 degrees is too hot for the craft.  This is one of those problems  that any competent engineer would resolve way back when they were in the back-of-the-envelope stage of research. As far as I can tell, the hot-spot is away from the structure and the wind whipping around the craft would also carry away a lot of the heat I would think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far removed are they from the back of that envelope? According to Myrabo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom:0.0001pt"&gt;“In the lab we’re doing full-size engine segment tests for vehicles that will revolutionize access to space,…It’s real hardware. It’s real physics. We’re getting real data…and it’s not paper studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

There is a tendency for people to overestimate their own knowledge even when they have no basis for their confidence (even skeptics – we all do this). Often this amounts to just making up answers because they feel right and then assuming they are correct. We all do this – believers and skeptics alike. This is the default mode of human thinking. It takes discipline to insert the critical thinking filter – “is this really true? what does the evidence actually say?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific topic at hand is attitudes toward so-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) – how popular is it, and what is the basis for its popularity? &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=203"&gt;I have dealt before &lt;/a&gt;with the former question. Here’s the summary: most surveys that site huge numbers of people using CAM are grossly inflating the numbers by including things such as exercise, prayer, or taking a multivitamin. I exercise, so by some measures I am a CAM user. This, of course, reflects the confusion caused by the dubious category of CAM itself – it is a pseudo-category, containing a wide variety of modalities, some mutually exclusive, with very fuzzy boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more meaningful to consider individual claims and practices, and to use somewhat tighter categories (such as energy-medicine). If we consider the “hard-core” CAM practices – like homeopathy, acupuncture, and energy medicine – we find that their use is still in the tiny minority – single digits. And these numbers are not significantly changing over time. The popularity of CAM is overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other question (actually two questions) is also interesting – who is using CAM and why? As evidenced by my many discussions on the topic and comments left on my blogs (and others), the most common answer is some variation of  “I guess people must be dissatisfied with mainstream medicine.” In a blog post for SBM this week, in fact, a commenter noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the reason many people turn to CAM is because they feel that the medical practice they have experienced isn’t that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an unreasonable assumption, but like many reasonable assumptions it turns out to be wrong. There have been many surveys and a common theme among them is that most people who use CAM do so because it was in line with their philosophy. The classic study is &lt;a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/279/19/1548"&gt;this one, a 1998 survey published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.  It concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with being more educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who use CAM have disposable income (which makes sense as most CAM is paid for out of pocket), which itself correlates with older age and more education. CAM use also correlates with having some chronic medical complaints, which also makes sense and happens to be true. Surveys also show that the most common CAM modalities (if you don’t include prayer and exercise) are for musculoskeletal complaints – massage, manipulation, yoga, and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we put this all together the profile of the average CAM user is a middle-aged or older adult with cash on hand who is having the typical aches and pains of that stage of life and is looking for a touchy-feely therapy that fits their overall world view. Of course, this is just the typical user, and the numbers also include other profiles, but they seem to be in the minority. The profile we worry about the most are those with a serious life-threatening illness who are drawn to a hard-core CAM modality by desperation or the alure of false hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a new survery, this one Flemish, adding another wrinkle to the data on who is using CAM and why. This survey of Flemish adults was about belief, and not necessarily use. They asked the typical questions, but also surveyed belief in the paranormal. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19587233?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;The study concludes:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support of CAM was very prevalent in this Flemish adult population. CAM beliefs were strongly associated with paranormal beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also confirmed an associated with older age, which again is likely explained by disposable income. Belief in the paranormal and age were the only factors that predicted positive attitudes toward CAM. There was a positive relationship also with level of education and the social desirability of CAM, but these factors were not strongly enough correlated to be predictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit that this result is highly satisfying, and fits well with not only previous data but my personal biases. A world-view that includes belief in magic and the supernatural accords well with many of the claims made within the broad CAM umbrella. This may also reflect a poor understanding of or respect for science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While paranormal belief was the strongest correlate of belief in CAM in this survey, this and other data also reflect that attitudes toward CAM is a complex and multifarious cultural and social phenomenon. It may be dominated by the worried and wonky well, but there are many other types mixed in as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250262140866"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3923">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fbce6554a8ee8cc8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><category term="Intelligent Design Creationism Watch"/><category term="Gene Expression"/><category term="General Social Survey"/><title type="html">It takes a generation</title><published>2009-08-14T14:12:27Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T14:12:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/it-takes-a-generation/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Greg Mayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/the_future_belongs_to_the_darw.php"&gt;Gene Expression&lt;/a&gt;, Razib, following up on one of &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/mooney-and-kirshenbaum-self-destruct-at-last/"&gt;Jerry’s posts on Mooney &amp;amp; Kirshenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, looks more closely at survey data on public acceptance of evolution, and finds cause for optimism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would repeat a data finding which might cheer us up: &lt;strong&gt;the youngest adult age cohorts are the least Creationist. &lt;/strong&gt;(emphasis in original)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, there is a roughly linear increase in the percent responding “True” to the statement “Human beings developed from animals”, from 43% in the 60 years old + cohort, to 59% in the 18-30 cohort. There are some interesting differences depending on the phrasing of the question, notably substituting “evolved” for “developed” gets a lower score, 56%, among 18-30 year olds, rather than 59% (I don’t know enough details of the &lt;a href="http://www.norc.org/GSS+Website/"&gt;General Social Survey&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the statistical or practical significance of this difference). Also, among believers, there are big differences between Protestants and Catholics: 78% of young Catholics respond “True”, but only 33% of young Protestants (which is the same as elderly Protestants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the most recent attempts at improving scientific literacy (90s and 00s) may be having more effect than earlier efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: In comments here  below and at Razib’s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/the_future_belongs_to_the_darw.php"&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;, several people have asked questions or posed hypotheses about the further interrelations of variables. The GSS data are available &lt;a href="http://sda.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+gss08"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Razib has done some &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/08/rising_rejection_of_creationis.php#more"&gt;further analyses&lt;/a&gt;, comparing acceptance of evolution to age and a vocabulary knowledge item that he regards as a proxy for intelligence.  Money quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall no surprise, and it looks like a general trend is for the smart and the young to reject Creationism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scientific questions (especially more technical ones) are not matters of opinion but have a correct answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists document their procedures and findings in the peer-reviewed literature in such a way that they can be double-checked and challenged by others. The proper way to challenge results is, of course, also through the peer-reviewed literature, so that the challenge follows the same standards of documentation as did the original finding.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a challenge can either be in form of a new, independent paper, or in the form of a comment to a published paper. The latter is the appropriate avenue if the challenge is not based on new data (and is thus a piece of research in its own right), but is a criticism of the methods used in a paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such technical comments are routinely published in journals, and RealClimate authors have of course also been involved in writing or receiving such comments. One prominent example was a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/312/5773/529b"&gt;comment in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing that a challenge by Von Storch et al. (2004) to the “hockey stick” climate reconstruction of Mann et al. (1998) “was based on incorrect implementation of the reconstruction procedure”. We &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/04/a-correction-with-repercussions/"&gt;discussed the implications on Realclimate&lt;/a&gt; after the comment appeared. Another recent example was a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/sci;317/5846/1866c.pdf"&gt;comment by Schmith et al. &lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;315/5810/368"&gt;paper on sea level rise by Stefan&lt;/a&gt;, noting that he failed to account for the effect of smoothing on the autocorrelation in the data he used. In his &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/317/5846/1866d"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;, Stefan acknowledged this mistake but showed that it does not affect his main conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the original authors are allowed to respond to a comment in the same journal issue, and the comment’s authors get to consider this response before deciding to go ahead with their comment, are key hallmarks of a fair procedure, in addition to a neutral journal editor and independent reviewers overseeing the process. Even if the authors of comment and reply continue to disagree to some extent, this comment process in most cases resolves the issue to the satisfaction of the scientific community. It lays out the facts in a fair and transparent way and gives outsiders a good basis for judging whom is right. In this way it advances science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is however a different way of criticizing scientific papers that is prevalent in blogs like ClimateAudit.  This involves challenging, ‘by all means necessary’, any paper whose conclusions are not liked.  This can be based on simple typos, basic misunderstandings of the issues and ‘guilt by association’ though there is sometimes the occasional interesting point. Since these claims are rarely assessed to see if there is any actual impact on the main result, the outcome is a series of misleading critiques, regardless of whether any of these criticisms are in fact even valid or salient, that give the impression that every one of these papers is worthless and that all their authors incompetent at best and dishonest at worst.  It is the equivalent of claiming to have found spelling errors in a newspaper article. Fun for a while, but basically irrelevant for understanding any issue or judging the worth of the journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While commentary — even quite negative commentary — of papers on blogs is entirely reasonable (after all, we do it here occasionally), claims that a particular paper has been ‘discredited’ or ‘falsified’ that have not withstood (at minimum) the process of peer-review should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  So should accusations of dishonesty or misconduct that have not already been conclusively and unequivocally substantiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the recent claim by Hu McCulloch that a post on &lt;a href="http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=5341" rel="nofollow"&gt; ClimateAudit.org&lt;/a&gt;, detailing an error in Steig et al’s paper in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; on Antarctic temperature change, was not given due credit by Steig et al. when they published a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08286.html"&gt;Corrigendum&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. In this case, McCulloch’s comment on the paper were perfectly valid, but he chose to avoid the context of normal scientific exchange — instead posting his comments on ClimateAudit.org — and then playing a game of ‘gotcha’ by claiming plagiarism when he wasn’t cited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCulloch accuses Steig et al. of appropriating his ‘finding’ that Steig et al. did not account for autocorrelation when calculating the significance of trends.  While the published version of the paper didn’t include such a correction, it is obvious that the authors were aware of the need to do so, since in the text of the paper it is stated that this correction was made.  The corrected calculations were done using well-known methods, the details of which are available in myriad statistics textbooks and journal articles.  There can therefore be no claim on Dr. McCulloch’s part of any originality either for the idea of making such a correction, nor for the methods for doing so, all of which were discussed in the original paper.  Had Dr. McCulloch been the first person to make Steig et al. aware of the error in the paper, or had he written directly to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; at any time prior to the submission of the Corrigendum, it would have been appropriate to acknowledge him and the authors would have been happy to do so.  Lest there be any confusion about this, we note that, as discussed in the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08286.html"&gt;Corrigendum&lt;/a&gt;, the error has no impact on the main conclusions in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with constructive criticism, and pointing out errors — even fairly minor ones — is important and useful. The difference, though, between people who want to find out something about the real world and people who just want to score political points, is what is made of those errors.  That is the test of constructive scientific dialog.  Specious accusations of fraud, plagiarism and the like don’t pass such a test; instead they simply poison the atmosphere to everyone’s loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>group</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250262045235"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/friday_sprog_blogging_kids_day.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c9fc87fc7a4d5e82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kids and science"/><title type="html">Friday Sprog Blogging: Kids Day at SLAC 2009.</title><published>2009-08-14T15:23:03Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T15:23:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/_7kyy55IRT4/friday_sprog_blogging_kids_day.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/friday_sprog_blogging_kids_day.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks again to the generosity of Free-Ride friend LO, the elder Free-Ride offspring will be partaking in this year's &lt;a href="http://www-project.slac.stanford.edu/kidsday/2009/default.htm"&gt;Kids Day at SLAC&lt;/a&gt; today.

 The origin of human bipedalism has long been a hot topic among paleoanthropologists. At the very least it is seen as something of a marker for the emergence of the first hominin, yet it remains unclear whether the earliest hominins evolved from a terrestrial, knuckle-walking ancestor or a more arboreal ape. A common interpretation is that since our closest living relatives, gorillas and chimpanzees, are both knuckle-walkers then the first hominins, too, evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor. As Tracy Kivell and Daniel Schmitt explain in a new PNAS paper, though, this idea may overlook subtle differences between chimpanzees and gorillas that may help us understand the evolution of the earliest hominins.

Gorillas are physically larger than chimpanzees, so it might be expected that they would have more rigid wrists that would help stabilize them as they walked around on their knuckles. This is not what Kivell and Schmitt found. Not only did gorillas have a much greater range of wrist motion than chimpanzees, but it was the chimpanzees that had adaptations in their wrists to increase stability. Despite being more terrestrial and knuckle-walking on the ground more often gorillas actually showed fewer "classic" knuckle-walking adaptations in their wrist bones than chimpanzees did!

Integration occurs in higher areas in the brain usually in areas belonging to the parietal lobe1) Integrating Vision and Proprioception in Area 5 ( Graziano et. al (2000))Brodmann Area 5 (or Area 5) is part of the parietal cortex in humans, and in monkeys, is a subdivision of the parietal lobe, occupying primarily the superior parietal lobule. Graziano et. al (2000) studied single neuron responses from Area 5 of monkeys. In their experiments, the arm contralateral to the recording site was outstretched. The real arm of the monkey was covered, and instead a realistic fake hand was kept in view.  The experimental design was 2 x 22 x 2 experimental design. Cross indicates fixation spot. The gray arm is the fake arm. The real arm is covered in the experiment (Graziano et. al (2000))Single neuron recordings indicated that the firing rate of individual neurons depends not only on the position of the real arm, but also on the position of the fake arm. The neuron is significantly affected by the  position of the real arm, firing more when he real arm is to the left. Additionally, the firing rate further increases when the fake arm is also to the left. Single neuron recording from Area 5.  The firing rate is maximum when the real and the fake arms are in congruent position (Graziano et. al (2000))2) Integrating Vision and Touch in Ventral Intraparietal Area (Duhamel et. al (1998))The Ventral Intraparietal Area (or VIP) is a discrete area in the depths of the intraparietal sulcus. Duhamel et. al carried out single neuron recordings in the VIP. They found the neurons to possess a bimodal receptive field. Not only did they respond to a combination of visual and tactile stimuli, but the bimodal receptive fields were arranged in an orderly manner.Bimodal receptive fields of VIP neurons (Duhamel et. al (1998))Small central visual receptive fields  were associated with small tactile receptive fields on the muzzle, whereas large peripheral receptive fields were associated with  large tactile receptive fields on the side of the head or body. The neurons also demonstrated direction selectivity, in the sense that a visual or tactile stimulus moving in one direction was preferred over the other, and this preferred direction of visual and tactile stimuli coincided in the majority of cells. Direction selectivity of VIP neurons (Duhamel et. al (1998))ReferencesGraziano, M.

Speaking of successful orbiters, the HiRISE camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_013954_1780"&gt;a very cool picture of the crater Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, where the rover Opportunity spent more than a Martian year exploring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/ESP_013954_1780_cut.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/mro_victoria.jpg" alt="MRO shot of Victoria crater on Mars"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, you wanna click and embiggen that. When you do, and look to the left, you can see Opportunity’s wheel tracks in the Martian surface!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool. The crater is fascinating to me. There has been extensive reshaping to it after it formed; those scallops must be where the surface gave way, causing landslides into the crater, and in fact you can see streaks in the crater wall from mass movement. The ripples in the center are sand dunes, making an almost organic web of material. And you can see boulders strewn along the crater as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is different than ones before it due to the angle; instead of looking straight down into the pit, it’s seen from about 22 degrees from vertical. This slight change is enough to give scientists insight into the crater walls and other structures. The crater is a little over 700 meters across, or a bit less than half a mile. I hope that gives you a sense of scale for what &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu"&gt;HiRISE&lt;/a&gt; can spot; its resolution is less than one meter. &lt;/p&gt;

In other words, it's run by adults. But scientists often disagree about things. This is apparently a secret to non-scientists and many reporters who assume that when two scientists disagree, one is lying or wrong. But it's true nonetheless. Whatever the subdiscipline, there are disagreements. If you pick up almost any issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; you will find plenty of them, usually (but not always) couched in polite language in the Introduction or Discussion section of a paper or in the Letters. So it's not surprising that I disagree with revere's piece from yesterday: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/08/science-based_medicine_101_fai.php"&gt;"Science-Based Medicine 101": FAIL&lt;/a&gt;. Actually I don't just disagree. I think it is quite wrong headed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but I couldn't resist appropriating revere's very own words and twisting them to my nefarious purpose. As much as I like Effect Measure in general and respect the reveres, who put it together, it's no secret that at least one revere and I have had our differences in the past, for instance on BPA. (And don't get either of us started on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.) However, I like to think that we share far more areas of broad agreement than butt heads over areas of disagreements. In fact, I even mostly agree with much of what he said in his post. That being said, I nonetheless think that revere is being quite wrong-headed (word choice intentional) in how he said what he said thus earned a FAIL, perhaps even an EPIC FAIL. Instead of producing a helpful caveat and clarification to what was intentionally a simple introduction for a lay audience, he instead chose path of pedantry, and, given my involvement with SBM I don't think I can just sit back and let it stand unanswered, because, well, that's just how I roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at what Val Jones, the target of revere's pedantry, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=600"&gt;prefaced her post with&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought I'd do a little SBM 101 series for our lay readers. Forgive me if this information is too basic... at least it's a place to start for those who are budding scientists and critical thinkers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, right from the start, there are many hints that Val's post was intended to be very basic. It was clearly meant as an introduction to how to evaluate the reliability of a source for people who haven't thought of evaluating sources of medical and scientific information before. So, what does revere respond with? The viewpoint of an senior epidemiologist with numerous grants and publications to his credit, as well as many years of experience in medical and scientific academia:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/effect_measure_on_science-based_medicine.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/effect_measure_on_science-based_medicine.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/-W796m4JNxQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250256457064"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3903">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/86d21f887aced835</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><title type="html">Yale University Press refuses to show Muhammad cartoons in a book about them</title><published>2009-08-14T12:49:33Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T12:49:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/14/yale-university-press-wont-show-mohammed-cartoons-in-a-book-about-them/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As most of us remember, in 2005 there was a huge furor when a Danish newspaper, &lt;em&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/em&gt;, published twelve cartoons showing the Islamic prophet Muhammad, some of the images fairly innocuous, others using Muhammad to make a critical statement about Islam. (The most famous of the latter depicted Muhammad wearing a turban in the shape of a bomb.)   Much of the Muslim world objected to showing an image of the prophet — which some of the faithful interpret as forbidden by the Qur’an — and to the perceived insult to faith conveyed by some of the cartoons. This led to to rioting throughout the Muslim world, and to the deaths of over 200 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as reported by &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/books/13book.html?_r=1"&gt;Wednesday’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Yale University Press is publishing a book about these cartoons, &lt;em&gt;The Cartoons that Shook the World&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;will not show the cartoons in that book&lt;/em&gt;. (Other images of Muhammad that apparently do not depict him as a harbinger of violence were also kept from inclusion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Donatich, the director of Yale University Press, said by telephone that the decision was difficult, but the recommendation to withdraw the images, including the historical ones of Muhammad, was “overwhelming and unanimous.” The cartoons are freely available on the Internet and can be accurately described in words, Mr. Donatich said, so reprinting them could be interpreted easily as gratuitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratuitous?  In a book about them?  I cannot imagine a book about the history of racist political cartoons in America, for instance, that wouldn’t show some of these cartoons.  And I have often seen images of anti-Semitic cartoons in discussions about the Nazi persecution of Jews (see &lt;a href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/ww2era.htm#Antisem"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, images of Muhammad have been published before without causing problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many Muslims believe the Koran prohibits images of the prophet, Muhammad has been depicted through the centuries in both Islamic and Western art without inciting disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy, then, seems to be less about showing the prophet himself than about inciting disturbance by publishing cartoons that criticize Islam.  But it is bizarre to have an academic discussion about these images without showing them, especially when the Press tells readers that (wink wink) you can easily find the images elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I believe that I may be the first person to have realized that &lt;em&gt;compared&lt;/em&gt; is a preposition. It is not listed as such in any of the dictionaries that I consulted, and you may very well be wondering how compared could possibly be a preposition. Let me try to explain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Brett's argument starts with the observation that sentence-initial participial adjuncts are often felt to be "danglers" when not predicated of the subject of the following clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Fearing a massive lay-off, there was a general sense of relief when the boss announced there would be no new budget cuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, prepositional-phrase adjuncts don't have this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;After a massive lay-off, there was a general sense of anger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then observes that what seem to be past-particle adjuncts with "compared to" behave in this respect more like PPs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Compared to ICS alone, there was a significantly greater improvement in FEV1 with the addition of LABA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a valid argument, but not a new one. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"&gt;CGEL&lt;/a&gt; discusses it in chapter 7, section 2.3 (pp. 610-611);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For the most part, verbs are clearly distinguishable from prepositions by their ability to occur as head of a main clause and to inflect for tense. There are, however, a number of prepositions that have arisen through the conversion of secondary, non-tensed, forms of verbs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[21] i  [&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Barring&lt;/span&gt; accidents,] they should be back today.&lt;br&gt;
ii  There are five of them, [&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;counting/including&lt;/span&gt; the driver.]&lt;br&gt;
iii  [&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Pertaining&lt;/span&gt; to the contract negotiations,] there is nothing to report.&lt;br&gt;
iv  [&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Given&lt;/span&gt; his age,] a shorter prison sentence is appropriate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The basis for analysing the underlined words here as prepositions is that there is no understood subject. This is effectively the same criterion as we have used in distinguishing prepositions from adjectives: prepositions can be used in adjunct function without a predicand, i.e. and element of which they are understood to be predicated. The preposition counting in [ii], for example, is to be distinguished from the gerund-participial verb-form in:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[22]  [Counting his money before going to bed last night,] Max discovered that two $100 notes were missing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The boundary between the prepositional construction [21] and the verbal [22] is slightly blurred by the usage illustrated in:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[23] i   [Turning now to sales,] there are very optimistic signs.&lt;br&gt;
ii  [Bearing in mind the competitive environments,] this is a creditable result.&lt;br&gt;
iii  [Having said that,] it must be admitted that the new plan also has advantages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;These differ from [22] in that no subject for the underlined verb is recoverable from the matrix clause. They are similar to what prescriptivists call the 'dangling participle' construction illustrated in examples such as *Walking down the street, his hat fell off, ungrammatical in the sense where it was he, not his hat, that was walking down the street. Unlike the latter, however, the examples in [23] are generally regarded as acceptable. They differ from the prepositional construction in that there is still an understood subject roughly recoverable from the context as the speaker or the speaker and addressees together.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://english-jack.blogspot.com/"&gt;second post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject, Brett adds some other examples, as well as a persuasive new argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Another piece of evidence comes from coordination. Typically parallelism dictates that we coordinate only like with like. It would not typically allow us to coordinate a PP with a VP. In the following sentences, however, we have a PP coordinated with a phrase headed by 'compared':&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Americans live very well, both &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; historical standards&lt;/span&gt; AND &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;compared&lt;/span&gt; to other people in the world today&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A major finding, however, was that emissions at the four sites differed greatly both &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;between&lt;/span&gt; sites&lt;/span&gt; AND &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;compared&lt;/span&gt; to national trends in emissions between 1970 and 1990.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, this shows that the &amp;quot;compared to&amp;quot; phrases are serving as adverbial adjuncts in parallel to the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;by&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;-PP. A participial phrase that is clearly in apposition with a subject doesn&amp;#39;t generally conjoin with adverbials this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Unexpectedly and counting her money, Sally found $100 missing.&lt;br&gt;
*With a wink and talking on his cell phone, John ran out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

The woman had died at a young age, and while the family wasn’t religious, they had a minister speak at the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s bad enough that the minister knew nothing about the deceased woman… but he decided to take the opportunity to &lt;a href="http://forum.friendlyatheist.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=2350"&gt;preach to everyone grieving in the audience&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then he started to preach fire and brimstone. He said that the dead woman had attended church when she was a kid and accepted Jesus at VBS, so she was in heaven where there were “mansions” and “the streets are paved with gold.” Then, he said that everyone could have the “hope” of joining her in heaven. And preached about each letter of the word HOPE, having them stand for Heaven (the carrot), Options (heaven or hell), Peace (I think, I was kind of reeling at the inappropriateness at this point), and Eternity (what you risk if you don’t become a Christian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He described Hell in detail — making sure we all understood that we would not get to be with our non-Christian friends and that we’d be separated forever from God and everyone else.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JulietEcho finds the sermon unethical.  I do, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This family didn’t specifically request this speech, but it sounds like the minister may have delivered this before.  Are there any Christian families who &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; want that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the purpose of a funeral be to remember the deceased or proselytize to the living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you hope happens at your funeral?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have subsequently been lead to believe that none of the information on the website http://www.marshallprotocol.com can be considered up to date or accurate.  As as result of,  I have told that my post is chockablock with errors, although, outside of writing doxycycline where I should have put minocycline, I am left in the dark as to exactly what my errors are.  I am told that it is my responsibility to locate the errors in the last post, yet I can find none when compared to the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to remedy the deficiency of having reviewed inaccurate and out of date material,  I have been sent 6 articles that I am informed represent the state of the art in understanding the science behind the Marshall protocol.  Ah, the peer reviewed medical literature.  An opportunity to carefully read and critique new  ideas.  It is one of the reasons people publish: to see if their ideas can withstand the scrutiny of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of these papers concern Vitamin D,  the Vitamin D receptor, and olmesartan which I will review, perhaps, another time.  I don’t find them a compelling read, but it not an area about which I have more than a standard medical knowledge. The other papers concern the role of infection in autoimmune diseases, which I will discuss here.  It is easier as an infectious disease doctor  to read this literature as I am, as least as far as the American Board on Internal Medicine is concerned, a specialist in the field.  Alternatively, I am a closed minded tool of the medical industrial complex who only seeks to push his own twisted, narrow agenda at the expense of suffering patients (1).  We can’t all be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main article, which was published in July of this year, is “Autoimmune disease in the era of the metagenome (2)” will be discussed along with several (2, 3) references that are, as of the writing of this post, not yet published. For the clarity, footnotes in ‘()’ are mine, footnotes in ‘[]” are from the referenced material. I added any bold face type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article starts with an interesting sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to the NIH, a mere 10% of the cells that comprise the organism known as Homo sapiens are human cells. The remaining 90% are bacterial in origin. Thus, Homo sapiens is best described as a superorganism in which a large number of different organisms coexist as one (1).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is certainly a curious way to think about the microbial ecosystem we carry around with us.  It is true that there are 10 to 100 times more bacteria on us than there are cells that make us up (for the sake of clarity, bacteria on the skin and in the GI tract I will refer to as on us even though from one perspective the bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract are in us. Prepositions can be imprecise.   But the GI tract is contiguous with the environment, so I will use the word on.  To be in us, the bacteria will have had to breech the cells  that line us and be in the blood, the cytoplasm, the nucleus, the interstitial spaces, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are covered in bacteria and carry a complex ecosystem that we are just beginning to understand and of which we can grow or, by molecular techniques, identify a minority.  However those cells are not us.  While we do have some interaction with these bacteria, they are not the cells that make us.  It would be the same as saying that the cells of the fleas on a dog are part of what constitutes a dog or the cells of a monkey in a tree are part of what constitutes a tree.  There is self, and there is not-self, and our bacteria are not-self. Our genome is what we pass on to our children with reproduction.  So the opening sentence does not inspire confidence in the authors understanding of what constitutes being human.  From my understanding of human-microbial interaction the opening sentence is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Medicine is now comfortable with the bacterial populations that exist in the gut and areas of the body in contact with the external environment, such as the mouth, ears, nose and skin. Yet, components of the human microbiota also likely persist in many other body tissues, including those which become inflamed in autoimmune disease [5] (1).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference 5 is a video of a lecture of one of the authors which is a keynote address summarizing the ideas found in the articles discussed here. You evaluate a review by the quality of the arguments and the quality of the referenced material.  It has more credence if  the information is based on first class, reproduced research in high impact journals. Linking to your own lectures?  Well,  no so much.   I should put up YouTube video of me reading this blog and link to it as proof of the assertions in this entry as I suppose an on line video constitutes now constitutes valid, scholarly reference material. See. It’s on the interwebs, so it must be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they appears to be saying is the complex microbiology found on us is also to be be found in us, in our cells and tissues,  and are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They continue with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such bacteria can persist inside the very cells of the immune system that are supposed to kill them [6], or in bioﬁlm communities in which they are protected from the immune response by a self-created polymeric matrix [7].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference in regards to persisting bacteria is  scanning electron microscopy (EM) of white cells in three patients with eye disease and the alleged pathogens were never shown as living organisms nor have the findings of the paper ever been reproduced or verified by others.   Dr. Witosko, the author of reference 6,  published a number of studies in the 1980’s where he found what he considered to be mycoplasms in several diseases, the proof of an infection being based on EM and response to antibiotics.  Unfortunately since that time, his findings have not been confirmed by other researchers.  Searching Pubmed for mycoplasms and uveitis, sarcoid, Crohn’s and JRA yield next to nothing.  If the primary references to support your hypothesis, at least the ones that are not internet videos, are one off’s, never reproduced or verified, then the foundation upon which your are building your argument may be less than solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria can persist for short times in phagocytic cells during acute infections.  However, extrapolating from this paper to  bacteria living for years in phagocytes for the lifetime of the patient with an autoimmune disease  is a leap across the Grand Canyon of medical hypothesis.  Biofilms are important in persisting infections associated with prosthetic material and osteomyelitis but the role of biofilms in other diseases not associated with inert material is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they are building an argument for disease pathogenesis, based in large part on examples and parallel, for infections due to colonies of as of yet undiscovered organisms that evade the immune system and live in biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because some organisms cannot be isolated, ours exist and cannot be isolated. Because some organisms can evade the immune system, ours evade the immune system. Because some organisms live in biofilms, ours live in biofilms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next paragraph concerns the easy exchange of bacterial DNA and how calling an organism E. coli may by old fashioned.  I am sympathetic  to this view of bacteria, because at one level, given their ability to exchange and utilize DNA, bacteria are a metagenome and our classification of bacteria can be imprecise.  I tend to think of bacterial identification as probability functions rather than an absolute characteristic.  They are fuzzy, and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Due to their small size, hundreds, or even thousands, of bacterial cells can ﬁt inside a human cell [6]. The combined genetic contributions of these microbes inevitably provide myriad gene products not encoded by our own relatively small genomes. This means that the human genome is only one of the many genomes that affect Homo sapiens function. In reality, the organism we call Homo sapiens is controlled by a metagenome, a tremendous number of different genomes working in parallel. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this seems ludicrous to me.  Sure.  We have covered with millions of bacterial genes and in some places there is an ongoing interaction between the bacteria and us.  But to suggest that these genes in bacteria are part of our genes and controlling  us is an unwarranted extrapolation and, in my understanding, more science fiction than science fact. And just because thousands of bacteria could fit into a cell it doesn’t mean they do.  One would think, given the last 50 years of light and other forms of microscopy and the ongoing search for infectious etiologies of most autoimmune diseases (a search that keeps coming up negative) that someone, some time, would have noticed huge numbers of bacteria stuffed into cells.  And that such findings would be easily reproduced by others.  Curiously, that hasn’t happened.  So if the bacteria don’t seem to fit, we must acquit…. sorry for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another odd example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial gene products can be very similar to our own. For example, the metabolism of glucose-6-phosphate by both the human body and E.coli is nearly identical, so that remarkably similar metabolites are produced by both species [11]. With this in mind, the interaction between an E.coli genome and the human genome, as they exchange nutrition and toxins, increases the complexity of transcription and translation for both species.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to evolution, we do share many common metabolic pathways with many bacteria; it is why some antibiotics will affect human cells and some anticancer drugs will affect bacteria.  However, the role of  the interaction of bacterial metabolic products, out side of locally,  is currently speculative in disease.  They then mention that in a test tube system that probiotic bacteria grown in skim milk make enzymes that inhibit angiotensin 1 converting enzyme.  How this is relevant to human systems requires  another huge leap.  It is always a question whether test tube examples have clinical relevance.  In this case, unlikely, as we are not skim milk and the bacterial strains in probiotics are usually different than the strains found in us. Possible, but I would not generate a treatment plan based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors then give examples of how two genes are altered by bacteria in the test tube: one up regulated, one down regulated. No argument here.  When infected the body responds in a variety of ways.  Genes get up regulated and down regulated.  It is always a question whether these test tube phenomena are of clinical relevance or if they are lost in  the complex human metabolic system. Often  these effects are the equivalent of tossing a rock in the Oregon ocean and to increase the size of the waves in Hawaii.   The effects are too small to be noticed, butterflies and hurricanes not withstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the move on to capnine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Created by the gliding bacteria that are present in bioﬁlm, the sulfonolipid Capnine provides a speciﬁc example of how a bacterial metabolite could manipulate human gene expression in order to dramatically alter the progression of autoimmune and other chronic diseases.Capnine has the capacity to disrupt transcription by the VDR, one of the body’s most proliﬁc nuclear receptors [15].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note could, not does. And the proof?  The reference is from a paper that is from computer modeling of the interaction of capnine and the VDR. Again with the computer modeling. No real data to show an interaction of this molecule and the VDR.  No data to show that this molecule has ever been found outside of biofilm where it could have pharmacologic effects.  Going from computer modeling to disease pathogenesis and treatment is another huge stretch.  As a clinician I am not impressed.  Computer models are interesting but have to be compared to that pesky reality before they can be taken seriously.  It is a shame that one cannot jump straight from the computer model to real life, as I would love a computer model that would makes me a Powerball winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thus, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; Capnine was deregulating the VDR, it would greatly hamper the innate immune response. VDR dysfunction would cause the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-D to rise to excessively high  levels where it could inhibit expression by the bulk of the body’s other nuclear receptors -including alpha thyroid, the glucocorticoid receptor, and the androgen receptor [20]. This would result in hormonal imbalances and also interfere with expression of the dozens of other AmPs expressed by these receptors. In vivo, the microbiota appears to gradually shut down the innate immune response over a person’s lifetime, resulting in the increased accumulation of chronic bacteria and other pathogens [21]. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If wishes were horses, Beggars would ride: If turnips were watches, I would wear one by my side. If capnine was pathogenic, Bacteria would more than glide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All an unproven speculation presented as fact, all following from could and if.  There is no in vitro or in vivo data to suggest that capnine is involved in anything but the production of biofilms.  Reference 21 leads to a speculative review that will be discussed later,  not original research.  But none of this is based on original research in real biologic systems.  The shutting down of the immune system by bacteria,  while stated as fact, is yet more unproven speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, genes from the accumulating microbial metagenome may determine a clinical disease symptomatology such as an autoimmune diagnosis, or simply drive the inﬂammation associated with the aches and pains of aging [5]. This accumulation is an extremely logical evolutionary survival mechanism. Components of the human microbiome have evolved to dysregulate the VDR receptor that would otherwise activate a potent immune response against its presence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.  Most bacteria in our microbial metagenome are simply not pathogenic and lack the capacity to invade and cause disease. Bacteria need to have the capacity to cause disease, and most do not. They live outside of us, on us, and in symbiosis with us. Even if you wipe out most of the immune system with chemotherapy or AIDS and patients become ill with their own bacteria invading, the number of pathogens in these patients is limited relative to the number of bacteria  they have.  Of our thousand bacterial species, I only have to worry about a couple dozen.  Of the millions of microbial species in the world, less than a thousand have the ability to infect humans.   Most bacteria simply can’t cause disease.  They do not need to have evolved to dysregulate the Vitamin D receptor to survive.  Unless, of course, they are forming large, unseen, intracellular colonies, which as best as I can tell, they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Royston Goodacre comments in Journal of Nutrition, we are born with a genome that, aside from the genes of species that can survive in the womb and endometrium [22], is largely human. But we inevitably die with a genome that is at least 90% bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsense.  The genome that is on us is not the genome that is in us. Our genome, what makes us human, is what we pass on with reproduction and those genes are most certainly not bacterial in origin.  I suppose under this paradigm,  that if you were to drown in a sewage pit, then you would die with an even greater genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They move on to discuss antibody production as a result of infection with the metagenome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet now that Homo sapiens is understood to be the product of multiple genomes, it is equally possible that the antibodies observed in autoimmune disease result from alteration of human genes and gene products by the bacterial metagenome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take one unsupported hypothesis as true then anther unsupported hypothesis is equally true. We are not the product of multiple genomes, that is hyperbole.  But if you repeat something frequently enough,  maybe it will be considered true despite a lack of evidence.  Works for politicians.   Are they saying that the metagenome alters our genes to cause disease?  That the bacteria lead to genetic mutations?  They are not talking natural selection here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are saying that the DNA is altered by the bacteria. News to me, and, if true, leads to a new understanding of disease pathophysiology.   It is only “equally possible,”  although I would classify that speculation as extremely unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is a discussion of how the bacterial flora varies in time and in location and as a result the products of that bacterial flora will change with time.  No argument here, the ongoing ebb and flow of out bacterial flora is just beginning to be elucidated.  How this alters disease manifestation is hinted at in the text, but I infer that different microbiota in people will lead to different autoimmune diseases.  Which would be good excuse for the not finding a consistent pathogen causing  a given disease in each patient. Each patient has a different microbial metagenome causing their sarcoid or RA or whatever disease is present.   I admit to being wedded to the idea that one bug causes one disease.  For over a century that concept,  at the core of Koch’s postulates (5), have helped to discover the cause of everything from AIDS  to Zygomycetes.  If inference is true, it may make the pathophysiology espoused in this paper unable to be tested or falsified.  It would also make the it impossible to isolate the infecting organisms and test it to see what is the optimal antibiotic to be used to kill it.  A clinician could never say that the patient DIDN’T have a disease, which is often important information to give a patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they move on to where and how the microbiota cause disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persistent bacteria including Francisella tularensis [25], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [26], Rickettsia massiliae [27], Brucella spp. [28], Listeria monocytogenes [29], Salmonella typhimurium [30] and others, use a variety of mechanisms to evade the immune response and survive inside macrophages and other phagocytic cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the rare pathogen that survives, usually for a relatively short time, in the cytoplasm of cells.  Eventually it either kills the host in relatively short order or is cured. Chronic infection of cells is not the norm of these organisms, although extracellular persistent infections can occur.   As will be discussed later, it is postulated that cell wall deficient organisms persist in the cytoplasm to cause autoimmune disease.  What is curious about the organisms above is that is the mechanisms by which these organisms evade the immune system are often part of, well, er, the cell wall.  Often what allows bacteria to evade the immune system and survive intracellularly is due to constituents on the cell wall and  I would suppose that cell wall deficient organisms would lack that mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Furthermore, various species of bacteria have been detected inside the cells of patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [31],sarcoidosis [6], and other inflammatory diseases [32].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for a reproducible infection in these and other autoimmune diseases continues and I will not be surprised if one day  one or more microbes are found at the center of a sarcoid granuloma. Or in a JRA joint.  But the consistent, reproducible demonstration of an infectious agent in any of these autoimmune diseases is still pending.   When they discover an infectious cause of some of these autoimmune diseases, it will probably be one lone organism, not a colony.  If it takes a village of bacteria to cause a metropolis of diseases, that would be a novel pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that disease-causing microbiota largely persist in the cytoplasm of nucleated cells, where it has access to both the DNA transcription and protein translation machinery of Homo sapiens. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? It does? If so, where are they?  Colonies of bacteria should be seen by light or electron microscopy and yet for 100 years these bacteria have evaded detection. Romulan cloaking technology is probably beyond their capacity. It might be suggested, but it has never been noticed.  There are the occasional reports of quasi bacterial products found in the cells on EM, never reproduced, never confirmed by alternative techniques.  Just where are they in all the specimens in all the pathology labs all over the world?  It should be easy enough to find the microbiota, should they not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microorganisms are also capable of integrating their DNA with our own [36]. This results in alteration of the human DNA by the microbiota over time, potentially leading to genetic mutations associated with autoimmune diagnoses. Genetic haplotypes observed in autoimmune disease frequently have very low statistical significance, as would be expected based on knowledge that the metabolome varies from population to population and individual to individual.  In addition, host DNA repair mechanisms are susceptible to modification by the products of the metabolome. In fact, bacteria may hijack DNA repair mechanisms to generate genetic diversity without losing genomic stability [37, 38].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microorganisms referred to is a herpes virus, and there are a few viruses, herpes and retrovirus, that can insert its DNA into ours.  The paper refers to bacteria as the constituents of the microbiota and then they switch to a virus and do not bother to mention it.  That is disingenuous at best and misleading to anyone who did not bother to go to the footnotes.  This kind of scholarship is not reassuring to the reader.   However, higher organisms (bacteria, mycoplasma etc) do not put their DNA into ours.  There is zero data to suggest that the accumulation of bacterial DNA in humans accounts for autoimmune disease.  This is stated as if it were fact, when it is closer to science fiction. Reference 37 is in an insect and reference 39 is computer modeling.  Quite a leap from a bug and a PC to the cause of human disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have in them colonies of unseen and undiscovered bacteria that persist undetected in the cytoplasm and alter our genome in ways as of yet proven to suppresses the immune system by way of uncharacterized and unproven metabolites interacting with  the Vitamin D receptor to cause a wide variety of autoimmune diseases ranging from sarcoid to diabetes. Hey, I’m convinced. Nothing like lots of speculation and extrapolation from primary sources that are poor in quality and never reproduced or validated by alternative lines of data, and are unsupported by primary &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the reader can see why I am less than enamored of the validity of the pathophysiology noted above. I read dozens of papers a month to keep up in my field. This one is not going to rank high of the compelling review list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does that translate into treating infections?  For that we must turn to “Reversing Bacteria-Induced Vitamin D Receptor Dysfunction  is Key to Autoimmune Disease. (2)”, which is in press. Sorry.  I have a copy and you do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the basic hypothesis from the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An intraphagocytic bacterial microbiota is proposed to be the primary cause of VDR dysfunction.  Because the VDR is key to the innate immune response, its dysfunction would lead to chronic infections with a wide range of pathogens, leading to inflammation and frequent elevation in autoimmune disease markers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the article is a review of the same issue discussed above.  Intracytoplamsic colonization of colonies of bacteria make products that interfere with the VDR.  No new data, no primary research, many of the same references.   I am again going to focus on the infectious disease aspect of the paper, rather than the vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The use of pulsed, subinhibitory, bacteriostatic antibiotics is an important part of this approach. Research indicates that most standard antibiotic protocols used so far to treat chronic inflammatory diseases are ineffective,  and so new ways of using antibiotics are called for to deal with the relative treatment resistance of the bacteria involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this and my jaw dropped.  I promised myself not to be snotty when I evaluated  these papers, but such statements really do deserve ridicule.   Maybe they are ineffective because the disease do not have infectious etiology? Maybe? The new ways of giving antibiotics? Dose them so that they cannot be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the practice of infectious diseases when patients do not respond to therapy, there can be a multitude of reasons for the failure.  One is that the patient does not have an infection.  Another is that the organism is resistant to the antibiotics being used.  In the context of the e pathophysiology of the paper, what they say is that since standard antibiotics at standard doses do not work, they will give the same antibiotic, but dosed intermittently and in small amounts, or in such a way that it should have no effect on the infecting organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your infection is not getting better, so we will continue the antibiotic that is not working, but we will give you less of it.  That would only make sense to a homeopath but if I were to treat infections this way we would have no shortage of cases for morgue conference. However, novel infections get novel therapies, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s assuming that bacteria are involved, which as we have noted, while interesting, is far from proved. Antibiotics are presumed not to work against the bacteria in autoimmune disease as the bacteria are cell wall deficient and the antibiotics are dosed too high. The first part I understand.  If there are indeed L forms persisting in the cytoplasm, which have never been demonstrated definitively in autoimmune diseases, then cell wall active agents will not work. Which is why the tetracycline class (minocycline) and macrolides are used against these bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a long history in infectious disease of the concept of the minimal inhibition concentration.  It takes many more than one antibiotic molecule to inhibit an organism.  How many depends on the antibiotic and the organism, but is takes hundreds of antibiotic molecules to have an effect on a bacterium.  If you fall below the MIC, the organism still grows, although perhaps more slowly.  Using subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics are the quick and easy way to develop resistance to the antibiotics.  What doesn’t kill it makes it stronger.  Currently for most infections you give maximal dose for as short a period of time to maximize killing and minimize the development of resistance.  The opposite of what is suggested in this paper. Of course I am biased by 60 years of the successful treatment of infectious diseases and am stuck in my ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The survival of “persister” cells when constant dosages are used means that pulsed antibiotics are likely to be more effective.[18]  The ability of bacteriostatic antibiotics to be effective at low dosage levels has been documented.[37]“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there is not an infection treated with pulsed antibiotics.  Intermittent antibiotics helps breed resistance. Reference 37 does not concern the ability of low doses of antibiotics to be effective against bacteria, it is an article about the effect on antibiotics on the phagocytosis of bacteria, the ability of cells to ingest bacteria.  In the context of the paper, this appears to be a misrepresentation of primary sources.  Since the alleged bacteria in autoimmune disease are already intracellular, one wonders about the relevance of this reference as it applies to the use of antibiotics as proposed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The existence of communities of multiple bacterial species, like those occurring in biofilms, means that combinations of antibiotics are likely to be necessary to fully target all species. Thus, there is increasing support for the use of pulsed, low dosages of combinations o bacteriostatic antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are these biofilms?  In the cells? Extracellular? Never quite certain where the biofilm is in the context of autoimmune diseases.  Where are the multiple bacterial species?  One does not necessarily need multiple antibiotics just because there are multiple species of bacteria.  Often the judicious and rational use of antibiotics allows one to kill multiple organisms with one antibiotic.  Rather than delaying the development of resistance in bacteria (bacteria, not mycobacteria, so do not use Tb as an example of why I am wrong), multiply antibiotics may intensify the evolutionary pressure on bacteria to become resistant.   There is no support outside the extrapolations of this paper for the use of pulsed, low dose combination antibiotics in any disease that I treat (and cure) for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The waxing and waning of symptoms that typically follows each of the pulsed antibiotic doses supports the model’s contention that bacteria are involved in autoimmune disease. The fact that these immunopathological responses decline over time, as the patient improves during treatment, provides evidence of disease reversal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most risible statement in the paper. An equally unjustified conclusion from a similar paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perez showed that 81% of a group of 54 patients representing 20 different autoimmune diagnoses reported continual improvement after treatment durations of 18-53 months with aVDR agonist and antibiotics – further pointing to bacteria as a causative agent in autoimmune disease.[21] (4)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the reasoning: we dose antibiotics in a manner that should have no effect on bacteria (pulsed and subinhbitory). We therefore conclude that because the ineffectively dosed antibiotics are having an effect, the diseases have an infectious etiology. That’s a clinical paradox that would shut down an M-5 multitronic unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emphasize with the residents that unless you have firm evidence of infection (culture, serology, PCR etc), response to therapy is not a good way to prove an infectious disease etiology.  If they were to make such a  suggestion, I would pat them on the head, smile patronizingly and point out that there are four solutions to an alleged antibiotic response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient improved because they had in infection that responded to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient improved because they had a self limited infection and the antibiotics did nothing.  Treating a viral pneumonia with ampicillin as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient improved because they had a non infectious disease and the antibiotics did nothing.  They received antibiotics for their stasis changes in their legs misdiagnosed as cellulitis but responded to elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient improved because they had a non infectious disease that responded to the antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the last that makes the treatment success problematic to prove.  I used to think that the immunomodulatory effects of antibiotics and other agents were too minor to be of clinical importance.  Now I am not so sure.  The association of NSAID use and the development of group A streptococcus necrotizing fascitis and the possible decreased mortality with infections in patients who are on statins are non-antibiotic examples of possibly clinically relevant effects of minor immunomodulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the tetracycline and the macrolide classes of antibiotics are immunomodulatory, and several recent studies have demonstrated decreased mortality for infections resistant to macrolides that are treated with adjunctive macrolides.  An animal model suggests that the decrease in mortality from macolides is due to a decrease in cytokines.  The minor immunomodulatory effects may, much to my surprise, be clinically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So assuming that tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics are indeed effective in decreasing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases, in the absence of a well defined infection, you cannot know for sure of the result is from the antimicrobial drug treating an infection or the result of an immunomodulatory drug altering immune function.  I bet, since they are dosed at levels to low to be effective against bacteria, that it is the latter that will be the mechanism of action, if, indeed, they are demonstrated in clinical trials to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diseases responding to treatment include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter’s syndrome, type I and II diabetes mellitus and uveitis8 and sarcoidosis. [3] Fibromyalgia, though not generally established as an autoimmune disease, has also responded favorably to this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a recurrent theme in this blog, it is the difficulty of assigning causality to therapeutic interventions, especially when the underlying treatment has no or unproven biologic plausibility. The acupuncturists say their interventions are effective and that chi exists because of anecdotes of efficacy and poorly controlled studies.  Yet when rigorous trials are done, acupuncture is no better than twirling toothpicks on the skin.  The plural of anecdote is anecdotes, not data.  With diseases that can naturally wax and wane there is always a question of true causality with anecdotal information.  Until you do a placebo controlled trial, anecdotal evidence may be interesting but is not definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps  you can see why, as an infectious disease doctor, I am less than convinced about the infectious diseases component of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases as presented in these papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No reproducible, credible evidence that colonies of organisms and their biofilms exist inside of human cells. No evidence outside of in silico (I love that term.  It means computer modeling, but suggests parallel validity with in vivo and in vitro) data to suggest that bacteria make molecules to alter the VDR to suppress immune function.  No controlled trials to suggest that patients are having a response to the antibiotics due its antimicrobial, rather than immunomodulatory, effects.  Antibiotics are used in a manner that has a long history of being ineffective and aids in the development of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of extrapolation, hypothesis and anecdote. To me it is all,  as Shakespeare might say, all sound and fury, signifying nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All aspects of the pathophysiology are amenable to testing, so I could easily be proven wrong.  I can easily  imagine a  clinical trial that would prove or disprove the therapies independent of the theory behind it. It could be that they have the right therapeutic idea for all the wrong reasons. It wouldn’t be the first time in medicine. Take a well defined population of sarcoid or another illness.  4 treatment groups:  2 placebos, one placebo plus antibiotics, one placebo plus olmesartan and both antibiotics and olmesartan. Everyone blinded.   It also makes me wonder: what research would the proponents consider valid in falsifying the pathyphysiology and treatment in the Marshall protocol?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much is made by the fact that these articles are peer reviewed.  After reading the papers closely, what peers and what they were reviewing, I am uncertain. Perhaps spelling and punctuation? They didn’t pay a whole lot of critical attention to the arguments or the references.   Certainly, peer reviewed does not mean true; much of the published literature in medicine is subsequently shown to be incorrect.  It is good to have speculative ideas published, it drives innovation.  To use speculative  ideas as the basis of a complex treatment protocol is not, to mind, the safe and prudent practice of medicine.  I have in my mind a factoid, and I am not sure where I read it,  it so it may be in error, that if you have no data to support a therapeutic intervention, the odds are you will do more harm than good.  I heard that, I think, as a resident almost 25 years ago and could be misremembering, but I am sure the commentators will set me straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It should be noted that the immunopathological reactions resulting from this approach are sometimes strong enough to be life-threatening in patients with more advanced disease.[3]“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good to note that you may be killing people with an intervention.  The ethics of almost killing people with unproven treatments is problematic.  The ethical guidelines for doing research are found in the Declaration of Helsinki, I will quote from the Wikpedia summary, which I sure will lead to derision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research should be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific background (Article 11), a careful assessment of risks and benefits (Articles 16, 17), have a reasonable likelihood of benefit to the population studied (Article 19) and be conducted by suitably trained investigators (Article 15) using approved protocols, subject to independent ethical review and oversight by a properly convened committee (Article 13). The protocol should address the ethical issues and indicate that it is in compliance with the Declaration (Article 14). Studies should be discontinued if the available information indicates that the original considerations are no longer satisfied (Article 17). Information regarding the study should be publicly available (Article 16). Ethical publications extend to publication of the results and consideration of any potential conflict of interest (Article 27). Experimental investigations should always be compared against the best methods, but under certain circumstances a placebo or no treatment group may be utilized (Article 29). The interests of the subject after the study is completed should be part of the overall ethical assessment, including assuring their access to the best proven care (Article 30). Wherever possible unproven methods should be tested in the context of research where there is reasonable belief of possible benefit (Article 32).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not so certain that these (nonbinding) guidelines are being adhered to.  But if you are almost killing people, it really behooves the proponents to subject the therapies to careful clinical trials to make sure the potential for death is worth the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to China, an internationally recognized center of human rights and ethics.  A press release has noted that the Marshall protocol is to be used in the biggest hospital in China. Bigger, of course, is always synonymous with quality.  What is being done in China is not clear:  a clinic to make money and turn out more anecdotes? Like the fake stem cell clinics? Or is a protocol finally to be put to the test with a placebo control blinded trial in a well defined patient population.  If the former, well, I can go to Mexico for a cheaper alternative.  If the latter, I look forward to eating my words when a well done clinical trial demonstrates the efficacy of the Marshall protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

Koch’s postulates are:&lt;br&gt;
1.    The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy animals.&lt;br&gt;
2.    The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.&lt;br&gt;
3.    The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.&lt;br&gt;
4.    The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.&lt;br&gt;
There are ethical and practical limitations to these postulates, but they serve as a reasonable starting point for determining causality.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, I explained to you that the only thing that determines how the Universe expands is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand.php"&gt;the amount of energy density in it&lt;/a&gt;.  But many of you wanted more details.  So, by popular demand -- including one insistence that there is no equation that tells us how the Universe expands -- here is the simplest explanation &lt;i&gt;with math&lt;/i&gt; that I can come up with for the expanding Universe.  If you hate or don't care about math, &lt;b&gt;do not read this&lt;/b&gt;.  This article is not for you.  But if you're curious, read on.  (Image credit: &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/Images/hu_animexp.gif"&gt;Wayne Hu&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/hu_animexp.gif" width="500" title="Look at that photon redshift!" alt="hu_animexp.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let me tell you the underlying assumption behind all of it.  You assume that the Universe is -- on average -- identical in all directions (what we call &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy"&gt;isotropic&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the same everywhere in space (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneity_(physics)"&gt;homogeneous&lt;/a&gt;).  This means that it doesn't matter where you are or what direction you look in; the Universe is the same.  On small scales, like the size of stars or galaxies, this isn't true.  But on the largest scales, like scales larger than galaxy clusters, our observations support this.  Take a look at the observations:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/2dFzcone.png" width="500" title="From the final results of the 2dF galaxy redshift survey." alt="2dFzcone.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as well as at the theory:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/large-scale_structure.jpg" width="500" title="From the Millenium Simulation run by Simon White and his crew." alt="large-scale_structure.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These match up pretty well!  So, with this assumption that the Universe is isotropic and homogeneous, there are two ways to proceed.  You can -- as one option -- choose General Relativity as your theory of gravity, write down the spacetime that describes an isotropic, homogeneous Universe (the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker_metric"&gt;Robertson-Walker metric&lt;/a&gt;), and solve for the equations that govern the evolution of the size and scale of the Universe as a function of time, known as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations"&gt;Friedmann Equations&lt;/a&gt;.  The end result that you get out of that is this relationship between the Hubble expansion rate, &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;, and the energy density of the Universe, &lt;b&gt;ρ&lt;/b&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/15f8400c33bd7efd9acaa8d3e6b4bfd6.png" width="287" title="The most important equation in Cosmology, the first Friedmann equation." alt="15f8400c33bd7efd9acaa8d3e6b4bfd6.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That thing that the Hubble expansion rate equals, &lt;b&gt;å/a&lt;/b&gt;, is just the velocity that an arbitrary point in the Universe moves away from us (&lt;b&gt;å&lt;/b&gt;) divided by the distance to that point (&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the curvature of our Universe, &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;, turns out to be zero, and the cosmological constant, &lt;b&gt;Λ&lt;/b&gt;, is just another type of energy density.  So if we like, we can rewrite this equation in a more simple form:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/friedmann1.png" width="108" height="46" title="The simplified version of the Friedmann equation for our Universe." alt="friedmann1.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the rigorous way to do it, and it's an exercise that every graduate student in cosmology is required to do.  But there's an easier way to do it.  A much easier way, that I'm going to walk you through.  Remember taking physics in high school, and learning about two types of energy: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"&gt;kinetic energy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy"&gt;potential energy&lt;/a&gt;?  In our example here, we're considering an arbitrary point in a homogeneous, isotropic space.  It has both of these types of energy: it's moving, after all, so it has kinetic energy, and gravity is trying to pull everything back together, so it has gravitational potential energy.  Kinetic energy is positive:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/KE.png" width="94" height="25" title="Kinetic Energy" alt="KE.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While gravitational potential energy is negative:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ/GravitationalPE.png" width="124" height="36" title="Gravitational Potential Energy" alt="GravitationalPE.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a &lt;i&gt;flat&lt;/i&gt; Universe like ours -- one with zero spatial curvature -- we have this very interesting property that the total energy of this Universe &lt;i&gt;is also zero&lt;/i&gt;.  This means that if we add up kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy, we get zero, like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;0 = KE + PE,
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;0 = ½ m v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - G m M / r.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Or, I could do a little algebra to cancel out the little m, and make everything positive, in which case I get:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;G M / r = ½ v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That looks okay, but it isn't quite what I want.  I don't really know what this big mass, &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;, is, do I?  Well, I know that mass is equal to density times volume.  And -- if I remember &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law"&gt;Gauss' law for gravity&lt;/a&gt; -- I will recall that the volume I'm interested in is the volume of a sphere.  So I need to replace that mass, &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;, in my equation with this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;M = ρ V&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
where the volume, &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;, is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;V = 4/3 π r&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and so my equation that I got from kinetic and potential energy becomes this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;G (ρ 4/3 π r&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) / r = ½ v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, this looks pretty good!  I'm going to cancel one of the &lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;s from the numerator and denominator, and I'm going to multiply both sides of the equation by 2.  So our equation looks like this now:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt; 8/3 π r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; G ρ = v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hmm.  Looks like we're getting really close!  Let's divide both sides by &lt;b&gt;r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and see what we get:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt; 8/3 π G ρ = v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nice!  The only thing is, instead of having &lt;b&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, we've got &lt;b&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  But hang on.  Remember what I said about what the Hubble expansion rate is?
&lt;blockquote&gt;That thing that the Hubble expansion rate equals, &lt;b&gt;å/a&lt;/b&gt;, is just the velocity that an arbitrary point in the Universe moves away from us (&lt;b&gt;å&lt;/b&gt;) divided by the distance to that point (&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well, &lt;i&gt;that's what we have&lt;/i&gt;, a velocity divided by a distance!  So all we have to do is subsitute in &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; for &lt;b&gt;v / r&lt;/b&gt;, and look at what we've got:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8/3 π G ρ,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
the equation that governs the expansion of the Universe.  And all I need was a little bit of high school physics, geometry, and algebra.  And now &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; know how to do it, too!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/the_math_of_the_expanding_univ.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250243273988"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/clock_quotes_382.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2888c028603af609</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-08-14T09:02:29Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T09:02:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/qxXgNTFVukI/clock_quotes_382.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/clock_quotes_382.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For me the creative process, first of all, requires a good nine hours of sleep at night.

At that point they’ll engage in some quality PDA to show that there’s nothing wrong with kissing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, poorly named Christian groups like the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/13/gay-kissing-is-evil-says-conservative/"&gt;Illinois Family Institute are outraged by it because, according to their director, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/13/gay-kissing-is-evil-says-conservative/"&gt;Laurie Higgins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An adult kissing a pre-pubescent child or a high school-age adolescent in a sexual or romantic manner is both obscene and inappropriate despite the protestations of the North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic or sexual kissing between two consenting adults who are in love and who are closely related by blood is both obscene and inappropriate despite the protestations of defenders of incest to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic or sexual kissing among “multi-partner” unions, like those profiled in a recent Newsweek article, are both obscene and inappropriate despite the protests of polyamorists to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic or sexual kissing between two people of the same biological sex is both obscene and inappropriate despite the voluble, vigorous, and often vitriolic protests of homosexuals to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She must have forgot the whole Pat Robertson “sex with ducks” example. But she goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IFI is not suggesting that homosexual kissing be banned. What we hope is that the public would recover both a proper understanding of the immorality of homosexual acts and the courage to voice that belief, so that public disapproval will be strong enough to persuade homosexuals to voluntarily restrict their kissing to private venues. Many adults do not care to witness obscene and inappropriate kissing, and their children shouldn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many adults do not care to witness obscene and inappropriate invoking of Iron &amp;amp; Bronze Age mythology as a basis for a moral argument, and their children shouldn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like there were at least halfway intelligent distortions last year back when opponents were emphasizing how public health care would lead to waiting on lines for gazillion years. But the lies coming out these days make that long lines hyperbole seem genius by comparison. First there was the completely made up “death panels’ from the person who insisted the media who should “stop making things up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got the &lt;a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=333933006516877"&gt;Investor’s Business Daily&lt;/a&gt; finding a most unusual way to resurrect the old waiting line gambit and persuade Americans of how terrible the health services in the UK are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The controlling of medical costs in countries such as Britain through rationing, and the health consequences thereof, are legendary,” read a recent editorial from the paper. “The stories of people dying on a waiting list or being denied altogether read like a horror script…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn’t have a chance in the UK, where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see that again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hawking wouldn’t have a chance in the UK, where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that extraordinary bit of epic stupidity sink in for one moment as I remind you that Stephen Hawking is from the UK. To their credit, the site has made the correction and left an editor’s note explaining the correction. But that’s kinda the whole point of the article, isn’t it? A rather key example to prove the writer’s point was that Stephen Hawking would be doomed in such a system. . .despite the fact that he clearly is not only NOT DEAD but has thrived in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that perhaps it’s a bigger deal than you had realized. Swine flu is, at least according to the good Doc V.M. Palaniappan, a CAM peddler in Malaysia, a sexually transmitted virus! Oh noes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand firm in my general over-simplification of germ theory advice that you should probably always avoid swapping any bodily fluids with a person infected with any active virus, and take precautions when doing so with a person who carries a dormant, but still contagious, one (such as HIV or HPV or herpes or that Koobface one that got everyone on Facebook a few months ago). However, my well-meaning advice is completely irrelevant to what Dr* Palaniappan (who, because I’m hopped up on pain killers at the moment will for the remainder of this post be referred to as Doc*Pal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc*Pal believes no risk is involved in the hot and steamy, protection-free, one-on-one (or two or three or whatever) action between men and women. Please, feel free to get all tight and shiny under the stairs all night long with your opposite-sex partner. You hetero folk are at no risk of getting the sick piggy up in your parts… unless that’s a new thing kids are doing these days that is unrelated to the H1N1 virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The terrifying, but sexy, truth about how H1N1 is actually spread after the fold) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the pig flu is spread by a far more disgusting and insidious kind of sex – teh gay secks! If only I were being hilarious, I would stop there. But sometimes, truth is far more ridiculous than my happily drugged-up mind could make up right now, so I must go on to tell you that there is yet another way to contract the hamiflu than just sweaty man-on-man action. The other way to get yourself infected is sweaty (or not sweaty) man-on-self action… because, apparently, in the world of Doc*Pal, a person who does not have a contagious virus can pass it to himself by coming into contact with himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid104740.asp"&gt;The Advocate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palaniappan             claims that ”when one masturbates, or indulges in             homosexual       activity, his (her) body develops friction             heat, and that produces acid,       making the body             hyperacidosed, giving burning sensation while urinating             and toileting, and making the person an easy target for H1N1             infection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims that             dry masturbation, which he says ”most men,             irrespective of       their marital status and age,” engage             in, but that it is       “extremely rare among females of             all age groups,” is dangerous       for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He emphasized             that sex between members of the opposite sex was completely             safe. Dr. Palaniappan also suggests coconut water as an             herbal remedy for       the prevention of H1N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, God is not only killing kittens when you self-love, but he is also killing pigs… and by pigs I mean homos and autos… and by autos, I don’t mean cars, I mean masturbationists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in Malaysian CAM school they leave out the part about flu spreading by contact with other people and that you can’t spread  virus you don’t have to yourself… and that you can’t &lt;em&gt;spread&lt;/em&gt; a virus you do have to yourself. And while I’m fairly sure that certain acts do carry a real risk of H1N1 transmission, I’m also fairly sure that your immune system does not care whether the baconfluenza came from the loins of sexy mans or sexy womans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose you could get the flu if someone who carries the flu virus sneezes on your hand and you use that hand to rub one out, so if someone sneezes on your hand, just wash it before you touch your junk (or your mouth or nose or food for that matter). As long as clean hands are involved, whack away, buddy, whack away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advocate does go on to point out this rather disturbing piece of info that gives a little insight into the crazy of Doc*Pal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Malaysia             homosexuality is considered a crime punishable by 20 years             in       jail, caning, and in some states, execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a doctor. I have not consulted any doctors on this issue. I haven’t even pulled up WebMD on this one. But I’m still going to dispense this advice: don’t worry about the swine flu while enjoying the company of another naked erect man… instead try to avoid getting caned and executed. After that, use a condom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a much better plan than Doc*Pal’s to avoid contracting the flu -  human, pig, bird, llama, squid or other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t swap bodily fluids with anyone you know has the flu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a flu shot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra wash your hands if you are in Malaysia… getting caned while sick with the flu is worse than drinking green Nyquil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A result of this impairment is failure on verbally instructed false-belief tasks. However, people with Asperger syndrome, a milder form of autism, seem to pass with flying colors. This presents a problem for the &amp;quot;mindblindness&amp;quot; theory. So do people with Asperger syndrome really have a theory of mind (ToM) contrary to popular theory?Senju, Southgate, White, and Frith decided to take it upon themselves to sort out this confusion. Instead of using verbal instructions, they had adults with Asperger syndrome perform an eye-tracking task that measured the spontaneous ability to mentalize. This entailed subjects to view a scene of an actor first placing a ball into one of two boxes, then having a puppet move the ball to the alternative box unbeknownst to the distracted actor, thus causing a false belief in the actor about the location of the ball. Results showed that the Asperger group showed significantly less looking bias toward the correct window compared to a control group indicating the Asperger group&amp;#39;s inability to spontaneously anticipate others&amp;#39; actions in a nonverbal task. It seems that to a certain extent they do lack a ToM. But then how are they able to pass the verbally instructed false-belief task? The authors suggest that compensatory learning is involved.Senju A, Southgate V, White S, &amp;amp; Frith U (2009). Mindblind Eyes: An Absence of Spontaneous Theory of Mind in Asperger Syndrome.

The faces were standardized according to the so-called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) such that each expression displayed a specific combination of facial muscles typically associated with each feeling of emotion. They then compared how accurately participants read those facial expressions using their particular eye movement strategies.   It turned out that Easterners focused much greater attention on the eyes and made significantly more errors than Westerners did. The cultural specificity in eye movements that they show is probably a reflection of cultural specificity in facial expressions, [Rachael E.] Jack said. Their data suggest that while Westerners use the whole face to convey emotion, Easterners use the eyes more and mouth less.  A survey of Eastern versus Western emoticons certainly supports that idea.  "Emoticons are used to convey different emotions in cyberspace as they are the iconic representation of facial expressions," Jack said. "Interestingly, there are clear cultural differences in the formations of these icons." Western emoticons primarily use the mouth to convey emotional states, e.g. : ) for happy and : ( for sad, she noted, whereas Eastern emoticons use the eyes, e.g. ^.^ for happy and ;_; for sad. In addition to having their eye movements monitored, the participants in the study of Jack et al. (2009) performed a seven-alternative forced-choice facial expression categorization task (i.e., ‘‘happy,’’ ‘‘surprise,’’ ‘‘fear,’’ ‘‘disgust,’’ ‘‘anger,’’ and ‘‘sadness’’ plus ‘‘neutral’’) with same-race and other-race FACS-coded faces.The results suggested that facial expressions are not as universal as Paul Ekman made them out to be:East Asian observers made significantly more errors when categorizing ‘‘disgust’’ (p less than 0.05) and ‘‘fear’’ (p less than 0.001) than Western Caucasian (WC) observers did. In contrast, WC observers categorized all facial expressions with comparably high accuracy.In East Asian participants disgust was most often confused with anger, and fear was mistaken for surprise -- which happened because of their greater focus on the eyes, as shown in the figure below. Eye fixations on the mouth (in red) were less intense for the East Asians compared to the Western Caucasians, which resulted in less accurate discrimination of surprise vs. fear and disgust vs. anger (shown in the red bars in the bottom two panels).Adapted from Fig 1B (Jack et al.) - Color-coded distributions presented on grayscale sample stimuli show the relative distributions of fixations across face regions. Higher color saturation indicates higher fixation density, shown relative to all conditions. Note that the red ‘‘mouth’’ fixations for EA observers are less intense as compared to WC observers across conditions. Color-coded bars to the left of each face represent the mean categorization accuracy for that condition, with red indicating a significant difference in categorization errors between groups. SR = same race, OR = other race.But are Shrink Rap Roy's Psych Notes for Smilies universal across Eastern and Western psychiatrists?

In a new study, Gordon Hodson and colleagues have tested the effectiveness of an unusual alien-themed intervention for reducing homophobia that involves participants taking the perspective of a homosexual person, without really realising that that is what they&amp;#39;re doing.Hodson&amp;#39;s team tested the homophobic tendencies of 101 heterosexual students and then had 79 of them complete the so-called &amp;quot;Alien-Nation&amp;quot; simulation, whilst the remainder acted as controls and attended a lecture on homophobia. For the Alien-Nation task, the students formed groups of four to five members and imagined landing on an alien planet that&amp;#39;s populated by aliens who look exactly like humans, but who don&amp;#39;t allow any public displays of affection, and who live in same-sex housing and reproduce by artificial insemination.The participants answered questions about how they would cope with life on the planet and maintain their lifestyles. They also shared plans for how to behave romantically in secret and how to identify other humans. Research assistants then asked the participants whether the situation applied to any real-life groups. The participants failed to recognise the parallel with homosexuality, but the research assistants pointed out the comparison and drew attention to ways that people who are homosexual deal with the constraints of an intolerant society.A re-test of the participants&amp;#39; attitudes towards homosexuality showed that those in the Alien-Nation group were more able to take the perspective of homosexuals, than were the control participants, and this in turn was associated with more empathy towards people who are homosexual, a greater tendency to think of homosexuals and heterosexuals as all belonging to the same category (being human) and ultimately to more positive attitudes towards people who are homosexual. The Alien condition participants&amp;#39; attitudes also remained more positive compared with controls at one week follow-up.&amp;quot;The Alien-Nation simulation is easily administered, requires no extensive training, and reduces prejudice,&amp;quot; the researchers said.The intervention used in this study is reminiscent of a prize-winning educational DVD called &amp;quot;Homoworld&amp;quot; that was created by the British psychologists Neil Rees and Catherine Butler in 2008. The film depicts a heterosexual couple as they struggle to live in a world dominated by homosexuality._________________________________Hodson, G., Choma, B., &amp;amp; Costello, K. (2009).

However, studies have shown that people in large still dramatically underestimate just how much photo manipulation goes on and still see the images in magazines as fairly accurate representations of what the actual people being depicted look like in reality. This, it is widely believed (though not necessarily proven scientifically), may have played a major role in the rise in the number of female body image issues, which in turn may have led to a rise in the number of eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I find it somewhat puzzling that the folks at so-called &lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/5335022/self-editors-explain-covers-arent-supposed-to-look-realistic"&gt;“Self” Magazine are so nonchalant in the casual admission of their own hypocrisy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt; editors have announced their magazine was right to &lt;a href="http://jezebel.com/5332409/kelly-clarkson-slimmed-down-on-self-via-photoshop"&gt;give Kelly Clarkson a slimmer body&lt;/a&gt; on their September issue, explaining that covers shouldn’t reflect reality, but “inspire women to want to be their best”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We at “Self” Magazine believe in inspiring women to be themselves by dramatically altering the appearance of the already fairly beautiful women that grace our covers and encouraging women to strive to reach an unattainable beauty that doesn’t even really exist on this Earth. We want you to be your “self” so that those appearing in our magazines don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now of course every beauty magazine airbrushes and manipulates their models and celebrities. It’s all just one big lie. That’s not the point here. But I think the author of the article on Jezabel.com explains the problem fairly well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, every magazine cover is altered in some way, but the Kelly Clarkson isn’t controversial just because it was color corrected or even because a few more locks of hair were added to her head: it’s because the editors of &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt; constructed a new body that &lt;em&gt;bears no resemblance to what Clarkson currently looks like&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in response to the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine, Lucy Danziger, admiting to even altering photos of herself to make her hips look smaller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has left an unflattering picture out of a photo album, but that would be analogous to not running a photo of Kelly Clarkson with her eyes closed, not completely reshaping her body. Danziger may have altered her body in her marathon picture, but that just means that she was actually so insecure about her body that she drew herself a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article goes on to include more quotes of Danziger rationalizing misleading her readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I turn to a great quote from the Jezabel article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So even though Kelly Clarkson has said she’s confident at any size and Danziger points out that Clarkson works out and is “as fit as anyone else we have featured in &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt;,” the magazine’s staffers decided having her instantly shed a few pounds would make her look even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; confident and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get hair and makeup. Everyone understands the enormous effects of hair and makeup. And most people even get minor tweaking of photos using computer software. But we’re not talking about the newest Star Wars movie here. If the real-life physical bodies of those appearing in your magazine are going to be completely irrelavent, why not just go full-on Jar Jar Binks and be done with it? Why bother having real people posing in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self Magazine and indeed many other beauty magazines, in addition to selling beauty products that fraudulently give people the impression that those products can make them look like the beautiful people in magazines, are selling the lie that women can achieve an impossible standard and then they feed the public some meaningless platitudes about how they’re just encouraging women to be themselves or be the best version of themselves. But it’s all just a load of shit!&lt;/p&gt;

The exhibit would feature the Christian story of creation. Of course it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal failed for years ago and now Falling’s bringing it back by making it the centerpiece in her campaign, allegedly to honor Jesus. Guess which political party Falling represents? I know you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think a city mayor would have more important priorities in this recession than trying to turn a public zoo into a church like, I don’t know, creating jobs, improving schools, keeping the crime rate down, etc. But let’s hear what Falling has to say about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some may ask why this issue during a Mayoral campaign?  And I say why not?” said candidate Anna Falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not? WHY FREAKIN’ NOT? Well, I don’t know, Anna. Maybe because as a public servant whose supposed to represent everyone in your city and whose salary would be paid for by that diverse public, choosing to favor one religion might send the wrong idea that Christians get preferential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today we are announcing that God will be glorified in this city.  He shall not be shunned. Upon our election, we hereby commit to honoring Him in all ways that He has been dishonored,” said Anna Falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling says God was dishonored four years ago, when the Tulsa Parks Board rejected an exhibit which borrows heavily from the first book of the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, there are no churches in your city? How exactly was your god dishonored? Did the Tulsa Parks Board smack you god in the face with a glove and challenge him to a dual in whihc he then suffered an embarrassing loss? Really Anna, is your god so small and pety that it’s really that easy to dishonor him? You know, there are no displays in public toilets either. Maybe that’s dishonoring your god too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough snark. This is such a blatant violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution that it isn’t even funny.That idiots like this are even allowed to graduate high school is an embarrassment to this country, let alone that she’s been allowed to get this far in politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately though, her party’s primary has about 11 candidates while the &lt;a href="http://www.tomadelson.com/"&gt;State Senator Tom Adelson&lt;/a&gt; from the opposing party has some bi-partisan support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of Anna Falling, all I can say is, ugh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See, I was able to make it through the whole article without a single cheesy pun with her name!)&lt;/p&gt;

Among other things, he was able to follow the ‘Chinese whispers’ or ‘telephone game’ transmission of the news stories by tracking errors that crept into the story as it was published here and picked up there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus science stories can really pick up and spread this way, so although 24 hours after my press release I had only one mention in one paper, after 48 hours this was more than five and another 24 hours later this was more than twenty. One week later it’s up to about fifty and I am still getting new e-mails about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spreading though is especially interesting as between the original press release(s), the paper itself and the blog post (and later interviews) I know which quotes and which information came from where and thus which errors or changes have come in at which stage and which media have picked them up from which other. It is noticeable therefore that one can track errors from report to report as they originate in one and then are copied to others (I tracked a spelling mistake of Tyrannosaurus as Tyrannosaurs across three generations of articles, and each time it appeared in basically the same sentence in the second paragraph of the report, each, theoretically written by a different journalist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shades of pseudogene phylogenies!  Go and read it and enjoy it there, and comment there if you feel moved to do so to encourage him to keep ‘em coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had a pretty cool collective result recently, discovering tiny galaxies that are rapidly forming stars, that they call “green pea galaxies” (which is apparently a different sort of beast from the non-galaxy I called a &lt;a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/explore/obj.asp?id=587728949052506314"&gt;green crayon&lt;/a&gt; in my initial post) — see &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2009/07/29/crowdsourced-astronomy-project-discovers-green-pea-galaxies/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more or &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4155"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the paper itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Galaxy Zoo has just announced a new project, the supernova zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, not only are we classifying galaxies, but we’re hunting supernovae : exploding stars. Images of likely supernova candidates captured by a telescope in California are being fed to our website at &lt;a href="http://supernova.galaxyzoo.org"&gt;http://supernovae.galaxyzoo.org”&lt;/a&gt;.  Astronomers are standing by in the Canary Islands to follow up on the most exciting possibilities, but&lt;br&gt;
first we need your help to decide where to point the telescope. Please take the time to go to the site, read the tutorial – and then start hunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say I love the image of “astronomers standing by”.  I tried it (classifying supernovae, not standing by) —  it’s pretty cool, and actually a bit challenging.  What you actually do is answer a series of questions about a supernova candidate, to determine whether it’s a good candidate or just a messed up image.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an obvious good one:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/08/picture-5.png" title="good SN"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/08/picture-5.png" alt="good SN" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one where the candidate (right image) is distorted so it doesn’t look like a star.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/08/picture-3.png" title="bad SN"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/08/picture-3.png" alt="bad SN" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind it’s not nearly as interesting as the galaxy zoo, because images of galaxies are just way cooler than low-resolution images of supernovae (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_remnant"&gt;supernovae remants&lt;/a&gt; are another story of course).  But it’s a great use of human eyes, and a pretty good way to waste a few lazy August afternoons.  It will definitely be interesting to see if the data is useful enough to help the supernovae followup substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have at it!  Maybe they’ll name the next supernovae “SN2009cosmicvariancereaders”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Risa</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250224049266"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_addendum.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19656659a63c2c5b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">BMI addendum</title><published>2009-08-14T03:15:29Z</published><updated>2009-08-14T03:15:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/oatWguvMeRA/bmi_addendum.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_addendum.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The cupcake wasn't even that good.&lt;/p&gt;

(+)-Angelmarin includes some neat cyclization reactions. They started with Umbelliferone which you can buy, and synthesized angelmarin by way of columbianetin.I&amp;#39;m always curious about where the names of these compounds come from.  The systematic names are probably rather cumbersome, so these common names are useful.  Umbelliferone is found in plants of the Umbelliferae family - which includes carrots. Also named for plant species, angelmarin  was isolated from Angelica pubescens, and columbianetin from Lomatium columbianum.The first cyclization step is a Claisen rearrangement - three bonds all move in a circle, which causes the allyl group to migrate to the aromatic ring.  The resulting ketone tautomerizes to the more stable phenol structure.After an olefin cross-metathesis to introduce two methyl groups, the next step was in effect a double cyclization.  First a stereoselective Shi epoxidation.  Then the epoxide is opened during the second cyclization to form columbianetin.This last cyclization is an an example of a 5-exo-tet cyclization according to Baldwin&amp;#39;s Rules for ring formation.  The resulting ring is a 5-membered ring.  The bond broken to make the new ring is not part of the new ring (exo).  And when the new ring is formed, the nucleophile is forming a bond to a tetrahedral atom (tet).To convert columbianetin into the final product required the formation of an ester.  This proved to be challenging - many standard esterification strategies either did not work, or it caused side reactions that destroyed the columbianetin portion of the molecule.To get around this, they first converted it to a malonate ester under mild conditions.  This was reacted with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and catalytic piperidine to generate the final product by way of a Doebner-Knoevenagel condensation.  In effect building the hydroxycinnamate group instead of adding it as a single piece.Magolan, J., &amp;amp; Coster, M. (2009).

There are still some weeks left of summer. The days are long (though noticeably shorter.) But the windows are filled with back-to-school notebooks and sweaters, and I have a lingering list of things not done, that will either wait till next summer or have to be crammed in these last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/picnic-basket.jpg" alt="picnic-basket" width="400" height="300"&gt;We planned to take Alex to visit his new school — we can still do that a few days before school starts. I wanted Alex to go to the dentist this summer — OK, we’ll make the appointment now and he’ll go in the fall. We haven’t had a picnic since Mother’s Day, mostly because the weather has been uncooperative. Again: a warm September day will be the perfect time for a picnic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have last-minute paperwork to get Alex ready for his sleepaway camp. I now know he doesn’t like it; doesn’t look forward to it; won’t be happy to get on that bus. But he’s going. This has become an annual feature of our summers, the last two years. In my inbox (blush – from APRIL) is an email Jeff forwarded to me from someone who was compiling a survey about kids with special needs and sleepaway camp. The questions all had to do with what Alex gets out of camp…. what he looks forward to…. what he likes best …. how he relates to other campers and counselors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to say it’s a no-go on practically all counts. Jeff keeps saying that Alex is a city guy who doesn’t much like the country, but I think Alex is a boy who is very much at home with his family. He doesn’t like arts &amp;amp; crafts that much. Camp holds very little magic for him, especially compared with the sadness of being torn from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m torn, too. I don’t want Alex to be sad or miss us terribly or feel we don’t want him around. But we need that week, look forward to it all year. What we get out of it is sleep and rest and respite from autism. And maybe that’s why this part of August is so sad for me. It’s unpredictable and unsettled, knowing that while we’re relaxing Alex is crying and missing us. While we’re out having Chinese food, Alex is pushing hot dogs around a plate, noticing how they’re not the kind he eats at home. At the end of our almost-week, we’ll all be happy to see each other again, and then we can finally start the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will &lt;a href="http://www.ktvb.com/news/canyoncounty/ktvba-aug1309-creationism.d7cc4df9.html"&gt;use the Bible as the primary source&lt;/a&gt; for teaching material.  It will be introduced to ninth graders in &lt;a href="http://www.2news.tv/news/local/51789927.html"&gt;western civilization classes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Officials with the yet-to-open Nampa Classical Academy say the Bible will be taught for its literary and historic qualities, as part of a secular education program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School headmaster Val Bush says &lt;strong&gt;students will also explore several versions of creationism&lt;/strong&gt; as part of their studies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless this is part of a mythology class — and I doubt it is — this school is heading down a self-destructing path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As reader &lt;strong&gt;Scott&lt;/strong&gt; points out, I didn’t realize there were multiple ways to say “God did it.”  And evolution isn’t mentioned at all on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/classical-class/Content?oid=1098884"&gt;There’s more&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nampa Classical will teach Latin and Western classics, including the Bible. The school will not teach “certain sex ed,” will eschew anti-American rhetoric and troop bashing and will impart the “good of America, the good of Western civilization,” [founder Isaac] Moffett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers will also discuss where America has failed to live up to its principles, he allowed, without being “presentist,” or judging earlier epochs with modern values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In its proper context, the kids will learn about Native Americans,” said Moffett, who will teach American history and geography. “If we’re talking about westward expansion … you can’t understand why they were conquered so easily without understanding their culture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Columbus will not be judged for introducing disease to the New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In reality, he didn’t do anything, it was a natural consequence of biology,” Moffett said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, they won’t be hiring me anytime soon.  All I teach in my math classes is how to add the bed, subtract the clothes, divide the legs and multiply.  (Ha!  That joke never gets old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And troop bashing?  What public school teachers are currently doing that?  They’re building up a straw man and doing a pathetic job of knocking it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It not only sounds like a push for Christianity, it sounds like a general miseducation of what scholars are actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the people running the school or advising administrators are closely tied with conservative Christian religious groups.  They don’t have a very good track record of separating their faith from the public sphere.  While they profess that they’re following the rules, it shouldn’t be hard to catch them in a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the school will be deemed illegal and shut down before the September 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; opening, but I hope students remember to bring recorders and keep track of what their teachers are saying in the classroom.&lt;br&gt;

They've clearly been distorted (using the "spherize" filter in Photoshop), but in opposite directions. Jim's been "expanded" to make more spherical, while Nora has been "contracted" to look more concave. If you look at these photos for a while, you might have difficulty recognizing how Jim and Nora look normally.

This is an aftereffect. Aftereffects can be experienced in a number of ways, with dizziness being perhaps the most frequently observed -- spin around a few times with your eyes open and the room will appear to be spinning in the opposite direction. Researchers have found a number of different aftereffects in face perception. If you see a lot of spherically expanded faces, then normal faces will start to look contracted. If you look at a face that has the opposite characteristics of Jim's face, then you might think an "average" face looks like Jim.

Two aftereffects can actually be induced simultaneously. If you look at pictures of Caucasian expanded faces and Chinese contracted faces, then normal Caucasian faces will seem contracted and normal Chinese faces will seem expanded. But there is still some transfer between races: If you look at only contracted Chinese faces, then both Chinese and Caucasian faces will seem expanded (though Caucasian faces won't seem as expanded as Chinese faces).

So a 2005 study by a team led by A.C. Little was rather surprising. They found that some face aftereffects did not transfer from one sex to another. For example, if observers saw male faces with wide-set eyes, then normal male eyes seemed narrow-set, but normal female faces just seemed normal. Similar effects were found for masculinized and feminized faces of both genders.

Emma Jacquet and Gillian Rhodes decided to test these findings with a different type of transformation: the expansion and contraction I showed you above.

One of the implications of this theory is that the common ancestor of humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos walked upright, and that knuckle-walking behavior evolved independently in the lineage leading to gorillas from that leading to chimpanzees and bonobos.Figure 1:  Example of the detailed anatomical discussion of the proposed homeotic mutation that lead to the human/great ape backbone structure.   Click on image to see illustration and caption at the book&amp;#39;s website.   (From Reference 3, figure 9-5.)Now, in the advance online Early Edition of PNAS, we find Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor[2] (by Tracy L.  Kivell and Daniel Schmitt), unfortunately behind a paywall, that describes research thoroughly undermining the notion that humans evolved from a knuckle-walking ancestor.   Let&amp;#39;s look at the research first:  ...What Kivell and Schmitt did was examine the &amp;quot;features most commonly thought to reflect knucklewalking behavior in the African ape wrist&amp;quot;, in terms of their occurrence and development in many primates, and especially gorillas as well as chimpanzees and bonobos.   They found &amp;quot;(i) that most gorillas lack key features that have been assumed to be critical for limiting extension of the wrist during knuckle-walking ([refs]), and (ii) these features are found in monkeys that use a variety of different hand postures and substrates.&amp;quot;Assuming that such features are necessary (or highly desirable) for knuckle-walking, we should find them emphasized in gorillas, and at earlier ages, since gorillas are larger, thus putting more stress on the bones of their hands during knuckle-walking, and normally start earlier during development.   Instead:  In addition, the ontogenetic analysis shows that the features of the scaphoid that are assumed to be essential for knuckle-walking ([refs]) are not only inconsistently developed in Gorilla, but, when present, do not appear relatively earlier in development in gorillas (Table 2).  Therefore, using the traditional functional interpretation of these features ([ref]), it would appear that the Gorilla radiocarpal joint may be actually less, rather than more, stable in extension throughout ontogeny compared to Pan. The mention of stability during extension of the radiocarpal joint (bending back the wrist) leads to the next important feature of this report:   the proposal that the method of knuckle-walking used by gorillas is different from that of chimpanzees and bonobos.   We propose that Gorilla uses a relative ‘‘columnar’’ forelimb posture during knuckle-walking in which the hand and wrist joints are aligned in a relatively straight, neutral posture compared to the more extended postures adopted by Pan (Fig.  3).  Animals using a relatively columnar wrist and hand posture would have carpal joints that are in line with the hand and forearm, similar to limb joint position in large graviportal animals such as elephants ([ref]).  Supporting loads directly over more vertically-oriented forelimb joints during support phase explains the absence of posited bony adaptations to bending loads in gorillas and also permits more mobility at the joint ([ref]).  By contrast, Pan, which exhibit extended wrist postures (Fig.  3), will experience higher bending loads.  Thus Pan carpal bones have relatively prominent osteological features that have traditionally, but mistakenly, been interpreted simply as features associated with knuckle-walking in general rather than with a specific posture.  The notion that Pan and Gorilla use different wrist postures is consistent with the morphometric data presented here.  Although this hypothesis has yet to be explored in detail with videographic data, this idea is further supported by previous research showing that Gorilla exhibits increased wrist mobility compared to Pan ([ref]), a more hyperextended elbow joint ([ref]) and relatively equal length of rays 2 through 4, which creates a larger, more stable area over which to disperse axial loads ([ref]).  Imagine the difference between doing push-ups on your fists and on a steel bar you&amp;#39;ve got your hand wrapped around with your wrist bent back.   This is sort of what the difference is, but only sort of.   Unfortunately, their &amp;quot;figure 3&amp;quot; is behind a paywall, but the important takeaway is that there is a difference in mechanism, the details of that difference, while important, aren&amp;#39;t necessary to the wider implications.Kivell and Schmitt have provided very strong support for the idea that knuckle-walking works differently, is used differently, and probably evolved independently in these two lineages.   A less technically oriented discussion (than the paper) is provided by Science Daily[1], I&amp;#39;m not going to try to replicate their work.   (afarensis, FCD is not really convinced, I&amp;#39;ve discussed Filler&amp;#39;s theory in comments on his (old) blog, and I&amp;#39;ve expanded and modified some of my arguments there in this post.)Support for the Upright ApeInstead, I&amp;#39;m going to discuss how this new research relates to the &amp;quot;Upright Ape&amp;quot; hypothesis.   One key hypothesis here is that the homeotic mutation to the spine &amp;quot;pre-adapted&amp;quot; it to support the upper body when standing, walking, or running upright.   I won&amp;#39;t go into the details, but with this adaptation in place, we need to ask precisely why any possessor would go in for knuckle-walking.   The answer is that the requirements of brachiation (swinging from the arms) include suppressing a twisting movement between the hips and the shoulders, a need that grows greater with greater size (mass).   An ancestral &amp;quot;Great Ape&amp;quot; weighing no more than a typical gibbon might have found this movement easy to suppress, but a larger ape that depended on brachiation would have been under some selective pressure to suppress this movement.(Another possibility, IMO, is that the lumbar structure of gibbons has actually become adapted to use the springy structures of the lumbar transverse process (LTP) to provide energy storage from/to this twising moment, which in Great apes must be suppressed by muscular action at the cost of energy.   AFAIK no research has been done into this possibility.   I&amp;#39;ll mention that the springy structures involved are used in most mammals to counter the drop of the belly, allowing it to be suspended during walking and storing energy during running/leaping, while in Great apes it tends to counter the forward droop of the upper body while standing upright (because it has been moved dorsally of the center of flexion (bending) of the backbone by the homeotic mutation).   For more detail, I must refer you to the book,[3] I just don&amp;#39;t have the expertise, and haven&amp;#39;t done the detailed research, to attempt it.   Thus I must also leave my suggestion regarding the gibbons as a possibility, until I find research (if any) into th...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look closely at this picture of Victoria Crater on Mars.  Clicking on the picture will give you a really big file, but a much better look.  There are a number of things you can see in this view of Victoria that you could not see on earlier version because this is a somewhat oblique view. The details are in the press release I reproduce below the fold.  But the other thing you can see that is REALLY FREAKIN' COOL is the mars rover tracks running along one side of the crater!  Go ahead,  see if you can find them!  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/new_very_cool_image_of_vic_cra.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/new_very_cool_image_of_vic_cra.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/C8xvA5jGzrY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250207158050"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-8071726929917986676">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1bdc74df4e413b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Home Smart Home</title><published>2009-08-13T21:48:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T22:28:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/3NClh81QMRw/home-smart-home.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/8071726929917986676/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/08/home-smart-home.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/08/home-smart-home.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SoSPuh5BIHI/AAAAAAAAAEg/77motOyV3W4/s1600-h/main_sarah.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:320px;height:216px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/SoSPuh5BIHI/AAAAAAAAAEg/77motOyV3W4/s320/main_sarah.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fans of SyFy's &lt;i&gt;Eureka&lt;/i&gt; are already familiar with the "character" of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARAH"&gt;S.A.R.A.H&lt;/a&gt;. (Self Actuated Residential Automated Habitat), a literal "smart house" build inside an abandoned fallout shelter that serves as the residence of Sheriff Jack Carter. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;S.A.R.A.H. is an AI that can open and close the hermetically sealed doors, control internal lights and temperature, and make sure Jack has a nice cold beer on tap and a tape of the latest baseball game when he gets home from a hard day's work. In a pinch, she can diagnose injuries and compare current DNA samples against samples on file.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the Comic-Con panel organized by the Exchange and &lt;i&gt;Discover&lt;/i&gt; magazine, series creator Jaime Paglia recalled that when he was first developing the series, he looked into the capabilities of a future "smart home" -- and discovered &lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/technology_news/4216434.html"&gt;they already exist&lt;/a&gt;, albeit not with a built-in conscious AI. For instance, Georgia Tech has the Aware Home, an ordinary-looking two-story house tricked out with all the latest sensing equipment: cameras in the ceiling, microphones in the walls, and invisible trip wires in the doorways.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And now there's even a "smart dollhouse", part of project called InterHome. Per a&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327165.500-smart-house-texts-you-if-theres-a-problem.html"&gt; recent article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;New Scientist:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:18px;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:18px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;times new roman&amp;#39;"&gt;Developed at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, the house is fitted with a network of infrared sensors connected to a central computer. By working out which rooms we tend to occupy at different times, software algorithms learn when we need the lights, heating or air conditioning systems turned on and, perhaps more importantly, when we don't, says Johann Siau, the project's coordinator. ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:18px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;times new roman&amp;#39;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:18px"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;#39;times new roman&amp;#39;"&gt;InterHome also aims to boost home security. By connecting door and window lock sensors to the computer, it can send a text message to the homeowner if they have forgotten to lock the front door, for instance. Texting back will lock any doors or windows in question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Before smart homes become ubiquitous, however, we might want to make sure the AIs behind them don't have S.A.R.A.H.'s rather mercurial temperament. She once locked Carter out when he forgot to call to tell her he'd be late, and when Carter considered leaving the town of Eureka, her abandonment issues kicked into high gear and she locked everyone inside -- using her laser defense system to zap the pizza delivery boy when he tried to escape. Keep your Smart Home happy, people... or else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/y0Fsq2OOZ7g%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-8071726929917986676?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Or, in more familiar terms, someone successfully gets their Ph.D.  The latest elevatee is Lotty Ackerman, my first student here at Caltech.  Lotty’s work is well-known to CV readers; she and I collaborated with Mark Wise on the question of a preferred direction in inflation, which was featured in the series of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/07/30/anatomy-of-a-paper-part-i-inspiration/"&gt;Anatomy of a Paper&lt;/a&gt; posts.  She also worked with Matt Buckley, Marc Kamionkowski and me on the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/10/29/dark-photons/"&gt;Dark Photon&lt;/a&gt; idea.  And she worked with other people on other things, including cosmological &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412007"&gt;density perturbations from reheating&lt;/a&gt; and the more experimentally-oriented question of &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.3998"&gt;asymmetric beams&lt;/a&gt; in the WMAP satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Lotty successfully defended her thesis, and we’ll be sad to see her go.  But California’s loss is Texas’s gain, as she’ll be taking up a postdoc at the new &lt;a href="http://www.tcc.utexas.edu/"&gt;Texas Cosmology Center&lt;/a&gt; in Austin.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
About 70% of Americans agree, either somewhat or strongly, that it's beneficial for women to take her husband's last name when they marry, while 29% say it's better for women to keep their own names, finds a study being presented today at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting in San Francisco.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Indiana University and the University of Utah asked about 815 people a combination of multiple choice and open-ended questions to come up with the findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Hamilton, a sociology researcher at Indiana University and one of the study authors, says that while gender-neutral terms such as "chairperson" have become commonplace, the same logic hasn't carried over to name change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"One of the most interesting things is that a lot of people assume that because language in general is gender-neutral, that name change would also be one of those things in which attitudes would be shifting towards being much more liberal," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she says some studies have found that younger women are as likely or more likely to change their name when they marry as their baby boom counterparts. "It's not a straight age trend."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respondents who said that women should change their names tended to view it as important for establishing a marital and family identity, she says, while those who thought women should keep their own names focused on the importance of a woman establishing a professional or individual identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamilton says that about half of respondents went so far as to say that the government should mandate women to change their names when they marry, a finding she called "really interesting," considering typical attitudes towards government intervention. "Americans tend to be very cautious when it comes to state intervention in family life," she says.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This morning I woke up later than I'd hoped, so I didn't have time to exercise.  I didn't really have time to eat either, but I made myself slow down and have a small bowl of shredded wheat.  I also forgot to bring a snack to the office.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my office neighbor, a cardiologist, had a lunch brought in, as he does every Thursday.  It was, unfortunately, one of my favorites---Star Deli.  If I'd followed my strongest desires, I would have warmed up some of the corned beef and made a corned beef on twice-baked rye with Swiss cheese, cole slaw, and Russian dressing---plus some yummy sides.  As one of my partners said, "Tomorrow, you won't care how good it was."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I picked a thin piece of rye, cut it in half, and put some turkey pastrami on it.  It was yummy, but not as yummy as a big, greasy sandwich would have been.  Thankfully I don't have any blood pressure problems so I was able to enjoy some slices of new dill pickle without (too much) guilt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a between-lunch-and-dinner fruit smoothie (280 cal), which filled me up nicely, and a bite of my friends chocolate bar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner was a chicken ceasar salad with a small amount of vinegar and oil, a hard boiled egg, and a nice piece of ripe cantaloupe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel an order of magnitude healthier than I did a few weeks ago, but changing all of my bad habits is still pretty hard.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_tmi_update.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/uoxVznHXMFM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250202875244"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/quackery_fraud_and_irresponsib.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a967aacdd1a3f7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Absurd medical claims"/><title type="html">Quackery, fraud, and irresponsible practice</title><published>2009-08-13T19:03:52Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T19:03:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/T6_467zeTIA/quackery_fraud_and_irresponsib.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/quackery_fraud_and_irresponsib.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no clear definition of "quackery".  Stephen Barrett, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/quackdef.html"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;, discusses the slippery nature of the definition and the issues of intent and competence.  Defining quackery of necessity involves some subjective judgment, but there are objective parameters we can apply.  If someone is hyping a medical practice without adequate scientific evidence and is profiting from it, they are a quack.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quackery differs from "fraud", which is a legal concept.  In my state health care fraud is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intentional deception or misrepresentation made by a person with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to himself or some other person. It includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicable Federal or State law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, "abuse" is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Provider practices that are inconsistent with sound fiscal, business or medical practices, and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care. It also includes recipient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's harder to nail down is exactly what practices short of fraud and abuse can lead to disciplinary action.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/thoughts_on_dr_rashid_buttar_and_the_fai.php"&gt;As Brother Orac has pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, state medical boards, which are responsible for physician discipline, are problematic institutions, usually willing to give doctors the "benefit of the doubt" when it comes to defining "professionally recognized standards."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what to make of doctors who promote, for whatever reason, patently false health information and practices?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/quackery_fraud_and_irresponsib.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/quackery_fraud_and_irresponsib.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/T6_467zeTIA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250202343747"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5952816283741958316">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b8fa8d33ef07d67</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Greatest possible being?</title><published>2009-08-13T19:33:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T19:58:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/gw16y9z6O3g/greatest-possible-being.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5952816283741958316/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5952816283741958316" title="8 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-possible-being.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">The following argument is valid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.

(Because, like the notion that there is no "best" possible world, there are greater possible beings without limit). &lt;br&gt;4. Therefore, there is no such being as God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This argument is not intended as a proof for the nonexistence of God; rather, it is intended to challenge theists (particularly Christians) to show why the notion of "the greatest possible being that can ever be conceived" is preferable to the view that "beings can be greater without limit." In other words, can (3) to be rejected on the grounds that the notion of “greater beings without limits” is less rational than the notion of “the greatest possible being that can ever be conceived?” If so, how? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5952816283741958316?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It&amp;#39;s a lovely piece of modern day molecular biology doing some forensic work to rediscover a species that was thought to have died out a couple of hundred years ago. The bird in question is the Tasman Booby (Sula tasmani).It has been speculated that this bird has been extinct since around 1790, though evidence has suggested that these birds might still be around. From my reading of the papers, it appears that the call for extinction of the Tasman Booby was based on the examination of fossil material. However the authors believe that the previous study was instead looking at fossil remains of S. dactylatra, the Masked Booby, that were in the upper size range of that species.The authors first performed morphometric data. Their results were presented as follows:Contrary to van Tets et al. (1988), our comparison of new skeletal material revealed a size overlap between modern and fossil specimens for all standard humerus measurements.Such an overlap was not seen by van Tets et al. (see Table 1 reproduced below).So how does that happen? The authors of this manuscript state that van Tets et al. in their studies made a bit of a faux pas. Seems that they &amp;quot;failed to acknowledge&amp;quot; the fact that all the fossil specimens in their study were female, and the modern specimens in their study were male. Like a number of birds, the Booby presents with what is known as reversed sexual size dimorphism. In other words, the females are larger than the males. Whoops.Anywhoo ... Steeves et al. complement the morphometric data with genetic data by performing mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed that mitochondrial DNA extracted from three of the six fossil specimens (nothing was recoved from the remaining fossils) were identical to an existing species of Booby, Sula dactylatra fullagari. Based on this, they proposed that all North Tasman Sea boobies should be known as Sula dactylatra tasmani. With this Steeves et al. have extracted the Tasman Booby from the Book of the Dead!ReferenceSteeves, T., Holdaway, R., Hale, M., McLay, E., McAllan, I., Christian, M., Hauber, M., &amp;amp; Bunce, M.

Neuroscience that reports the existence of mirror neurons in human inferior frontal gyrus (~Broca&amp;#39;s area).  It used a repetition suppression fMRI paradigm and found a suppression effect (different &amp;gt; same) both when subjects executed and then observed the same action and when subjects observed and then executed the same action. This appears to be the best evidence yet for the existence of mirror neurons in humans: an effect was found in both directions, execute--&amp;gt;observe &amp;amp; observe--&amp;gt;execute, and it is showing up in the right place, Broca&amp;#39;s area, the presumed human homologue of monkey area F5.  Another thing I like about this study is that it used object directed actions rather than pantomime which makes it more comparable to the monkey studies.  I haven&amp;#39;t yet read the paper closely. I&amp;#39;d be very interested to hear what folks think, so please post a comment. My only general concern is with the repetition suppression effect itself.  We&amp;#39;ve used it previously and it strikes me as a bit on the sketchy side. The effects are very subtle and susceptible to the boredom critique: the suppression effect is not neural adaptation but instead reflects the fact that the subject is bored with the repetition of stimuli and therefore allocates less attention for same trials versus different trials.  I&amp;#39;m not sure this critique applies here though given that the same trials cross modality.  I&amp;#39;ll have to think about that one.ReferenceKilner, J., Neal, A., Weiskopf, N., Friston, K., &amp;amp; Frith, C. (2009).

A recent study conducted by Teegarden, Scott, and Bale seem to have advanced our understanding of obesity just a bit further. In a 10 day macronutrient choice preference test they found that high fat diet early-exposed mice exhibited a significantly greater preference for a high fat diet as adults measured by daily caloric intake. As a control for diet familiarity mice exposed to a high carbohydrate diet during early life showed no differences in adult macronutrient preferences. Interestingly, although there was increased proportional intake of the high fat diet within the early-exposed mice, there were no differences in total caloric intake or weight gain during the macronutrient choice preference period compared to a control group suggesting that early-exposure seems to impact preference only. The authors explain that the early-exposed mice exhibited significant changes in biochemical markers of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens which altered long-term programming of mechanisms important in dietary preferences and reward.This study makes me think of the countless number of youths I see chowing down at McDonalds. It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that the parents aren&amp;#39;t able to see the bleak distant future of their children; lined up at a drive-through eagerly awaiting that first bite of the savory double cheeseburger and one step closer to developing heart disease.Teegarden SL, Scott AN, &amp;amp; Bale TL (2009).

The level of re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic neuron is crucial and abnormal functioning of the serotonin transporter has been implicated in different neurological diseases. The human 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene transcription is modulated by a common polymorphism in the upstream regulatory region and the short variant of the polymorphism reduces 5-HTT transcription and hence reduces 5-HT uptake by lymphoblasts. In this paper, the authors (Lesch et. al (1996)) report association studies demonstrating that the presence of the short variant pre-disposes the individual towards anxiety related personality traits.Neuroticism scores (seperated into eight groups) and percentages of subjects from L(n=163) and S(n=342)groups in each of the eight T-score groups. Notice that the S percentage is higher than L percentagein all T-score groups above 54 (Lesch et. al (1996))ReferenceLesch, K., Bengel, D., Heils, A., Sabol, S., Greenberg, B., Petri, S., Benjamin, J., Muller, C., Hamer, D., &amp;amp; Murphy, D.

But nonetheless, he is ultimately responsible for the content presented at his museum, and he ought to be deeply embarrassed by this.  Not only does this once again implicitly endorse the racist Hamite theory, but the use of the outdated terms "Negro" and "Mongoloid" are truly cringe-inducing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll reiterate exactly what I said before:  Ken Ham is probably not consciously racist.  However, he is clearly ignorant and intellectually lazy.  He lacks the intellectual curiosity to understand the historical background of the ideas presented in his museum, and the result is major foot-in-mouth moments like these.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2477682075327051123?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250197535557"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/science_blog_carni_seeking_pos.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cca7490758845a6f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Science Blog Carni Seeking Posts</title><published>2009-08-13T21:08:16Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T21:08:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/dbkcggfCH9o/science_blog_carni_seeking_pos.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/science_blog_carni_seeking_pos.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Get me your science post for Scientia Pro Publica, which we are doing on &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/"&gt;Quiche Moraine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;

Some of us, apparently, had stronger stomachs, and went back for &lt;a href="http://www.noguyinthesky.com/2009/08/creation-museums-ape-man-dr-terry.html"&gt;Terry Mortenson's talk later that afternoon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Dr&lt;/i&gt; Mortenson is, I think, one of those people with Ph.D.s of whom Ken Ham is so proud…but man, that guy is freakin&amp;#39; &lt;i&gt;nuts&lt;/i&gt;. He spoke about human evolution, and you can guess where that went. Well, maybe. I wouldn't have anticipated this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. One minute they're telling us that Gawd created humans exactly as they are now, and all those hominin fossils are just apes, and the next, they're telling us &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt; and Neandertal are just Noah's great-grandkids (he had a very complicated family, didn't he?). Consistency is one of those trivial details that gets thrown out when you dismiss human reason, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that we clearly missed a lot of the insanity going on there, I don't think I need to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File this under &amp;quot;Holy crap&amp;quot; — &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/more_stuff_we_missed_at_the_cr.php#comment-1840351"&gt;Jason also attended the lecture&lt;/a&gt;, and look what slide Mortenson showed at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter that they are imputing that imagery to evolution.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My mother has sent me boxes of books that I collected as a teenager, which she has been storing for me rent-free (thanks, Mom!).  One of these boxes contains the first eight or so books from the &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series, of which I was a devoted reader back when I toyed with charismatic evangelicalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am simply torn up about what to do with them. I don’t want to keep them around (because on top of the dubious theology, they are large books and poorly written), but I am also a book lover that won’t throw them away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually in this situation I’d donate unwanted books to Goodwill or sell them to a used bookstore for credit, but the thought of some wide-eyed 14-year-old picking these up and reading them just fills me with dread, partly because I was once that impressionable 14-year-old.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should Sarah do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donate them?  If so, where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dispose of them despite her love of books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest keeping them around, marking them up with your thoughts, and then making the donation to a lovely Christian bookstore.

&lt;p&gt;You may recall that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/04/10/having-a-blast-at-penn/"&gt;I’ve mentioned&lt;/a&gt; my colleague &lt;a href="http://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/m.devlin.html"&gt;Mark Devlin&lt;/a&gt;, his work on the &lt;a href="http://blastexperiment.info/"&gt;Balloon-borne Large-Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST)&lt;/a&gt; experiment, and &lt;a href="http://www.blastthemovie.com/"&gt; the thrilling movie&lt;/a&gt; about it that his brother &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Devlin_(filmmaker)"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; put together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this evening cosmology will get some welcome exposure when Mark will be the guest on &lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/home"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;, airing, as usual, at 11:30pm EST on &lt;a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few friends of the blog have appeared on the show before, and it can be a real challenge to get any information across at all while Colbert is doing his thing (this is a comedy show, after all). But if you can manage it, you’ve got a much bigger audience than we’re used to.

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes feel that I have to apologize on behalf of America to the rest of the planet. What must they think of someone like Anna Falling, &lt;a href="http://www.newson6.com/Global/story.asp?S=10888260"&gt;who is running for Mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; on the platform that &lt;em&gt;there’s not enough religion in government?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some may ask why this issue during a Mayoral campaign?  And I say why not?” said candidate Anna Falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pssst! Someone tell her the answer to &amp;quot;Why not?&amp;quot; is: &amp;quot;The Constitution&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that if you run for any publicly elected office, the only prereq is that you have to read the Constitution and answer a quiz with ten True or False questions on it. Sample questions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Is it OK for the government to endorse only Christianity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Would it be legal to, say, put up a stone monument to The Ten Commandments as the only religious icon in a courthouse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Where exactly in the Constitution does it say this country was founded on Christian principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this part of her website on, &amp;quot;Why Anna?&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now you have likely seen that I have stepped out to run to become Tulsa’s next Mayor.  We believe that we are the candidate to beat for campaign experience and issue strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psssst (again): referring to yourself in the royal first person plural may not instill confidence in the voters. Unless you’re running for 19th century Queen of England. Then you’ve got a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

But what happens after they&amp;#39;ve been established for centuries? A new study in the latest Proceedings of the Royal Society suggests that, in one case, an introduced species has actually become an important part of the native ecosystem -- and helps protect native species from another invader [$-a].

HyperViper.The introduced species in question is the Australian dingo, the wild descendant of domestic dogs [$-a] that moved Down Under with the first humans to settle the continent. Today, 5,000 years after their introduction, dingoes are the largest predator in much of Australia, and they were a prominent part of the ecosystem encountered by European settlers. Europeans, like previous waves of human arrivals, brought their own domestic and semi-domestic animals -- including red foxes, which prey on small native mammals.

The new study&amp;#39;s authors hypothesized that because dingoes reduce red fox activity both through direct predation and through competition for larger prey species, dingoes should reduce fox predation on the smallest native mammals. At the same time, dingoes prey on kangaroos, the largest herbivore in the Australian bush -- and reducing kangaroo populations should increase grass cover, providing more habitat for small native mammals. When the authors compared study sites with dingoes present to sites where dingoes had been excluded to protect livestock, this is what they found: increased grass cover, and greater diversity of small native mammals where dingoes were present.

Recently a news article in Nature discussed ragamuffin earth [$-a] -- the idea that human interference in nature has so dramatically changed natural systems that it may often be impossible to restore &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; ecological communities. In these cases, some ecologists say, conservation efforts might be better focused on how to maintain and improve the diversity and productivity of the novel ecosystems we&amp;#39;ve inadvertently created. It looks as though the dingo could be a poster child for exactly this approach.

In fact, people will be kissing all over the country at that time as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=124199360752"&gt;Great Nationwide Kiss-In&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in response to the gay couples who have recently been arrested for kissing their same-sex partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to show that kissing is not a bad thing, so “bring your husband or wife or partner or boyfriend or girlfriend or good friend” and take a stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the abstinence-only crowd sees this as pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Family Institute is instructing Illinoisans to &lt;a href="http://www.illinoisfamily.org/news/contentview.asp?c=34494"&gt;avoid the Bean&lt;/a&gt; at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  What’s wrong with kissing?  IFI Director &lt;strong&gt;Laurie Higgins&lt;/strong&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
An adult kissing a pre-pubescent child or a high school-age adolescent in a sexual or romantic manner is both obscene and inappropriate despite the protestations of the North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic or sexual kissing between two consenting adults who are in love and who are closely related by blood is both obscene and inappropriate despite the protestations of defenders of incest to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic or sexual kissing among “multi-partner” unions, like those profiled in a recent Newsweek article, are both obscene and inappropriate despite the protests of polyamorists to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romantic or sexual kissing between two people of the same biological sex is both obscene and inappropriate despite the voluble, vigorous, and often vitriolic protests of homosexuals to the contrary.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they’re not against two people kissing… they’re only against it if it involves adults and children, incestuous couples, polyamorous couples (triples?), and gay couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because apparently they’re all alike…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
IFI is not suggesting that homosexual kissing be banned. What we hope is that the public would recover both a proper understanding of the immorality of homosexual acts and the courage to voice that belief, so that public disapproval will be strong enough to persuade homosexuals to voluntarily restrict their kissing to private venues. Many adults do not care to witness obscene and inappropriate kissing, and their children shouldn’t have to.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that makes me wish I had a gay boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that could make this kiss-in even better is if it took place just outside Higgins’ house.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiss-in is a great idea specifically because gay couples kissing in public is a bit unsettling for some to see.  I know I rarely see it in public.  But straight couples do it all the time and it doesn’t faze me at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let them all kiss and let’s hope the event persuades gay couples not to be afraid of doing what straight couples do all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Higgins can do whatever she’d like to with her children.  She might feel more comfortable if each kid came equipped with a blindfold.  She could then tie it around them in case they dare go out in public where (*gasp*) gay people might be engaging in some harmless PDA.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two great classes of phenomena that Darwin set out to explain were those of adaptation– the fit between an organism’s features (structure, behavior, etc.) and its conditions of existence; and unity of type — the similarities of basic structure among organisms in diverse conditions of existence (e.g., the &lt;a href="http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/book.html"&gt;one bone-two bones-many bones&lt;/a&gt; pattern of tetrapod forelimbs, whether they be burrowers, swimmers, climbers, runners, etc.). The unified explanation that Darwin provided for these phenomena was descent with modification: the similarities were due to inheritance from a common ancestor (i.e. descent), while adaptation arose from the process of modification (i.e. natural selection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods of studying adaptation are thus crucial for biology.  How can we tell what (if anything) the spots of the baby tapir are adaptive for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three basic ways of studying adaptation, in the sense of determining what a trait is an adaptation to. The first is engineering: does the feature conform to what we would expect if it is performing some adaptive function?  Study of hydrodynamics enables us to understand the shapes of the bodies, flippers, and fins in fish, dolphins, icthyosaurs, etc. as adaptations to movement within a fluid environment.  The dorsal fin of an ichthyosaur, for example, stabilizes the reptile in its forward movement through water, preventing unwanted roll (for recent discussions of ichthyosaur aquatic adaptations, see &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/171k2010227gj2lp/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/061017_ichthyosaur_fins.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/09/ichthyosaur_skin_impressions.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). For another example of the engineering approach, see Richard Dawkins’ delightful account of &lt;a href="http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery/30297-assignment-discovery-bat-sonar-video.htm"&gt;bat sonar&lt;/a&gt; in chap. 2 of &lt;a href="http://store.richarddawkins.net/products/the-blind-watchmaker-why-the-evidence-of-evolution-reveals-a-universe-without-design-by-richard-dawkins"&gt;The Blind Watchmaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there is the method of correlation (also called the comparative method): does the feature evolve repeatedly in particular environmental circumstances? Thus even if we were wholly ignorant of hydrodynamics, the repeated evolution of dorsal fins in aquatic fish, reptiles, and mammals provides evidence that dorsal fins are adaptations to an aquatic existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="250px-Tigershark3" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/250px-tigershark3.jpg?w=151&amp;amp;h=80" alt="250px-Tigershark3" width="151" height="80"&gt;&lt;img title="800px-Ickthyosaur_MNH" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/800px-ickthyosaur_mnh.jpg?w=154&amp;amp;h=80" alt="800px-Ickthyosaur_MNH" width="154" height="80"&gt;&lt;img title="Orca_dorsalfin_NOAA" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/orca_dorsalfin_noaa.jpg?w=132&amp;amp;h=80" alt="Orca_dorsalfin_NOAA" width="132" height="80"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we can study the effects on survival and reproduction of variations in the trait of interest.  This can be done either by altering the features of the character experimentally (as in this &lt;a href="http://vivaldi.zool.gu.se/Ekologi/Ekologisk%20zoologi%20personal/personal/Malte/malte_andersson.htm"&gt;neat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v299/n5886/abs/299818a0.html"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt; on sexual selection in widowbirds) or by studying naturally occurring variants (as was done with &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=darwins-missing-evidence"&gt;peppered moths&lt;/a&gt; by  &lt;a href="http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/jim/pap/malletpeppered04.pdf"&gt;H.B.D. Kettlewell&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence for the adaptiveness of spotting/striping in mammals is primarily of the first sort (Hugh B. Cott, in his classic &lt;em&gt;Adaptive Coloration in Animals&lt;/em&gt;, has a lot about optical principles, and what makes things hard to see), the second sort (pacas, bongos, deer, tapirs all have spots and/or stripes [and note that pacas are rodents, and that tapirs, which are perissodactyls, are not at all closely related to the artiodactyl deer and bongo, so it would be hard to argue it&amp;#39;s a retained ancestral feature]), and very little of the third sort– no one’s painted baby tapirs’ spots over to see what happens to them (at least as far as I know). I’ll touch on all three sorts as they relate to tapirs in later posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For other examples of camouflage, see Matthew Cobb’s &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/the-wonders-of-camouflage/"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that bit of sadness, however, this has been an exciting week. Carrie and Rebecca ignited a great discussion with an interview on the Novella Family Variety Hour podcast about gender in skepticism. The discussion subsequently spilled over to &lt;em&gt;Skepchick, a&lt;/em&gt;nd for the past few days it’s been a great, very intelligent, mostly civil dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, I’m a dude. Okay? I’m a guy, and I work here with all women. Don’t get me wrong. I love being the only guy here. Contributing to &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; is the epitome of awesome. It’s extra strength awesome. It’s awesome with cheese on it. But this topic can stop me in my tracks. Not because I don’t understand the issue. I think I do. But sometimes I hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I’ll offer my opinions, and my thinking is pretty much in line with the other contributors, but because I’m the only guy and because gender inequality hasn’t really affected me negatively, I still feel a bit like an outsider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In what situation(s) do you feel like an outsider? Is it ever a problem or do you relish being different?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not sure I believe that, but it is what I'm told. But to me the three button mouse on a Mac represents one of interesting cultural features of Mac users.  Years go, when I was arguing with my friend Mike about which was better,. Windows or Macs (Linux was not really an option at the time), he kept insisting that Macs were better for all sots of reasons.  After he listed a long list of made up (I assume) reasons that Macs were better, I said to him: "Mike I've got three words for you that make all that irrelevant.  'Three button mouse'.  A Mac doesn't even have two buttons.  I love right clicking on things.  I love middle clicking on things. I love using all sorts of combinations of clicking on tings"  ...

That happened because she disseminated information about an upcoming talk that would likely be critical of creationism.  She was fired because the TEA (hee hee he said .... "tea") claimed a "neutrality" policy and claimed that Chris had broken the policy.  Her reference, via email, to the upcoming talk was an endorsement of ... OMG!  Evolution! Evolution over Creationism!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes folks, you read that right.  Chis Comer was effectively fired from her job as director of Science of the TEA because she gave the vaguest hint that she supported evolution over creationism.   I'm sure you already know that story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, she sued, and the court in which she sued ruled against her because that court did not feel that her claim ... that the TEA had violated the establishment clause ... was valid.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, this is a tricky one.  The court ruling against her in this case did not mean much regarding church and state or evolution vs. creationism.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Chris Comer has filed an appeal in the US Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit.  The appeal was filed on August 6th and asks for ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...review the record de novo and reverse and vacate the district court's decision. Specifically, it should grant Comer's motion for summary judgment, and vacate the grant of summary judgment for defendants, as well as the dismissal of plaintiff's complaint. At a minimum, this Court should vacate the grant of summary judgment to defendants, plus the order dismissing the complaint, and remand for further proceedings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consequently, anxiety and insomnia (sleeplessness) have become quite common. No wonder, we are using anxiolytics and sedatives more often; to get relief from the anxiety and insomnia respectively.Benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium), chlordiazepoxide (Librium) can effectively treat anxiety and insomnia. They do so by binding with a receptor (called Benzodiazepine-GABAa-chloride ion channel complex [henceforth to be referred to simply as GABAa receptor]) in nerve cell membranes. It is known that most drugs (medicines) exert their actions by combining with receptors: macromolecular complexes present in the cell membrane or within the cytosol or the nucleus.The GABAa receptor is a very versatile receptor complex (a hypothetical model is shown at the bottom). Its main action is to inhibit transmission along neurons in which they are present. Normally, proper functioning of the brain is ensured by a balance between the action of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters [henceforth to be referred to simply as NTs]. Simply put, excitatory NTs (for example, glutamate) give a green or go signal; while inhibitory NTs (such as GABA) tell the nerve not to fire (red or stop signal). In this connection, it must be said that GABA (gamma amino butyric acid) is the most important inhibitory NT. When GABA binds with the GABA receptor ionophore complex, the receptor changes shape (conformation); and then a centrally located chloride channel, that is a part of the receptor itself, opens. Since the concentration of the chloride ions (Cl-) is much more on the outside of the cell than on the inside, Cl- now rushes in due to the increase in chloride conductance. The cell voltage goes further down and the interior of the cell becomes more negative (hyperpolarized) with respect to the outside. The cell becomes less excitable and is thus inhibited.Apart from maintaining the much needed critical balance already mentioned, they also ensure that the brain works in a relatively noise free environment. Billions of neuronal units are always firing in the background creating a constant ‘noise’. A constant release of GABA by the brain drowns out this noise thus improving the ‘signal to noise’ ratio, making the brain’s task of finding the proverbial ‘needle in a haystack’ a lot easier.The GABAa receptor not only binds with GABA, but it is a binding site for various other ligands. But before we discuss them, let us briefly analyze its structure first. The receptor has a pentameric structure which means that it consists of five subunits, and each subunit has four membrane-spanning (transmembrane) domains (see picture). And there are many of the polypeptide subunits to choose from a vast array consisting of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, pi, rho and so on. (In addition, there are six different forms of alpha, 4 beta and 3 gamma subunits). Thus, it’s no wonder that a great variety of GABAa receptors will be found, given the possible permutations!This receptor heterogeneity explains actions of various pharmaceuticals on the receptor. One major form of GABAa receptor (found throughout the brain) consists of two alpha1, two beta2 and one gamma2 subunits. In this isoform, GABA ‘somewhere’ between alpha1 and beta2 subunits, and benzodiazepines bind with the BZ1 (also called omega1) pockets located between alpha1 and gamma2 subunits. Benzodiazepines act only when the receptor isoform has one of the following alpha subunits: 1, 2, 3 or 5 and the subunit should have a conserved histidine residue in the N-terminal domain. In ‘knock-in’ mice where histidine has been replaced by arginine in the alpha1 subunit (alpha1H101R; H for histidine and R for arginine in the 101st residue of alpha1 subunit) there was no sedation or amnesia (as evidenced by their unchanged ‘energy’ and memory to electric shocks). It may be mentioned at this moment that the so called ‘date rape’ pills exploit the amnestic properties of benzodiazepines. The drug plays tricks with the victims’ memories. However, the anxiolytic and muscle relaxant properties were retained in these mice.These mice also do not respond to the hypnotic effects of zolpidem and zaleplon, non-benzodiazepines that act at GABAa receptors containing alpha1 subunits. But in mice with selective histidine arginine mutation in the alpha2 subunit of GABAa receptors, resistance to the antianxiety action of benzodiazepines has been seen. Based on these observations, it is thought that alpha1 subunit mediates sedative and amnestic effects, while alpha2 takes care of the anxiolytic and muscle relaxant ones. It also seems that we are poised to make better benzodiazepines in future (like one that works in anxiety but doesn’t wreak the patients’ memory).Lastly, the versatility. The GABAa receptor also binds barbiturates (urea derivatives used as anesthetics, anticonvulsants, Marilyn Monroe supposedly died of its overdose) in addition to the benzos. Alcohol, alphaxolone (a steroid anesthetic), etomidate (a short acting anesthetic), propofol (diprivan, Michael Jackson supposedly used it), volatile anesthetics like halothane, anticonvulsants like gabapentin and vigabatrin, anthelminthics like ivermectin, and neurosteroids (metabolites of androgen and progesterone) exert part or all of their actions by acting through this receptor, thereby hyperpolarizing the neuron. Conversely, convulsants picrotoxin blocks the chloride channel directly, while bicuculline blocks the receptor’s GABAa binding site causing depolarization and convulsion. There&amp;#39;s a lot more than this mere exegesis, and I hope to discuss about it furher later.Last modified: neverReference: Bertram G.

&lt;p&gt;This is also the first in what I hope will be a long series of interviews with researchers in my field of Chronobiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://bioinf.itmat.upenn.edu/hogeneschlab/" title=""&gt;John Hogenesch&lt;/a&gt;, my chronobiologist colleague who moderated the 'Community intelligence applied to gene annotation' session at ScienceOnline'09, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Pharmacology.  Our lab works on clocks, but also on functional genomics in mammals.  I did my graduate work in neuroscience at Northwestern University at the Chicago campus with Chris Bradfield.  In Chris's lab, I worked on identifying and characterizing new members of the bHLH-PAS class of transcription factors -- several of these orphan PAS domain proteins ended up being Bmal1, its paralog Bmal2, and Npas2, core components of the E-box machinery of the clock.  For my postdoctoral training, I joined the lab of Steve Kay at the then developing Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation.  Later , I started my own lab there focusing on functional genomics and became Director of Genomics.  These research projects included circadian clock research, but also other areas of biology that were of interest to me or GNF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did it happen that you became a scientist? How did you end up in chronobiology?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a second-generation scientist, my dad is professor of chemistry at the University of Southern California.  My mom also teaches at USC, and my brother is a political science professor at Cal State Northridge.  So, you could say that science/academia is in the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up interested in chronobiology largely based on a lecture in the first year graduate school by Joe Takahashi.  Joe gave this fabulous lecture covering the progress of the Drosophila clock field in the fall of 1992, and I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job? What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real life job is the complicated life of academic science.  Teaching, mentoring, sitting on study section, running a research group, being involved in graduate groups, sitting on committees, writing grants, and, time permitting, writing papers.  (Oh yeah, I have twin one-year-old boys and a five-year-old to occupy my remaining day and night.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what I will be when I grow up.  I view science as a career of continual development.  I started my research career mining genome data for new bHLH-PAS proteins (informatics).  Then I cloned and characterized them -- molecular and cellular biology.  Then I became a genomicist, and learned a lot more about bioinformatics.  I'm not really sure what will come next, but I hope to continue to learn how to do new things and apply them to subjects I'm interested in such as the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you explain to my lay audience, what your research is all about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research involves learning how the clock works.  In humans, the clock is actually your whole body, as clocks are everywhere, not just in your brain.  There are really three facets of circadian clock function -- synchronizing with your environment, keeping time, and regulating physiology and behavior.  We are working on all three of these issues to various extents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="John Hogenesh pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/John%20Hogenesh%20pic.jpg" width="331" height="303" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I call myself a first generation Atari American -- I've spent most of my life around computers.  Because of that, I probably see more opportunities than most people to exploit information technology, bioinformatics, and the Web.  I use it to manage my own personal communications -- I'm big into Gmail and Google voice.  I use tools such as Basecamp, project management software, to keep track of how things are going in the lab and collaborate with other laboratories.  We dabble in computational approaches in the lab, occasionally more than dabble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 years or so ago, I listened to David Botstein when he began advocating for open science and the release of large data sets.  It was obvious -- if you collect information on 10,000 genes, but only follow up one or a few, it's really a shame to let the remaining data lie fallow.  It occurred to me that a good way to avoid this would be to publish data and make it available.  Again pretty obvious.  However, depositing data in a database is not enough to ensure that it is used.  In 1998, Rusty Thomas, a colleague in the Bradfield lab, and I put together a gene expression database to enable end-users, not card-carrying computational biologists, to explore large toxicology data sets.  When I got to GNF and had the resources to do something like this at scale, I jumped at the chance.  With an extremely talented graduate student, Andy Su (now director of computational biology at GNF), we built the Gene Atlas/Symatlas, a repository of multiple tissue expression data for human and mouse genes.  This resource has been highly used by the research community.  I thought, if this works for tissue specific gene expression, which was a peripheral interest of mine, it should work just as well for circadian data.  So we built the first circadian expression databases.  Now, we're putting up other large-scale data sets such as siRNA screens.  When tens, dozens, or hundreds of labs are using your resources, good things will come of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web and technology to exploit it have changed, but the basic principle of open science has not.  Papers associated with these databases are read more, the data sets are used more, the papers are cited more, it's win-win.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are involved in a number of initiatives involving Wikipedia and gene annotation online - can you tell us more about these?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My foray into gene annotation efforts really began with the Gene Atlas.  The Web isn't static, though, and other opportunities emerged.  One of these was Wikipedia.  We noticed that the canonical gene annotation efforts at NCBI were understaffed -- one person ran Locus Link.  Andy thought , why not apply community intelligence, which generated a resource to rival Encyclopaedia Britannica, to gene annotation efforts?  I agreed.   Again, if something like this is going to happen on a genome scale, I'll do my best to make sure that the circadian clock community benefits first.  Now, if you go to Google and search a clock gene such as Bmal1, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/10/wikipedia_just_like_an_organis.php" title=""&gt;the first link that comes up is&lt;/a&gt; the Arntl entry in Wikipedia.  When a clock rookie looks at the circadian gene, they go to its Wikipedia page, an archive and evolving review paper, to learn about it.  That's a fact.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second recent development is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/biogps.gnf.org/circadian" title=""&gt;BioGPS&lt;/a&gt;, a descendent of the Gene Atlas and SymAtlas.  It handles gene synonyms, but more importantly, it allows one to use lightweight methods, URL-based, to aggregate and visualize gene-based data sets.  This is the technology we use to build the siRNA screening database. We put our data in there, but also linked this cell based screening data to gene expression data sets (circadian and multiple tissue expression), annotation efforts at NCBI and Wikipedia, and the UCSC genome browser.  The really cool aspect of it, though, is that it's customizable.  If you want to add a new data set, you can, or you can link to one of the 100+ plug-in data sets with a couple of mouse clicks.  A customized gene portal with your favorite data in a couple of minutes for free. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't currently blog.  It's not that I'm opposed to it, it's just that I have my hands full.  I do use Facebook, but mostly to keep up with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a trick question? Yours of course.  When I can, I also tune into &lt;a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/" title=""&gt;Mike Eisen&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow baseball and genomics enthusiast, and &lt;a href="http://biogps.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Andy Su&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy and I had a long discussion with &lt;a href="http://mndoci.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Deepak Singh&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon on their Web Services platform (AWS).  It's two things, storage and compute power -- you buy what you need when you need it.  I came back to Penn and began advocating for testing these platforms out on our own data.  Even big institutions such as ours have problems with access to compute clusters.  We are already exploiting AWS for proteomics work, and beginning to do the same now for genomic data -- Steven Salzberg at the University of Maryland has pioneered some of these ideas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My summary:  at this point, if you use north of 70% of your CPU cycles, you're probably better off buying your own.  If you use less than 50%, AWS already makes sense, and much below that, I would argue it's a no-brainer.  There are some problems -- you have to code in a particular way, data transfer costs can add up, but these things can be mitigated and Amazon is working hard to do so.  Why buy expensive hardware, maintain and service it, and compete for high-priced IT talent, when Amazon already does that better than academia ever will?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the molecular biologists in the audience, it's sort of like buying a polyacrylamide gel rather than pouring one.  Until I told people in the lab about eight years ago, no more pouring page gels.  It's time-consuming, which is money consuming, and I would rather have them do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winners of the &amp;quot;Capture the Universe&amp;quot; astrophotography contest have been announced and &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/photos/11-great-astro-pics-winners-celestron-discover-contest/"&gt;are now up for your viewing&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I suppose that may need some explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/photos/11-great-astro-pics-winners-celestron-discover-contest/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/celestron_holmes.jpg" alt="Celestron contest image of Comet Holmes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In June, Discover Magazine and Celestron announced a contest for people to submit their best pictures of the sky using Celestron equipment. For a judge they wisely chose an experienced and seasoned astronomer, skilled in the arcane arts of astrophotography and critical analysis of aesthetics… oh wait, no they didn’t, they asked &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest ran all month, and in the end there were over &lt;strong&gt;150&lt;/strong&gt; pictures entered. It was very tough making the choices! For example, there lots of incredible images of galaxies, but I didn’t want five out of the top ten being all of one kind of object. I tried to spread it around, but even then it was difficult choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I finally made my decisions, and the Top Ten (actually 11, because I’m a wuss and ran two images tied) &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/photos/11-great-astro-pics-winners-celestron-discover-contest/"&gt;are now on display&lt;/a&gt; in a gorgeous gallery of galactic, uh, gorgeousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/photos/11-great-astro-pics-winners-celestron-discover-contest/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/celestron_winnerstrip.jpg" alt="Celestron contest image strip of entries"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My congrats to the winner, who will receive a Celestron NexStar 8SE computerized telescope, a very nice prize that makes me very, very jealous! I’d also like to thank very much the fine folks at Celestron and of course &lt;del&gt;The Hive Overmind&lt;/del&gt; Discover Magazine for running this contest and allowing me to judge it. It was an absolute pleasure to go through so many beautiful images of the night sky, even though it was torture picking the best ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing all these entries reminds me that astronomy has come a long, long way in the past few years. Equipment that is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; affordable allows people to make incredibly beautiful and astonishing pictures of celestial objects, images that even a couple of decades ago were only possible from professional astronomers using large observatories. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250185369265"><id gr:original-id="http://bhascience.blogspot.com/2009/08/are-you-spiritual.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7a0550629db4815</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Are you spiritual?</title><published>2009-08-13T03:51:42Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T03:51:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/BtP_jfNZTS0/are-you-spiritual.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://bhascience.blogspot.com/2009/08/are-you-spiritual.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Most people have got a reasonable idea of what&amp;#39;s meant by the word &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39;, even if it&amp;#39;s hard to tie down precisely. But what about &amp;#39;spirituality&amp;#39;? It&amp;#39;s an important question because there&amp;#39;s an increasing body of research into spirituality, rather than religion.

The concept of &amp;#39;spirituality&amp;#39; is used in these studies specifically to get away from the idea that religion is the be-all and end-all in terms of personal fulfilment, happiness, and health. Surprisingly, however, the two are then often bundled together as a conglomerate. When describing their research, you often hear something like: &amp;quot;Religion/spirituality is helpful in...&amp;quot;

Take, for example, a recent study into the outcome of drug treatment. The authors, Brad Conner and colleagues from UCLA, looked into whether religious and/or spiritual patients responded better to a treatment programme using drug substitutes (e.g. methadone)....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Some theorists have even gone so far as to argue that language and logical thought are one and the same thing. A new brain imaging study challenges this notion by showing that logical inferences based on simple &amp;quot;not&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;or&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;if&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;then&amp;quot; terms activate a separate, though overlapping, network of brain regions compared with logical inferences based on grammatical judgements.Martin Monti and colleagues scanned the brains of fifteen participants while they judged the accuracy of conclusions flowing from two kinds of logical argument. One kind was a more pure form of logic, such as &amp;quot;If both X and Z then not Y&amp;quot;, whilst the other kind was based on grammatical rules, such as &amp;quot;It was X that Y saw Z take&amp;quot;. The two types of inference were intended to be of comparable difficulty and to be equally valid (or invalid) but crucially only the grammatical version involved the interpretation of language-related roles such as &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot;.As expected, inferences drawn from the grammar-based logic activated a swathe of brain regions usually associated with language functioning, including the Wernicke-Broca circuit, as well as other regions associated with working memory and executive functioning. Judgements about the purer logical arguments also activated regions associated with memory and mental effort, but did not activate the core language areas of the brain. Instead, the grammar-free logical problems triggered activity in prefrontal regions previously associated with logical reasoning.Monti&amp;#39;s team said their findings were hard to reconcile &amp;quot;with the claim that language and logic are a unitary phenomenon&amp;quot;. Rather, they argued their results are consistent with language and logic being separate processes. The grammar-based statements appeared to be solvable using language networks of the brain, whilst purer logic was dealt with by a distinct neural network not dependent on language. The researchers concluded that their work supports earlier findings by others. For example, it&amp;#39;s been shown that it is possible to have numerical concepts without the words for those concepts .  The new and old findings together show that &amp;quot;much of thought is not embedded in language&amp;quot;, they said._________________________________Monti MM, Parsons LM, &amp;amp; Osherson DN (2009).

it's the cutting edge"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inventor and futurist &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil"&gt;Ray Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt; has been described as "the restless genius" by the Wall Street Journal, and "the ultimate thinking machine" by Forbes. And for good reason: Kurzweil was the principal developer of the first CCD flat-bed scanner, the first omni-font optical character recognition, the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind, the first text-to-speech synthesizer, the first music synthesizer capable of recreating the grand piano and other orchestral instruments, and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. His &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/index.html?flash=1"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has an audience of over a million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="kurzweil1.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/kurzweil1.JPG" height="200"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Among Kurzweil's many honors, he is the recipient of the $500,000 MIT-Lemelson Prize, the National Medal of Technology, and in 2002 was inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame. He has received nineteen honorary Doctorates and honors from three U.S. presidents.&lt;br&gt;
Ray has written &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;search-type=ss&amp;amp;index=books-uk&amp;amp;field-author=Raymond%20Kurzweil"&gt;six books&lt;/a&gt;, four of which have been national best sellers. Ray's latest book, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Singularity-Near-Raymond-Kurzweil/dp/0715635611/ref=sr_1_2/279-7337008-7792022?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250153757&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;The Singularity is Near&lt;/a&gt;, was a New York Times best seller, and has been the #1 book on Amazon in both science and philosophy. Wow!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So clearly it's with a great deal of excitement that I find myself in possession of a world exclusive: Ray Kurzweil's foreword to the "&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.filminfocus.com/focusfeatures/film/9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;", the upcoming Shane Acker / Tim Burton animation. In this, Kurzweil discusses the film's dark vision of the future and compares it with his own predictions, identifying the progress we need to make if we are to create successful thinking machines. In a nutshell - it's not our tool-making abilities or rational intelligence that makes us superior, it's our capacity to feel emotion, to form social bonds and collaborate as a group. We don't just need machines that are smart - we need ones that care.&lt;br&gt;

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter continues to send back very cool imagery of the Moon. Check it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/377591main_CraterString_20090810_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2489/3816138192_059b183e07_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to embiggen]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc_20090810_craterstream.html"&gt;This is a classic crater chain&lt;/a&gt;, a linearly laid-out set of craters about 4.5 km (3 miles) from end to end. These appear all over the solar system, pretty much whenever you have a large object with no atmosphere like a moon (or Mercury). There are two potential causes of these: an asteroid or comet that broke up due to gravity prior to impact, or material ejected from a large impact some distance away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first case you usually need something big to break up the incoming object, like the way Jupiter’s tides tore apart comet Shoemaker Levy 9 which slammed repeatedly into the big planet back in 1994. It’s possible this could happen with the Moon, but unlikely because its gravity is weak (and while the Earth could do it, the object would then be more likely to hit the Earth and not the Moon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno_%28crater%29"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/giardanobruno.jpg" alt="Giordano Bruno crater on the Moon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this chain seen by LRO is probably the second kind, material splashed out when crater formed nearby. It turns out that there is a likely suspect: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno_%28crater%29"&gt;Giordano Bruno&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a medium-sized crater about 20 km (14 miles) across, located just over the limb of the Moon on the far side. As you can see by this picture, it’s surrounded by bright rays, linear features from plumes of material arcing out of the crater when it formed. That’s encouraging; you’d expect to see this kind of ejected material if the event formed crater chains farther away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the bright material around Giordano Bruno, and lack of craters superimposed on it, means it’s young, probably less than a few hundred million years old (which is downright sprightly for a crater on the Moon). The same can be said for the crater chain; the craters making it up appear relatively fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this isn’t conclusive, it’s interesting, and pretty good evidence that the two features are related. Either way, the chain is pretty interesting. The largest crater at the bottom is about 340 meters (1100 feet) across, so it’s roughly the size of a big mall’s parking lot. The blur of material below the chain in the picture may be due to material splashed out and disturbing the lunar surface when the craters were formed themselves, meaning they probably hit at a low angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Giordano Bruno is located north of this chain, up past the top of this picture. That means this chain formed roughly perpendicular to the direction of the primary event. And since the largest crater is to the right, and they get smaller as you go left, I’m thinking that a big chunk of rock was pulverized when Bruno was made, and went flying south at a low angle along with a pile of debris. They all splashed down here, 500 km (300 miles) south of Bruno, making this weird formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most amazing things about our Moon is how the geology is laid out; even millions or hundreds of millions of years after the fact, like forensic scientists we can trace back what happened and put together a story of the events. Is this particular story correct? Maybe, maybe not. But the best way to find out is to keep looking, find more evidence and build up more tales. LRO is doing just that, and more missions down the line will give us even more narrative voices. Eventually, we may have a novel with thousands of chapters, and — if I may contradict the Bard — it will be full of sound and fury, signifying everything.&lt;/p&gt;

He also blogs at &lt;a href="http://blog.thehumanist.com/"&gt;Rant &amp;amp; Reason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My organization, the Secular Coalition for America, is sending me to Netroots Nation this weekend in Pittsburgh.  I have to miss the first day – it starts on a Thursday – but it should be an exciting trip.  I just had to change to an earlier flight for tomorrow because otherwise I would miss an interesting panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/node/1105"&gt;A New Progressive Vision for Church and State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Friday, August 14th 1:30 PM – 2:45 PM&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Panel, 318&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old liberal vision of a total separation of religion from politics has been discredited. Despite growing secularization, a secular progressive majority is still impossible, and a new two-part approach is needed—one that first admits that there is no political wall of separation. Voters must be allowed, without criticism, to propose policies based on religious belief. But, when government speaks and acts, messages must be universal. The burden is on religious believers, therefore, to explain public references like “under God” in universal terms.&lt;strong&gt; For example, the word “God” can refer to the ceaseless creativity of the universe and the objective validity of human rights.&lt;/strong&gt; Promoting and accepting religious images as universal will help heal culture-war divisions and promote the formation of a broad-based progressive coalition.  (emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been discredited?  That’s quite an assertion to make, but then again, I don’t know what they mean.  I don’t think even they know what they mean by it, but hopefully I’ll find out tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, they seem to be willing to play fast and loose with words.  If they’re willing to say &lt;em&gt;“‘God’ can refer to the ceaseless creativity of the universe and the objective validity of human rights”&lt;/em&gt; they must have no idea what they’re talking about.  It’s pathetic.  But they shouldn’t be offended!  They can just tell themselves that “pathetic” can refer to “brilliant”! (How many of you didn’t see that one coming?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These “culture-war divisions” aren’t trivial matters of semantics to be smoothed over with definitions.  We honestly disagree on many points and in our overall worldview.  I doubt that Senator DeMint, for example, wants “In the Ceaseless Creativity of the Universe We Trust” carved into the Capital Visitor’s Center.  It’s a genuine disagreement about what IDEAS – not just words – are acceptable for the government to endorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the current state of politics, which bears uncanny resemblance to Through the Looking Glass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;div style="border:1px"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px;float:right" title="Humpty Dumpty and Alice" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Humpty_Dumpty_Tenniel.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="260"&gt;`And only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; for birthday presents, you know. There’s glory for you!’ [said Humpty Dumpty]`
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what you mean by “glory”,’ Alice said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. `Of course you don’t — till I tell you. I meant “there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!”‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`But “glory” doesn’t mean “a nice knock-down argument”,’ Alice objected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`When &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, `it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`The question is,’ said Alice, `whether you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make words mean so many different things.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words “No God” were large, front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v5202/211/11/577267278/n577267278_3632051_1217326.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v5202/211/11/577267278/n577267278_3632051_1217326.jpg" title="DerekRodgers" width="560" height="420"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(pic via &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/2009/08/derek-rodgers-expelled-from-ken-hams-theme-park-of-ignorance/"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek was told by museum staff to turn his shirt inside-out, and he did.  Later, he was telling some friends in the museum gift shop that he wouldn’t buy anything because he didn’t want to give the museum any more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A family overheard this and complained to museum staff, saying that Derek “ruined their vacation.”  (That’s funny.  Seeing the exhibits in the museum ruined mine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Looy&lt;/strong&gt; (below, background) confronted Derek and told him to leave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/expelled_from_the_creation_mus/looy_rodgers.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/expelled_from_the_creation_mus/looy_rodgers.jpeg" title="DerekRodgers2" width="400" height="613"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looy also kicked out a documentary film-maker who captured all this on tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looy’s actions were unwarranted but I suppose he needed to save face.  300+ atheists were there and not a single incident?!  That would be horrible for PR!  Perhaps Derek was just a scapegoat for the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, they made another mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looy confronted Derek in front of a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/evodevo_mike/3800249719/"&gt;green background&lt;/a&gt;.  And as anyone who watches &lt;em&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/em&gt; knows, you don’t do that unless you want someone to change the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which reader &lt;strong&gt;Chuck&lt;/strong&gt; did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/He-Sees-You.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/He-Sees-You.jpg" alt="He Sees You" title="He Sees You" width="317" height="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s why Derek came out of this situation looking so good.  He had His Holy Noodliness looking over him!&lt;br&gt;

Recently, though, we’ve really started growing in number and in enthusiasm, as fellow Skeptics-in-the-Pub attendees began stepping up and asking to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our A/V mavens, Maggie and Sarah, will be beefing up BostonSkeptics.com with a more professional redesign and better organization pointing to speaker lists and videos. We’ll also be working on more events, more audio and video content, and more content on the blog. To that end, you’ll notice a few Skepchick commenters now posting over there with content focused on local science and skeptical activism, which I think will be interesting to those of you in the New England area as well as around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, we’ve had posts from Jared (known here as Expatria), Liz (aka kitty), and Josh (aka furtim). Josh, bless him, has already managed to piss off a Libertarian with his post: &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=186"&gt;Abortion, Skepticism, and the Importance of Standing Firm&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he addresses a ridiculous bid by some locals to stop the building of a new Planned Parenthood on the grounds that the center will attract anti-choice protesters with their bloody fetus signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His post is excellent, as are Jared’s and Liz’s. Check them out, and if you’re interested, sign up to the RSS feed as there will be a lot more coming in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250180081539"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/08/watching-lullabot-learning-vi/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a0973ebce00864bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">watching @lullabot Learning Vi…</title><published>2009-08-13T15:38:21Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T15:38:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/08/watching-lullabot-learning-vi/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;watching @lullabot Learning Views video and actually learning a bit !drupal&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250179773799"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6209250122644166111">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9276e0852f5753f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Nobel Prize" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Nobel Laureates: Peter Doherty and Rolf Zinkernagel</title><published>2009-08-13T14:57:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T15:43:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/08/nobel-laureates-peter-doherty-and-rolf.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6209250122644166111/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6209250122644166111" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1966&amp;quot;for their discoveries concerning the specificity of the cell mediated immune defence&amp;quot;Peter C.

One interesting conundrum this raises is that it makes me question whether &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; understand the ideas behind natural selection as well as I think I do, but that's a topic for another post. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other thing the post reminded me of was that I've been planning to write a blog post about the unfortunate double meaning of the word "faith."  In the comments on that post, the phrase "faith in science" was used, and while I agree with what the commenters and the blog author were getting at, I am not comfortable with that word being used.  I think there are two meanings of the word faith, and I think this is confusing for theists and results in that whole "Well, I have faith in Christ, you have faith in science.  No difference!" fallacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both meanings of the word faith involve believing something with insufficient evidence, or at least, without enough evidence to justify the level of confidence.  So there is a similarity there.  The two major differences, in my mind, are in 1) the presence of a pragmatic justification in one case for believing with insufficient evidence, and 2) the amount of contradictory evidence required to change the belief.  I think these differences are distinct enough to make the two meanings of faith entirely different concepts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the post at Gene Expression describes, having "faith in science" is usually a matter of recognizing that reality is often counterintuitive, that as a result the scientific method is a better way of discerning truth than common sense, and lastly that it takes specialized knowledge to really understand the truth in a particular field.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The logical conclusion of this is that one's own intuition in a field where one does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; have specialized knowledge is probably not going to be particularly accurate.  The alternatives are to try to become educated in every possible area (which is not practical for those of us who have jobs and/or social lives), or to put tentative implicit trust in what the "experts" say about fields in which we are not knowledgable.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, figuring out who is an "expert" worth listening to is easier said than done, and hence this is why I say that this is believing on insufficient evidence.  I can't check out the claims of every expert I chose to trust.  I can educate myself and see if their claims even make sense, but in many cases I'm ultimately going to have to chose between people who strongly disagree and yet whom I have no way of knowing who is right.  We just do the best we can in these cases, because pragmatism dictates it must be so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other thing that makes so-called "faith in science" different from religious faith is the standard of &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;proof.  This is not to say that those of us who chose to put stock in the consensus of "experts" are always perfect at reacting to solid evidence that our previous beliefs were false.  It's always hard to change one's beliefs; that's human nature.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In some ways, this is even a good thing: As previously mentioned, reality is often counter-intuitive, so if I am presented with evidence that seems to me to contradict the established scientific paradigm, I would be well-advised to be resistant to accepting that evidence until I gather more information, no matter how plain the evidence may seem to me.  This is because there may be some grievous error in the argument that I am not aware of due to my ignorance in a particular field. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result of this is an undue preference for the current scientific orthodoxy.  This has been historically demonstrated, with a recent example being the powerful resistance to plate tectonics theory.  However, I don't see any reasonable way of avoiding this momentum for the status quo.  The other alternatives are to either become 100% educated about everything (impossible), or to shift undue stock in our own personal intuition about things which we know nothing about -- and most educated people understand that doesn't usually work out so well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while pragmatism may lead us to exhibit an undue preference for scientific orthodoxy, this is &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; compared to the immutability of religious faith.  This is complete apples and oranges.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one thing, religious faith is mostly atomic, or at least highly interconnected.  If one part is proven to be abjectly false, then sometimes it becomes difficult to continue to justify belief in the rest, e.g. if the story of Moses is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses#Historicity"&gt;shown to be pure fable&lt;/a&gt;, then the rest of Judaism kind of falls by the wayside.  In contrast, the body of scientific knowledge is constantly changing, with old ideas shown to be mistaken, misunderstood, or even abjectly false, yet this does not in any way impact the validity of the scientific method -- or even in the idea of "faith in science" in the sense I am referring to it in this post.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For another, religious faith seems uniquely capable of spreading unwavering crankery more effectively than any other ideas.  Certainly, you will get the rare cantankerous old scientist who does all sorts of mental contortions to stick to an old idea from the scientific orthodoxy which has since been proven false -- perhaps even contortions on the order of what Young Earth Creationists are known to do.  But this is rare.  YECs make up a non-trivial percentage of the American population.  Not sure one can say the same about Flat-Earthers... and yet both ideas are equally ridiculous and require similarly fantastic mental contortions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognizing these differences, I think it would be preferable to use a different word for the "faith in science" idea.  I'm not sure what that word would be... but it should be a word that captures the idea that, yes, although I believe this with insufficient evidence, I am ready to change my mind or adopt a more nuanced position if presented with sufficient evidence to justify the change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This post is already too long and I need to get to work.  I may revise it or expand on it later..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-4435605491755262378?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250179147928"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14926">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/500498df9c868c35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Atheist Party in Chicago!</title><published>2009-08-13T15:00:20Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T15:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/13/atheist-party-in-chicago/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Update***&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=146277950389"&gt;Facebook event&lt;/a&gt; for this party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Chicagoans: Save the date of Saturday, September 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be having an atheist party (with British guests) at &lt;a href="http://www.matissetavernchicago.com/live/"&gt;Matisse&lt;/a&gt; that evening!  It begins at 7:30 p.m.  More information to come.&lt;/p&gt;

There, besides quackery, I got my first taste of the lies of the anti-vaccine movement from the likes of denizens of the newsgroup like &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/misc.health.alternative/browse_thread/thread/3a5bc91cb36a639d/65f4b02650ea5435?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=jan+drew#65f4b02650ea5435"&gt;Jan Drew&lt;/a&gt; and Ilena Rosenthal, who's best known for her &lt;a href="http://www.humanticsfoundation.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;silicone breast implant conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; but by the principles of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/crank_magnetism_1.php"&gt;crank magnetism&lt;/a&gt; is also an &lt;a href="http://ilenarose.blogspot.com/2009/05/big-thank-you-to-lucky-for-these.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;anti-vaccinationist&lt;/a&gt;, to name a couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not mentioning this to show what an old fart I am, blogospherically speaking, but rather to say that I've been around a while. I thought I had knew about pretty much every major anti-vaccine website and blog out there, and my connections usually let me know about new ones very rapidly. So it was to my surprise to see that there's a slick new anti-vaccine website in town, and that it's been around at least a month now. Worse, it's a website that's using the authority of physicians to try to persuade the public that it's not a load of pseudoscience. Echoing the infamous website of the granddaddy of modern anti-vaccine groups, the &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt; (which I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dr_bob_sears_stealth_anti-vaccinationist.php"&gt;blogged about before&lt;/a&gt;, natch!), this website is known as the &lt;a href="http://www.mvvic.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Medical Voices Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing I can say about it, it's run, don't walk, away from these doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dont_listen_to_these_medical_voices_or_h.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dont_listen_to_these_medical_voices_or_h.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/bNQ4GFx-sjI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250178164587"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=16529">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/caddbebe82f9faac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="gold"/><category term="lying"/><category term="television"/><title type="html">How to Call Someone's Bluff and Keep Your Gold</title><published>2009-08-13T14:52:14Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T14:52:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/how-to-call-someones-bluff-and-keep-your-gold/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I'm watching Deadwood, the remarkably well-written HBO series of a few years ago.

One type of question being investigated is the degree to which brain organization is pre-programmed in the genes vs a result of the process of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that both processes are involved. Human brains are all grossly the same – I have looked at hundreds of MRI scans of patients and they are all pretty much laid out the same way. Neurologists get very good at predicting exactly where a lesion will be in the brain based upon a patient’s symptoms and exam. This ability to localize a lesion is based upon the assumption that all brains are organized the same, and this assumption turns out to be almost always correct, at least to a level of precision required for a clinical assessment. (There are known variations in terms of which side of the brain will house certain specific functions – for example most people are dominant for language in the left hemisphere, but some left-handed people have language in the right hemisphere.) This suggests that genetics plays a dominant role in determining the large-scale structure of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neuroscience researchers often operate at a much finer level of detail in terms of neuroanatomy, often dealing with the micro-structure of the brain. And the question remains, at fine levels of detail, how much of the brain’s structure is pre-determined by genetics, how much results from the process of development, and how much is plastic (determined by later use)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that mapping plays an important role in brain development. This is a process by which neurons will map to sensory input or other feedback. When babies see, for example, their visual cortex will map to the stream of information coming in from the retina. The visual cortex therefore creates a literal map of the retina. Genes do not need to lay out this map, like a blue-print, but only have to set up the rules and then allow the mapping to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroanatomy of Vision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the organization of vision in the brain is much more complex than a simple map of the retina. Visual information undergoes a great deal of processing to make the information more useful. Edges and contrast are enhanced, for example. Also information is processed in such a way as to create three-dimensionality and depth. Generally speaking, optical illusions are tricks that expose these kinds of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more than optical processing, what we see also conveys meaning (arguably the ultimate evolutionary utlity of vision). The most obvious is probably pattern recognition: we don’t just see shapes, color, and depth – we see things. The famous eponymous essay in the book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks desribes a man who had a stroke in the occipital-temporal region on boths sides. As a result he had &lt;a href="http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200503/000020050304A0905040.php"&gt;visual agnosia&lt;/a&gt; – he could see but could not put all the pieces together and recognize specific things. So he could see the shape of his wife’s head, which is similar to the shape of his hat, but could not tell the two apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also specific forms of visual agnosia, or type-specific. Prosopagnosia (lesion of the right fusiform gyrus), for example, results in the inability to recognize faces. Landmark agnosia (right parahippocampal gyrus) results in the inability to identify specific buildings or landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="ventral stream" src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ventral-stream.jpg" alt="ventral stream" width="277" height="207"&gt;To back up a bit further – our current models of visual organization in the brain is that there are &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6WBY-4SYCGCG-3&amp;amp;_user=483692&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_searchStrId=979622073&amp;amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;amp;_acct=C000022720&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=483692&amp;amp;md5=d1aab8330ed0aedbd3607d33bb36653f"&gt;two streams of visual information&lt;/a&gt;: the ventral stream relates to object recognition (and lesions of which result in visual agnosia, as described above), and the dorsal stream is for planning actions. Lesions of the dorsal stream result in what is called optic ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal stream of visual information is therefore related to seeing an object heading in your direction and getting out of the way, or to the act of catching a baseball. While the ventral stream will tell you that what you are catching is a baseball and not a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add a further layer of complexity, the ventral stream is divided into various regions with different specialties. The medial structures in the ventral stream relate to non-living objects, while more lateral structures specifically relate to living objects. There are also identifiable specialized regions, such as for &lt;a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.2.4988"&gt;visual word recognition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhp111"&gt;texture vs form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But clearly, living vs non-living is an important distinction to make, and it is interesting that the visual pathways would separate out based upon such an abstract concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Back to Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all leads back to the original topic of this post, which is to discuss some new research relating to the development of separate visual pathways in the ventral stream for living vs non-living objects. The question at hand is whether or not this level of brain organization within the ventral stream is determined by genetics or by development and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question Dr. Mahon and colleagues at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC) at the University of Trento, Italy, and Harvard University looked at the brain of subjects with normal vision and subjects who have been blind since birth. The assumption is that those who have been blind since birth have never had any sensory input to their visual cortex, and therefore no developmental mapping or plasticity with use has taken place. Therefore, whatever organization they find is likely innate and determined by genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the&lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-08/cp-ner080709.php"&gt; press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the same regions of the ventral stream that show category preferences for nonliving stimuli and animals in sighted adults, show the same category preferences in adults who are blind since birth,” explains senior study author Dr. Alfonso Caramazza from the CIMeC and Harvard University. “Our findings suggest that the organization of the ventral stream innately anticipates the different types of computations that must be carried out over objects from different conceptual domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. So our brains evolved to inherently distinguish between living and non-living things – this ability is built into the basic structure of our visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a book I recently read called &lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/about-supersense/"&gt;Supersense by Bruce Hood&lt;/a&gt;, in which he argues that we have an innate sense that there is something fundamentally different between things that are alive and things that are not alive. This results, he argues, in supernatural beliefs in a life force or life essence to explain our strong innate feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that this latest research supports Hood’s premise – the distinction between living and inanimate seems to be fundamental to human brain organization. And if the evolutionary pressures were strong enough to result in these categories of objects being distinct in our vision, it is likely that the same is true about how we emotionally and intellectually categorize the world too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact Hood goes over many psychological experiments that show just that – even infants think very differently about living and non-living things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating area of neuroscience research, which is really taking off due to fMRI and other techniques. It is interesting, but not surprising, that at this fundamental level of  brain anatomy development appears to be following a genetic blue-print, rather than just reacting to input or use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250176164830"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-137205475302088411">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12f75a985f12d5ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Atheist Radio at the University of Toronto</title><published>2009-08-13T14:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T14:53:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/08/atheist-radio-at-university-of-toronto.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/137205475302088411/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=137205475302088411" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The University of Toronto publishes eBulletin once or twice a week to let people know what&amp;#39;s going on.

According to David Adams, writing in the Irish Times,  &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0813/1224252497158.html"&gt;Attacks on the language are rising, basically&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;IT’S OFTEN the little things in life that can get to you. Take “basically”, for instance. I cannot be alone in having grown to detest the very sound of this word. It has become so annoyingly pervasive in the spoken language, you sometimes wonder if we are now incapable of relaying even the most mundane information without employing it. As in, “Basically, I was walking down the road”, or, “Basically, he was standing there”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Only good manners and not wanting to be thought a complete lunatic stop some of us from screaming: “There is no ‘basically’ about it. Either you were walking down the road or you weren’t, or he was standing there or he wasn’t.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While maintaining this tenuous hold on his sanity, Mr. Adams is also seething because in the "blogosphere" (a word he carefully places in scare quotes), "words are regularly invented, mangled or forced against their will from nouns into verbs, or vice versa".  It's a lucky thing for his peace of mind that he wasn't around in the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1241"&gt;16th century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His penultimate peeve is prosodic (and is thus, by &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002641.html"&gt;general rule&lt;/a&gt;, graced by a missing comma):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Continuing on the theme of annoyances is it only my imagination, or is the high rising terminal (HRT) habit that some of us picked up from watching too many episodes of Neighbours and Home and Away on the wane?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;HRT, as you probably know only too well, is where sentences end with an upward intonation, so that every utterance sounds like a question posed by an Australian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the origin of this pattern is apparently in a geographical cluster of English varieties that includes part of Ireland (see &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=568"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=863"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), it&amp;#39;s interesting to see Mr. Adams identifying it as an import from Australia. Perhaps this means that the Australian version really is phonetically different — though I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find any way to measure it that shows this to be true — or perhaps this is like the Pennsylvania student once interviewed on television about uptalk, who said something like &amp;quot;Well, my friends and I don&amp;#39;t talk that way? I think that&amp;#39;s something that the kids in New Jersey do? But I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll hear it around here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I certainly hope it is on the way out. I suspect, though, I’ve only stopped noticing through being distracted by another antipodean import that appears to be gaining ground. I speak of that increasingly common opening to a usually uninvited declaration by mostly self-obsessed people of what they intend doing or saying next: “Do you know what . . . ”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most puzzling of Adams' peeves. He's complaining about Ireland recently importing from Australia something that's been a standard rhetorical device since the time of Plautus. Thus Henry Baker's 1739 translation of Molière's The blunderer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Trufalin: Hark'e, dost thou know what I have just been doing?&lt;br&gt;
Mascaril: No; but certainly, if you think proper, I shan't remain long in Ignorance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language must indeed be a sad state among the Irish, if they need to send to Australia and New Zealand for this ancient device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Update — several people have suggested that I add the &lt;a href="http://www.partiallyclips.com/index.php?id=1619"&gt;latest Partially Clips&lt;/a&gt; comic to this post:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PCManAtDesk.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/PCManAtDesk.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It swaps the histrionics from one side to the other, but still…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd also observe that (as a matter of mere fact) use of &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; isn't even close to the point where "we are now incapable of relaying even the most mundane information without employing it". Specifically, according to blogpulse.com, the proportion of blog posts containing it is well under 1% (about 0.65%, more exactly):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Basically6.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note the weekly rhythm, by the way — it&amp;#39;s easy to see why this applies to &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002086.html"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt;, but this oscillation is more interesting because less obvious…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as usual, the discussion in MWDEU is a sensible one:&lt;/p&gt;

It was full of falling stars. This marked the maximum of this year's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids"&gt;Perseid meteor shower&lt;/a&gt;. Every year about this time, Earth moves through the exhaust cloud left behind by the comet Swift-Tuttle. When gravel and sand from the comet enters our atmosphere the grains burn brightly, looking like shooting stars. The meteor shower, that has been known for over 2000 years, looks like it originates in the constellation named for the Greek hero Perseus. But Swift-Tuttle itself wasn't observed until 1862!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night before bed time me and my wife lay down flat on our backs on a blanket in the yard and looked up for a while. Because of cloud cover and ground light we saw only a few bright stars and no Perseids. But tonight is going to be another good one for falling stars. Check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/Jyllands-Posten-pg3-article-in-Sept-30-2005-edition-of-KulturWeekend-entitled-Muhammeds-ansigt.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/75/Jyllands-Posten-pg3-article-in-Sept-30-2005-edition-of-KulturWeekend-entitled-Muhammeds-ansigt.png" title="Mohammad Cartoons" width="550" height="777"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fundamentalist Muslims took to violence because of the depictions, which they felt were forbidden according to the Koran.  (Though there’s more to that explanation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, their religious beliefs have no bearing on how the rest of us use our right to free speech.  We don’t have to respect or abide by their silly rules.  But due to fear, most major publications refused to publish the images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book about the controversy is set to be published later this year.  It’s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300124724?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0300124724"&gt;The Cartoons That Shook the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Jytte Klausen&lt;/strong&gt;.  It’s published by Yale University Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/books/13book.html"&gt;publishers refuse to include the images in the book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… [Klausen] was disturbed by the withdrawal of the other representations of Muhammad. All of those images are widely available, Ms. Klausen said by telephone, adding that “Muslim friends, leaders and activists thought that the incident was misunderstood, so the cartoons needed to be reprinted so we could have a discussion about it.”…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Donatich, the director of Yale University Press, said by telephone that the decision was difficult, but the recommendation to withdraw the images, including the historical ones of Muhammad, was “overwhelming and unanimous.” The cartoons are freely available on the Internet and can be accurately described in words, Mr. Donatich said, so reprinting them could be interpreted easily as gratuitous.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they’re just scared Muslims will kill them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope an academic press, of all publishers, would want to promote the idea of free speech, including speech that may offend some people.  To not include images &lt;em&gt;that are the very subject of the book&lt;/em&gt; is, as &lt;strong&gt;Reza Aslan&lt;/strong&gt; says in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article, idiotic.&lt;br&gt;

This blog post was written for a lay audience so more advanced readers will need to indulge me here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy sci-fi action movies. I love the convincing special effects and the fact that heroes can accomplish the physically impossible without skipping a beat. Implausible events unfurl with convincing reality, and you never know what might happen with the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy the TV show, &lt;em&gt;America’s Funniest Home Videos&lt;/em&gt;, for different reasons. The mundane nature of actual reality, and the often predictable, but hilarious mistakes made by those I relate to result in some pretty hearty laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a big difference between these two forms of entertainment: science-fiction requires the suspension of belief in plausibility, while home videos are based on plausible outcomes. When it comes to medical research, though, plausibility can mean the difference between science fiction and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, scientists have eagerly concocted explanations for medical phenomena. However, it wasn’t until quite recently that our knowledge of science has expanded into an amazingly concrete and fairly deep factual account of how things work. I credit the scientific method for these astonishing advances that have vastly improved our quality of life. Without rigorous testing, repeating, and retesting in a controlled manner, we wouldn’t have many of the life-saving medicines, procedures, devices, and treatment options that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, we really like science fiction. We like to believe in magical solutions and discoveries that break the mold – that there could be something out there that we find that no one else has thought of yet, or observed, or harnessed. This drive to discover is a wonderful force for investigation and scientific advancement, but it is a double edged sword. The other side can result in irrational beliefs, magical thinking, and snake oil science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example the field of homeopathy. Founded by German physician, Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century, this system of medical treatment is founded upon the principle that like treats like, and that a medicine is at its strongest when it’s at its weakest possible concentration. So, for example, if you have cold symptoms (runny eyes and nose) the treatment would be to drink onion juice (because onion fumes produce runny eyes and a runny nose), but at a concentration so dilute that there is actually not even one molecule of onion extract left. Hahnemann believed that water has memory – and that the fact that water molecules had been recently in the presence of onion molecules gave the water healing powers. In fact, the act of shaking the water made it even more potent as a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have no doubt in the sincerity of Hahnemann’s beliefs. I also have no doubt that homeopathy (for those who believe in it) can have a strong placebo effect. But to believe that there is an actual physiological effect of shaken water for the treatment of all sorts of diseases, is to deny everything that is known about human physiology, immunology, genetics, and biochemistry. Should one man’s beliefs negate the results of millions of scientific studies? The proposed mechanism of action of homeopathy is implausible, and therefore may be confidently discarded as anything more than a placebo. (And if you don’t believe me, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071225132145/http:/www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Science-Complementary-Alternative/dp/0195313682/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1198250458&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Dr. Barker Bausell&lt;/a&gt; has a wonderful review of the homeopathy literature that confirms this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, some of you plausibility skeptics say, Galileo’s beliefs (that the earth is round, not flat) were not accepted by scientists in his day (and yet he was right and they were wrong), so how can we say with certainty that any proposed mechanism of treatment is truly implausible? Isn’t anything possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose a tornado could tear through a junk yard, creating a Boeing 747 by accident, though I’m pretty sure we’ll never see that on &lt;em&gt;America’s Funniest Home Videos&lt;/em&gt; – though we may see it in a sci-fi movie. But I’m glad you asked about anything being possible – because this brings us to our final pillar of good science: reproducibility. If something is true, it should be true again and again, right? Galileo was proven right because in test after test, ships did not fall off the end of the “flat” earth. Its in the repetition of tests that we can confirm the truth. Next week we’ll take a final look at evidence through the lens of reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;

Quick! Guess the planet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5769/Saturn_Equinox_Raw_Preview_1"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/saturn_equinox_ringshadow.jpg" alt="Saturn with no rings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, if you guessed &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; then a) you’re smart, 2) you read the title of this post, c) you read the &amp;quot;alt text&amp;quot; of the image, δ) you saw that bare hint of ring in the corner of the picture, or 5) you had a one in 8 (or possibly 9) chance of getting it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; Saturn. It’s the equinox! &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5769/Saturn_Equinox_Raw_Preview_1"&gt;This image&lt;/a&gt;, taken yesterday, is a raw one from Cassini. In other words, it hasn’t been processed to clean up bad pixels and take into account other weirdnesses of the digital detector. So you can’t do quantitative science on it, but what you can do is look at it and see how the shadow of the ring on the cloudtops is a thin, thin line. That means the Sun must be shining straight along them, like a tree casting no shadow at noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is exactly what’s going on. The ring particles orbit Saturn exactly above its equator, and that means that if you were standing on Saturn’s equator (or floating, I suppose) you’d see the Sun precisely overhead at noon. That’s pretty much the definition of &amp;quot;equinox&amp;quot;. It’s true on Earth, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view_event/113/Equinox_Arrives"&gt;The images are coming in&lt;/a&gt; from Cassini fast and steady, and it’ll be a few days before they can get all processed and pretty. So for now, check out &lt;a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/"&gt;more raw images&lt;/a&gt; from the magnificent machine, and as spring settles in on Saturn’s northern hemisphere, we’ll see lots more coming from Cassini.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250167039036"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1539">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a828dee5884f3af9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="blog entry"/><title type="html">Blog Hiatus</title><published>2009-08-13T10:51:45Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T10:51:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/evZzrA21omE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1539"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">Since friends of mine have been emailed - I’m shutting down this blog and working on other projects for a while.

One of the chief tactics of the opposition is, in addition to simply lying and pretending it would be &lt;i&gt;horrible&lt;/i&gt; for poor children to get medical treatment, is to tell us horror stories about all those wicked socialist countries and their miserable health care, without the wondrous benefits of raging capitalism. &lt;a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=333933006516877"&gt;Investor's Business Daily&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, ran this &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/12/hawking_british_and_alive/"&gt;interesting example of how bad the British health services are&lt;/a&gt; (it has since been corrected, with some acute embarrassment, I hope):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The controlling of medical costs in countries such as Britain through rationing, and the health consequences thereof, are legendary," read a recent editorial from the paper. "The stories of people dying on a waiting list or being denied altogether read like a horror script...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn't have a chance in the UK, where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess they thought Stephen Hawking was an American. Maybe it was the accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, though, Stephen Hawking: British.

She's running for the office of mayor, and her #1 most important issue, the one she's made the centerpiece of her campaign, is to get &lt;a href="http://www.newson6.com/Global/story.asp?S=10888260"&gt;creationist displays installed in the Tulsa Zoo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Anna Falling, the road to city hall runs through the Tulsa Zoo.  She's made her Christianity central to her platform and now the exhibit depicting the Christian story of Creationism is her first campaign promise.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"Today we are announcing that God will be glorified in this city.  He shall not be shunned. Upon our election, we hereby commit to honoring Him in all ways that He has been dishonored,"&lt;/span&gt; said Anna Falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was news several years ago when the zoo board rejected a proposal to add sectarian Christian messages to their exhibits. The rejection must have rankled, since Falling now thinks this is the Most Important Issue for Tulsa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being ridiculous, though, it does make me marvel. The economy must be booming in Oklahoma;  the mayor doesn&amp;#39;t have to concern herself with recruiting and maintaining new businesses. There must not be any crime. Race issues have disappeared. Education…oh, never mind, creationists don&amp;#39;t worry about good education, anyway. City services must be flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you Tulsans aren't so lulled by the easy livin' in Oklahoma that you don't bother to participate in the political process any more. Get out of your easy chair on election day, strap on your jetpack or get in your flying car, zoom past the gumdrop mountain and the drinking fountains that dispense free beer, and vote!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait. The &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&amp;amp;articleid=20090812_11_A11_Republ227159"&gt;Tulsa World reports&lt;/a&gt; that she's making creationism in the zoos her top priority "among city issues that also include violent crime, budget woes and bumpy streets." How can this be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe bumpy streets aren't that big a deal when you get to work on angel's wings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/tulsa_oklahoma_must_be_paradis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/OQE1BSoM3ek" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250163930183"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=4272">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88923e4f3fcc69fa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Science"/><category term="beer"/><category term="citizen science"/><category term="wasps"/><title type="html">Insects + Beer = SCIENCE</title><published>2009-08-13T11:14:28Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T11:14:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/insects-beer-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a really fun opportunity for some participatory science this August:&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinet/45474718/"&gt;&lt;img title="wasps and wine (sorry, not beer)" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/32/45474718_1138413332_m.jpg" alt="" width="181" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I could use your help to run a North American pilot test of an inexpensive trap for yellowjackets and hornets.  If  successful it might result in development of a unique long-term survey for this group.&lt;br&gt;
I have been in correspondence with workers in the Czech Republic, Great Britain, and Northwestern North America regarding the use of traps made from plastic drink and soda bottles partially filled with beer or apple juice/cider.  These groups have been successful in trapping a variety of wasps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; We would like to see something similar tested throughout the continent,  this year we would like to get a feel for what species and situations might be most useful prior to do a larger and more statistical rigorous set of trials.  This time of year is when populations of these colonial species are at their height and thus this email to encourage you participation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So this is where you come in.  We need you to put out a trap(s) around your house, nature center, fields, and woods for 3 weeks and then send us back your “catch.”  We will put everything together and send you back a report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what you will need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beer (The Europeans have standardized on Heineken but for this trial just use whatever is on hand)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple cider or juice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want try something else…go right ahead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLEAR Plastic soda or water bottle (take the labels off)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;String or wire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put a good 3 inches of beer or cider in the bottom of the bottle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep the top of the bottle off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hang the bottle (from a tree or post) about 3-4 feet off the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; ground….hang the bottle by the neck.&lt;br&gt;
Locations could be in any habitat with an emphasis on woodlands (which&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; are likely have the highest species richness).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the end of 3 weeks strain out your sample and mail it in via the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; following procedure (note the alcohol and vinegar both will preserve the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; specimens over the 3 weeks).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mailing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rinse specimens under cool water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put into ziplock bag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add a very SMALL amount of alcohol, just enough to DAMPEN them (isopropyl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; is fine).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add a paper towel to keep any excess alcohol in place&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put that bag into ANOTHER zip lock bag with another paper towel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put those bags into ANOTHER plastic bag and tie tightly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ship in a padded envelope or box to me along with the who, what, where&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; below:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data needed for each trap:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your name&lt;br&gt;
Your location (gps, mailing address, description, map)&lt;br&gt;

Habitat&lt;br&gt;
Notes&lt;br&gt;
Email address so we can contact you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s it, your ticket to fame is guaranteed, many thanks for the help and participation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A recent New York Times article described the Japanese profession of hostessing, which involves entertaining men at establishments where customers pay a lot to flirt and drink with young women (&lt;strong&gt;services that do not, as a rule, involve prostitution&lt;/strong&gt;)."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;So, does this quote mean that there exists a rule that says it cannot involve prostitution? Or is it rather stating that there is no rule that it must involve prostitution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; Is it forbidden, or just not required?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded, somewhat unsympathetically, with the opinion that "as a rule" is just a  quantifier over instances, meaning something like "in general" or "in most cases", and not evoking any concept of a rule in the deontic sense at all. This invalidated Rob's curiosity about "whether there was the absence of some rule mandating it, or the presence of a rule forbidding it".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob was a bit disappointed, I think, so I decided to try to do better, first by confirming my impression of how the expression "as a rule" is now used, and second by tracing its history to see if his interpretation has a basis in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contemporary examples, no mandating or forbidding is (as a rule) anywhere in sight. From the current harvest at Google News:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;As a rule, observational studies like this are less reliable than placebo controlled trials.&lt;br&gt;
As a rule, journalists are always in search of the dramatic and the new.&lt;br&gt;
In this country, as a rule, boxers come from the bottom: Black, brown, immigrants, the poor, the uneducated.&lt;br&gt;
You take it any way you can get it, but generally, as a rule, the easiest way is to win the division.&lt;br&gt;
Teams, as a rule, prefer the opposition to rebound out of defence along the boundary line.&lt;br&gt;
But as a rule, watching a three-game set between these teams is a more serious time commitment than watching the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These quotations don't imply any sort of regulation or mandate. They're all just ways of talking about how things generally are, not how they should be or must be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it seems that the foundation for this non-regulatory interpretation goes back to middle English. The OED's entry for &lt;strong&gt;rule&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;n.&lt;/em&gt; has a sub-entry for sense &lt;strong&gt;11.a.&lt;/strong&gt; glossed as "A fact (or the statement of one) which holds generally good; that which is normally the case".  The citations for this sense go back to 1300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense is extended in &lt;strong&gt;11.b.&lt;/strong&gt; to the expression&lt;strong&gt; as a&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;rule&lt;/strong&gt;, glossed as &amp;quot;normally, generally&amp;quot;. However, the citations for this expression only date from 1842 — and without context, it&amp;#39;s hard to be confident that the first two of them don&amp;#39;t carry at least a tinge of the &amp;quot;regulation&amp;quot; sort of meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1842&lt;/strong&gt; CHRISTIE in &lt;em&gt;Fleury's Eccl. Hist.&lt;/em&gt; I. 137 note, The Oblation was, as the rule, made in the morning. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1845&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Encycl. Metrop.&lt;/em&gt; II. 818/2 Where two decisions [are] of equal value,..as a rule, the second usually prevails. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1878&lt;/strong&gt; HUXLEY &lt;em&gt;Physiography&lt;/em&gt; 5 As a rule, hail falls in summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I turned to Literature Online to see whether the regulatory nature of "as a rule" might have changed over time. And I found that it seems to have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 1800 or so, the examples are almost all  part of expressions like "laid down as a rule", "established as a rule", etc., which have a distinctly regulatory flavor. A typical (if ironic) example can be found in the opening passage of Henry Fielding's 1749 novel Tom Jones ("Of the SERIOUS in writing; and for what Purpose it is introduced"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Peradventure there may be no Parts in this prodigious Work which will give the Reader less Pleasure in the perusing, than those which have given the Author the greatest Pains in composing. Among these probably may be reckoned those initial Essays which we have prefixed to the historical Matter contained in every Book; and which we have determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of Writing, of which we have set ourselves at the Head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For this our Determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to assign any Reason; it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it down &lt;strong&gt;as a Rule&lt;/strong&gt; necessary to be observed in all Prosai-comi-epic Writing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in a more sober vein, Sir Joshua Reynolds' 1778 address to the Royal Academy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It would be useful to a Painter to enquire into the true meaning and cause of rules, and how they operate on those faculties to which they are addressed; by knowing their general purpose and meaning, he will often find that he need not confine himself to the literal sense, it will be sufficient if he preserves the spirit of the Law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It is given &lt;strong&gt;as a rule&lt;/strong&gt;, for instance, by Fresnoy, That the principal Figure of a Subject must appear in the midst of the Picture, under the principal light, to distinguish it from the rest . A Painter who should think himself obliged strictly to follow this rule, would incumber himself with needless difficulties; he would be confined to great uniformity of composition, and be deprived of many beauties which are incompatible with its observance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, post-1900 examples are almost all of the type we saw in the current newspaper articles. This passage from W.H. Auden's (parodic) 1931 &lt;em&gt;Address for a Prize-Day&lt;/em&gt; is a bit long, but it shows the pattern, and I enjoyed reading it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;All of you must have found out what a great help it is, before starting on a job of work, to have some sort of scheme or plan in your mind beforehand. Some of the senior boys, I expect, will have heard of the great Italian poet Dante, who wrote that very difficult but wonderful poem, The Divine Comedy . In the second book of this poem, which describes Dante's visit to Purgatory, the sinners are divided into three main groups, those who have been guilty in their life of excessive love towards themselves or their neighbours, those guilty of defective love towards God and those guilty of perverted love. Now this afternoon I want, if I may, to take these three divisions of his and apply them to ourselves. In this way, I hope, you will be able to understand better what I am driving at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To start with, then, the excessive lovers of self. What are they like? These are they who even in childhood played in their corner, shrank when addressed. Lovers of long walks, they sometimes become bird watchers, crouching for hours among sunlit bushes like a fox, but prefer as a rule the big cities, living voluntarily in a top room, the curiosity of their landlady. Habituees of the mirror, famous readers, they fall in love with historical characters, with the unfortunate queen, or the engaging young assistant of a great detective, even with the voice, of the announcer, maybe, from some foreign broadcasting station they can never identify; unable to taste pleasure unless through the rare coincidence of naturally diverse events, or the performance of a long and intricate ritual. With odd dark eyes like windows, a lair for engines, they pass suffering more and more from cataract or deafness, leaving behind them diaries full of incomprehensible jottings, complaints less heard than the creaking of a wind pump on a moor. The easiest perhaps for you to recognise. They avoid the study fire, at games they are no earthly use. They are not popular. But isn't it up to you to help? Oughtn't you to warn them then against tampering like that with time, against those strange moments they look forward to so? Next time you see one sneaking from the field to develop photographs, won't you ask if you can come too? Why not go out together next Sunday; say, casually, in a wood: 'I suppose you realise you are fingering the levers that control eternity?'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, I'm going to get back to my chores, and recommend to Rob that he cut back on his 18th-century reading, and catch up with &lt;em&gt;as a rule&lt;/em&gt;'s last couple of centuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250159699796"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-8563135071717313945">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1eabcb77f19db347</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SoH" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="regulation" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Society of Homeopaths" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Homeopath Struck Off.

It was estimated that The Amaz!ng Meeting in Las Vegas this year was only 30% women. Here in Newport Beach, we had our best-attended OC Skeptics in the Pub last week, with a turnout of 30. There were only 5 women; that’s a 6:1 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theories abound. Is there something about critical thinking that doesn’t appeal to women? Are women more emotional and nurturing, and less analytical? Do women tend to be less interested in the sciences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it has to do with participation in science. Having visited quite a few science labs in practically every discipline, I see roughly as many women as men working. Granted we still have progress yet to make in equal representation in management roles, but that’s a separate issue.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exception, in my experience, is software and computer engineering, a field that still seems dominated by guys who are, well, like me, quite frankly. Dorks, to describe myself, and any other people in the field who voluntarily choose to accept the label. Software conferences I’ve attended have been overwhelmingly populated by men. Why the software engineering field is so heavily dominated by men has always been a complete mystery to me. But I’m not attempting to address that here; I’m simply offering it as an assumption upon which I base my hypothesis. Feel free to offer any sound criticism of that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, perhaps, a not-so-strange coincidence that so many attendees of The Amaz!ng Meeting come from software engineering. Perhaps the overlap of software guys and skepticism is largely responsible for the gender imbalance we see at TAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group with demographics hauntingly similar to skeptics is the UFO and conspiracy theory crowd. Go to a UFO conference, and you’ll see more software guys than anyone else, and the crowd as a whole will be overwhelmingly men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a hypothesis I’ve been tossing around in my own head, and I don’t pretend to assign it any undue merit; so don’t ride me out of town on a rail for sharing it. It seems to me that skepticism and UFOlogy are similar in that they can be largely practiced by Internet forum posting. In fact it seems to me that the mindsets of the two can easily blur. They’re both about searching the Internet for evidence, arguing that your evidence is better than the other guy’s, proudly calling oneself open minded and proclaiming the other guy closed minded, and doing it all from behind the safety of a computer monitor. Who sits at computer monitors all day long? Software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen this pattern too many times to dismiss it, and I’ve seen enough women working in science, that I feel confident enough to form a hypothesis. The relative scarcity of women within the skeptical movement has nothing to do with any sort of disinterest in critical thinking or science by women. Rather, it has to do with the large dilution of software guys poured into the mix, to whom the everyday practice of web-based skepticism is really appealing. Among those who make skeptical outreach and science education their career (or a large part of it), I propose that women are, in fact, equally represented. It’s just that gatherings like The Amaz!ng Meeting also attract a large gallery of software guys, and give the appearance of gender inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve re-read this several times before posting it, and there’s no doubt that a considerable number of readers are going to be offended by it. I make no pretense at diplomatic skills, I just think it’s an important topic and well deserving of open discussion. I therefore offer myself as the fall guy to absorb any and all charges of bias against men, women, software guys, UFO guys, software women, UFO women, errant sasquatches, guys like me, or anyone else who feels insulted. I certainly don’t have all the answers, maybe some of you can help get us there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250156658399"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2751">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b14b140b580485f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autistic Youth Coming of Age</title><published>2009-08-13T09:00:04Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T09:00:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/sK-uk9yH2bA/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250156400639"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4929d09d4882d3d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gravity"/><title type="html">What Makes the Universe Expand?</title><published>2009-08-13T07:05:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T07:05:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the Universe started with a bang.  Everything was hot, dense, and expanding.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand/bigbang.jpg" width="500" title="I wish they would stop extrapolating back *before* inflation." alt="bigbang.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 13.7 billion years later now, and our Universe is cold and sparse.  The temperature of the leftover glow from the big bang -- which used to be over 10^30 degrees -- is now down to 2.7 Kelvin, just barely above absolute zero.  The Universe used to be denser than the center of the Sun.  Now, on average, the density of the Universe is only about one &lt;i&gt;proton&lt;/i&gt; per cubic meter, with mass clumped into stars and galaxies separated by trillions of miles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand/fbgalax_hst.jpg" width="500" title="Yup, another shot from Hubble." alt="fbgalax_hst.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for all of it, the Universe is &lt;i&gt;still expanding&lt;/i&gt;.  What's amazing is, despite all of the things that could cause this expansion, there's only &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; thing that the expansion rate depends on.  Know what it is?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density"&gt;energy density&lt;/a&gt; of the Universe.  Or, in other words, the total amount of matter, radiation, neutrinos, and all other forms of energy &lt;i&gt;in the entire Universe&lt;/i&gt; divided by the Universe's volume.  I'll say it again: energy density is the only thing that determines the rate of expansion of the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is remarkable, and here's why.  First off, the Universe could have existed in one of &lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt; ways.  It could have been curved like a sphere (what we call &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt;), curved like a saddle (what we call &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt;), or completely flat (what we call &lt;i&gt;zero curvature&lt;/i&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand/geometry_illustration.jpg" width="500" title="The three types of spatial curvature." alt="geometry_illustration.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Universe were either positively or negatively curved, the three angles of triangles in space would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; add up to 180 degrees!  And the expansion rate would be dramatically changed by the presence of curvature.  The fact that we have &lt;b&gt;none&lt;/b&gt; is still a mystery for us, although &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be.php"&gt;perhaps inflation explains why&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the expansion rate depends on energy density means something else: at different &lt;i&gt;times&lt;/i&gt; in the Universe, different things were important.  Think about this: if you have a Universe where you double the volume, the matter density halves.  Right?  Same mass, twice the volume, therefore the density is half.  I mean, look, the coins on the bigger ballon are clearly less dense, right?  Same number of coins, but they're spread out over a larger volume:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand/FG26_005.JPG" width="500" title="This is also a good analogy for the Hubble expansion of the Universe." alt="FG26_005.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But radiation -- things like light -- not only dilute like matter does, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/redshift_and_distance_in_the_e.php"&gt;it gets redshifted&lt;/a&gt;, which means its energy density drops &lt;b&gt;faster&lt;/b&gt; than matter does.  So when the Universe was very young and very hot and very dense, radiation was &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; important than matter was!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Universe cooled, matter became more important, and dominated the expansion rate for billions of years.  But there's something else in the Universe, something that &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; dilute as space expands.  It appears that there's an energy inherent in space itself, and this is what we call &lt;b&gt;dark energy&lt;/b&gt;.  Some people call it a cosmological constant.  Why constant?  Because its energy density &lt;i&gt;never drops&lt;/i&gt;.  Just a few billion years ago, dark energy became the dominant form of energy in the Universe.  Matter gets less dense, but dark energy never does.  If we graphed them all together -- radiation, matter, and dark energy -- you'd see which one dominated the expansion rate of the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/what_makes_the_universe_expand/dens.png" width="512" title="Radiation dominates when the Universe is very young, matter dominates for a long time, and dark energy dominates today, and for all of the foreseeable future." alt="dens.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it.  That's all that causes the Universe's expansion: the total amount of energy that's in it.  From here to infinity, as far as we can tell, dark energy will &lt;i&gt;continue&lt;/i&gt; to dominate the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of you are inclined towards math, and will want an equation that relates the Hubble expansion rate (H) to the energy density (ρ).  Well, I hate getting too technical, so here you go:

And nothing else, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2009/tulsa_elections/images/candidate-Falling.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2009/tulsa_elections/images/candidate-Falling.jpg" title="AnnaFalling" width="300" height="350"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least of her problems is that she wants the Tulsa Zoo to &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&amp;amp;articleid=20090812_11_A11_Republ227159"&gt;include an exhibit on Creationism&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, look who she wants running the city:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“We will also look for people who want to characterize the origins of both man and animals in a way that honors Judeo-Christian science that proves God as the creator,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked whether she meant that she would recruit Christians to serve the city, Falling said she was talking about “people committed to their churches.” When asked whether she meant Christian churches, she said, “churches, yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling’s campaign has been overtly Christian-themed. But she said she wants to embrace people of all religions, not alienate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d love to be able to visit with them,” she said, adding that there’s common ground. “I know God loves them. I love them. This is an opportunity for us to be able to be friends and make a difference in this community.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she deserves ridicule for suggesting that the zoo should endorse Creationism, that there is such a thing as “Judeo-Christian science,” and that such a science has ever “proven” anything, I’m more concerned with the potential lawsuits she has coming her way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on her comments, atheists would be openly discriminated against.  She’s opening the door to all sorts of litigation.  If she were mayor, the taxpayers of Tulsa would be on the hook for paying for all sorts of lawyer fees with every lost case — and she would lose them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget a wall of separation between church and state.  Falling wants to tear down the wall and have the two move in together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about how the police and fire departments are way over-budget, &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2009/tulsa_elections/Falling.html"&gt;she explains how she would solve the problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Tulsa’s churches, if invited into City Hall in force, could transform our City’s brokenness by helping mentor before real problems arise. This in turn reduces police, courts and juvenile costs, and sees lives transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our police officers deserve this kind of support!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will she fix the mass-transit problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Right now, bus riders know the route will not always take them to the intended destination. Limitations to stops and routes make most everyone have to walk at least some distance. In other areas, whole parts of town are simply missing from the bus routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as most have found, buses do not run to church on Sunday. How do churches address the Sunday issue? They pick up their parishioners in the church vans or buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can’t we activate the churches to be part of the solution? They can help provide companies in non-bus route areas with a new transportation solution for their workers, and provide a whole new world of job choices to workers who are currently limited on job choices due to the limited bus routes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s her top priority if elected?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1. Bringing Tulsa’s churches into City Hall to receive training and equipping; then activating them in Tulsa’s schools, neighborhoods, jails and low-income housing areas to restore wholeness to the community and lower city costs associated with each.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice intentions, but completely illegal.  You would think a potential government official would read up on the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see anything that says she has a chance of winning… but it’s Oklahoma.  So who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to everyone for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today the initial results came in and according to Wiseman, over 26,000 peopleparticipated (I was one of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one part of the project we asked people to carry out one of four happiness boosting exercises and compared the subsequent levels of reported happiness with those using a control technique (simply thinking about the day before). The result show that spending just a few moments thinking about one thing that went well yesterday is a surprisingly effectively way of boosting happiness. Compared to those in the control group, this procedure resulted in a 15% boost in reported happiness. Lots more details &lt;a href="http://www.scienceofhappiness.co.uk/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She reads your palm. She reads tarot cards. She interpret your dreams. She talks to the dead. She performs spells, counter spells, and love spells. She improves your sex life. She runs off with your money. She gives you fortune-cookie-quality advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. What was that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gives you fortune-cookie-quality advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She improves your sex life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OHHH! She runs off with your money. &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/08/psychic-on-lam.html"&gt;Yeah, about that&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some people who went to Senora Monica for tarot readings were also dupes into giving her their money so that she might “cleanse” it in exchange for a small fee. What they didn’t realize that the small fee was actually all of their money. And she didn’t so much “cleanse” it as “run off with it”. Now police are on the hunt for her. If you have any information about Senora Monica’s whereabouts, please call Lakewood police at 253-830-5000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, if you can’t trust a self-proclaimed psychic, who can you trust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several large-scale studies [1-3] have been released showing that acupuncture and various forms of placebo acupuncture have clinically insignificant differences in the reduction of pain, proponents of acupuncture are now looking at brain-imaging to explore the mechanisms of acupuncture and placebo acupuncture to determine if acupuncture and placebo acupuncture operate via different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study [4], researchers hypothesized that long term acupuncture therapy may result in increased opioid receptor availability and that these effects would not be observed in a placebo acupuncture group. Their subjects consisted of 20 women randomly divided into 2 groups of 10 subjects. One group received traditional acupuncture treatment while another group received non-invasive, placebo acupuncture. Results from PET scans using contrast material were taken during a 90-minute period, during which acupuncture treatment or sham acupuncture treatment was administered during the 45-90 minute timeframe. A period followed in which subjects received 7 acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatments, and then the PET scan procedure was repeated, for a total of 9 treatments. Results indicate acupuncture therapy evoked short-term increases in MOR binding potential, in multiple pain and sensory processing regions including the cingulate (dorsal and subgenual), insula, caudate, thalamus, and amygdala. Acupuncture therapy also evoked long-term increases in MOR binding potential in some of the same structures including the cingulate (dorsal and perigenual), caudate, and amygdala. These short- and long-term effects were absent in the sham group where small reductions were observed, an effect more consistent with previous placebo PET studies.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Christina Stephens)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250139496161"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1601308332556312057">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f9a144168aec32e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">New Book: The Christian Delusion: Why Faith Fails</title><published>2009-08-15T03:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-15T03:49:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/JMvknNR6Xf0/new-book-christian-delusion-why-faith.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-book-christian-delusion-why-faith.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/site/thechristiandelusion/"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; was created by Richard Carrier for our new book.

&lt;p&gt;Well, now they’ve got some explaining to do because it turns out that &lt;a href="http://pastoraaron.info/2009/08/11/scarlet-a-for-a-day/"&gt;one Christian couple decided to perform a little social experiment&lt;/a&gt; and tagged along with the SSA to the “museum” to find out for themselves first-hand what it’s like to wear a scarlet ‘A’ for a day. They didn’t literally wear any atheist OUT Campaign merchandise displaying the scarlet ‘A’ but they were given name tags that identified them as being with the SSA, so as far as everyone was aware, they were one us. And while spending a day in the atheist’s shoes, what they found appalled them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… While I did not have a T-shirt (a symbol anyway) it was obvious that there was a distinctive way that we were being treated because of the shared identification. There were hateful glances, exaggerated perceptions, waxing surveillance by security, and anxious but strong ‘amens’ accompanying a lecture on “The Ultimate Proof of Creation” by Dr. Jason Lisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how Christians treat people? Is this how we follow Jesus’ commandment to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us? I cannot help but think that many Christians are fearful of atheists. It is a sort of xenophobia that runs along lines of faith and belief. What we tend to forget is that atheists, agnostics, and evolutionists are people too. If our attempt to preserve our belief means that we are treating these people like animals, are we really holding up principles that are based on a creation worldview?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have rarely been times in my life that I have been ashamed of people that I call “brothers and sisters in Christ.” This was one of them…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even their fellow Christians find their behavior repulsive! I think that says a lot. I would like to thank the Christian couple for taking the time to see what it’s like being in our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of rabbis and Jewish mystics have decided to take advantage of 21st century science while combining it with Iron Age superstition by boarding an airplane and flying over Israel while chanting magic spells and blowing their shofars (the musical instrument, you perv) in order to stop the H1N1 flu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight’s aim was “to stop the pandemic so people will stop dying from it,” Rabbi Yitzhak Batzri was quoted as saying in Yedioth Aharanot newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu is often referred to as H1N1 in Israel, where pigs are seen as unclean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Just wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silly rabbis. Trix are for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday we arrived on Appledore Island and settled in among the squawking herring gulls, which grudgingly walk out of our way as we walk by, as if to say, it’s our island. Tuesday morning we marched out to the northern edge of the island to learn about the intertidal zone, the place where the ocean meets land in necklace of pools and rocks battered by waves and coated in slimy algae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/08/tidepool440.jpg" alt="tidepool440.jpg" align="left"&gt;A wicked lightning storm promptly drove us back to safety, and we spent the morning learning the intricacies of parasites that reign supreme in the intertidal zone, infesting snails, crabs, fish, and those squawking gulls. In the evening we were able to return to the intertidal zone in peace, to inspect cages where hapless crabs must wait to be infected by their parasite overlords. We were disturbed only by mosquitoes, which seem to be able to hammer nails into the skin. It turns out that these parasites (flatworms called trematodes) don’t just affect their host species, but can even influence how much algae grows there, because infected snails eat less than healthy ones. And the sheer mass of the parasites is astounding, with most of the snails in the higher parts of the zone merely puppets for trematodes. Knowing that, I feel even more at home here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/08/hagfish440.jpg" alt="hagfish440.jpg" align="left"&gt;Tuesday we pursued the White Whale of vertebrate evolution, the hagfish. It’s a hit-or-miss affair, and in our case it was a miss. We traveled for an hour from Appledore Island to reach a Shoals hagfish trap, hoping to bring up some live ones. En route we saw astonishing gatherings of tuna leaping out of the water, along with fin whales lifting their stately backs. When we reached the trap buoy, the students learned how to haul a tub 400 feet up from the bottom of the sea. (Note the rope in hand and the reporter’s notebook stashed in the back: true hands-on journalism.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, only mud and bait fish were inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the lab, the director of Shoals, Willy Bemis, cut open some hagfish he caught earlier this year to show why it’s worth going so far for a fish. Hagfish are not-quite-vertebrates. They have a brain and a braincase like us, along with a few other vertebrate-like traits, but they fall profoundly short. They have no skeleton but just a rope of cartilage they can tie into knots. And they have evolved weird traits of their own, like a sideways set of jaws and the ability to spew slime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/08/officehours440.jpg" alt="officehours440.jpg" align="left"&gt;The students are now pounding out stories late into the night, and there’s more in store: the history of New England recorded in shells and bones, the migration of birds from equator to Arctic, and the three-dimensional X-ray animation of bodies in motion. By Sunday, they’ll have written up their final stories, which they will be publishing &lt;a href="http://scienceonschoals.blogspot.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And then we can enjoy the view from the classroom in peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250136017329"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/12/titanic-post/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08a68e8d198f958f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="mike brown"/><category term="saturn"/><category term="titan"/><title type="html">Titanic post</title><published>2009-08-13T03:34:26Z</published><updated>2009-08-13T03:34:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/12/titanic-post/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mike Brown, who goes by the name &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/plutokiller"&gt;plutokiller on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — for good reason — has written &lt;a href="http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2009/08/long-road-to-titan-storm.html"&gt;a lengthy but interesting post about Saturn’s moon Titan&lt;/a&gt;. Why do I like it? Because it involves people, and the people are important to the story. I could write about clouds on Titan here on the BABlog, but I don’t know the people involved. Mike does, and that’s why his post is fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;

As usual before I go out of town, I’ll prep Alex with a few days of warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex,” I’ll say, “daddy and Ned are going away for a few days next week. We’re going Monday and coming back on Friday afternoon.” I don’t know what he’ll say to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="width:100px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/suitcases.jpg" alt="Image: grouptraveldiscounts.com" width="90" height="130"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: grouptraveldiscounts.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I’ve taken Ned to see my brother and his wife every August for three years now. We spend the days playing mini-golf and hitting arcades, eating good, milky fish chowder (&lt;em&gt;impossible &lt;/em&gt;to find in Manhattan!) and otherwise goofing off. I take Ned because I want Ned to build a relationship with my brother so that someday maybe I can put Ned on a plane by himself and he’ll consider it a fun week with his uncle away from the frigging parents (I want Ned to have a relationship with my sister, too, but she lives in Arizona, as yet too far away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want Alex to have a relationship with my brother and sister, too, but I’ve thought this through and just don’t see it as possible yet. For one thing, my brother has a lot of cats, which Alex would like to see move in interesting ways. For another, chasing Alex around my brother’s somewhat wide-open house would be exhausting for me and steal time from Ned’s experience with his dad and uncle. Plus, Alex gets some time alone with his mom, and moms a week with no paternal yelling. Alex also has a recreation day program that he loves all next week; the week after that, Alex goes to sleepaway camp, which is time I want with Jill and Ned, but I don’t want Alex to not see me for two solid weeks, which is why I’m going with Ned next week and not the week after. This life is a constant juggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just for now I think, Alex stays home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex, I’m going away with Ned next week. We’ll be back on Friday afternoon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence?&lt;/p&gt;

Imagine your child grows up to be an evangelical Christian or Scientologist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dale McGowan&lt;/strong&gt; explains how to handle this situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/0hCvjW3S2xI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Dale holds a view that I would hope others do, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between fundamentalist faith and an intelligent theist who accepts the world (and evolution and geology) as it is but also thinks a God could have a role in developing and guiding that world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you raise your kids to ask good questions and to be skeptical about what they learn, then you also have to accept the path they choose to follow.  It may not be the same as your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst idea, I think, is to &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; atheism onto your children and tell them they’re not even allowed to even consider a theistic worldview.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Murray"&gt;That’s going to backfire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you be really upset if your child became religious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that sadness be any different from that of your parents when you told them you were an atheist (if that was the case)?&lt;br&gt;

He is making a number of assertions about the age of the earth that are patently ridiculous: he claims 90% of all dating methods contradict the idea that the earth is millions of years old. This is simply not true. The key point in acceptance of the age of the earth is the concordance of the many methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a caller asked him to name a few, he really couldn&amp;#39;t. He mentioned the hoary old creationist assertion that the amount of salt in the ocean is inadequate to match a 4 billion year old earth — but &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CD/CD221_1.html"&gt;salt levels are in a roughly steady state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to call in to do one simple thing: to recommend the book &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/05/bones_rocks_and_stars.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bones,Rocks, and Stars&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Turney, which would correct his many lies. Unfortunately, the phone lines are locked up solid — you guys are all calling in, aren&amp;#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got through! What a waste — he simply denied the evidence that salt levels are in a roughly steady state, and then to my vast amusement, tossed in his strongest argument: &lt;b&gt;PZ Myers is an atheist&lt;/b&gt;. Can you say &lt;i&gt;ad hominem&lt;/i&gt;, boys and girls? I tried to explain to him that the dating methods used are independent of religion, that both credible &lt;i&gt;Christian&lt;/i&gt; geologists and physicists as well as Jewish, atheist, Muslim, Buddhist, whatever scientists have reached a consensus on this, but he just talked over me and claimed that those Christians have all compromised their faith. They are, apparently, not True Christians™.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, being an atheist does not discredit our opinions…but Fundamentalist Christians will so readily lie for Jesus that it does call their honesty into question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisle is playing his word games again. Note: his book is titled "The Ultimate Proof of Creation". He hasn't even offered any evidence for creationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very good question at the end: a caller asked, if the evidence is in support of creationism, why can&amp;#39;t they make an argument using just the science, leaving the Bible out of it? Lisle ducked it. He claims it&amp;#39;s a battle of worldviews, not just science — he&amp;#39;s basically conceding that he can&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/ken_ham_on_the_air_lying_again.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-eaznb7hj2I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250118914038"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25327006.post-8736532602639179376">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/97c54edf2e31c681</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="stupidity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Writer&amp;#39;s block</title><published>2009-08-12T21:52:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T22:43:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2009/08/writers-block.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/8736532602639179376/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25327006&amp;postID=8736532602639179376&amp;isPopup=true" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="html">Every day, Livejournal asks a "Writer's Block" question. It's essentially a question of the day to give people something to write on if they can't come up with anything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's question was, "Do you believe everything has a scientific explanation?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I knew better than to read the responses....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I did anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, let me add my own response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It depends on how you define "everything". Science is a methodology for explaining our universe. Thus, if it's in our universe, science can address it. It doesn't mean the answer will always be &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; on the first go, or that we'll be able to come up with one immediately, but it does mean that there is a scientific explanation out there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble comes when one starts positing things "outside" our universe. Whatever that means. In that case, science can't really have an answer, but then again, it's a rather silly assumption to make that there are such things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So as it stands, with our knowledge only being such that we know of things in our universe, the best answer is, yes, everything has a scientific explanation even if we haven't found it yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on to how other people answered:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;No. What would be the fun in that? I need mystery.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: Reality should be subject to my desires.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nature is beautiful-admire it, don't question it.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Anyone or anything that says "don't question" just scares me.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;No....That's not going to prevent us from trying, though, and as long as the government is paying we'll be there.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes. Science is just a conspiracy to make money from the government....&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;[Long poem by San Juan de la Cruz ending with the following]&lt;br&gt;And if you wish to hear:&lt;br&gt;the highest science leads&lt;br&gt;to an ecstatic feeling&lt;br&gt;of the most holy Being;&lt;br&gt;and from His mercy come His deed:&lt;br&gt;to let us stay unknowing,&lt;br&gt;rising beyond all science.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh good. A poem to willful ignorance.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;No....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does it matter that the string theory has been published? That information does not help me live my life. Frankly, I could care less.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Translation: "I'm self absorbed and if it doesn't help me directly, then it's no good."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone want to take a guess as to whether this girl was in her teens or not?&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nope. The Impossible happens everyday.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Which makes it, by definition, possible.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Not at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theres too much evidence that paranormal activity exists.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If there's "evidence", that means it can be tested, which would give mean science could address it. I think you're mistaking "personal incredulity" for evidence. Don't worry. You're not the only one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, these were the representative answers for those that answered negatively. The other one was, "Science can't explain X so no." "Love" was the #1 thing science apparently can't explain (I think Savage Garden &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJeob9BgnI4"&gt;best answers that&lt;/a&gt;). There were many "I believe in God so I can't believe in science" answers, but they were so common (and sadly expected) I didn't bother to quote them either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, there were also several good answers. I think my favorite was this:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Science has all the answers, we just do not have all the science.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8736532602639179376?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250118871453"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-7330942929946802685">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/923196404f6f1181</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Addicted to LOST’s “Teaching Moments”</title><published>2009-08-12T18:12:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-19T23:57:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/H0jBBpLhCAs/addicted-to-losts-teaching-moments.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/7330942929946802685/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/08/addicted-to-losts-teaching-moments.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/08/addicted-to-losts-teaching-moments.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__e57xAA8lsQ/SoMe0a7jKKI/AAAAAAAAAFg/3FX5uWj3J3Q/s1600-h/5451.webhotlist_lg_lost_university.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/JOuellette%20crop%2075.jpg" style="margin:0pt 5px 5px 0pt" align="left"&gt;For years, I resisted watching the TV series &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/"&gt;LOST&lt;/a&gt;. My friends loved it, assuring me that once I started watching the show, I wouldn’t be able to stop. So it seemed a good idea not to start. But then the Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange matched the producers of the DVD extras for Season 5 with a few good physicists for a filmed bonus feature. They sent some sample episodes, and we were hooked. We bought the DVDs of prior seasons and are squeezing in the odd episode whenever time permits. Who knew 40+ people stranded on a desert island could prove to be so compelling? (The millions of existing Lost fans, of course.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(0,0,238)"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/__e57xAA8lsQ/SoMe0a7jKKI/AAAAAAAAAFg/3FX5uWj3J3Q/s320/5451.webhotlist_lg_lost_university.jpg" border="0" alt="" style="float:right;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-left:10px;width:305px;height:276px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;One might be forgiven for thinking there couldn’t possibly be much science in a TV show about castaways, but one would be mistaken. There is aerodynamics in the plane crash, for instance, as well as meteorology, oceanography, and makeshift medicine as the lone doctor among the survivors tries to keep everyone healthy. And the main story arc of Season 5 relies heavily on the physics of time travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hence the request to provide theoretical physicists for a bonus feature exploring the real-world physics behind the science fiction. But the producers went one step further: the Blu-Ray edition of LOST Season 5 will feature a fictional “&lt;a href="http://www.lostuniversity.org/index.php"&gt;LOST University&lt;/a&gt;”: an interactive bonus feature wherein “students” can learn not just about general relativity and time travel, but also explore the ABCs of Egyptian hieroglyphics, gain a smattering of French and Korean (two languages featured on the series), and delve into the history of philosophy. The cast and crew will walk users through basic jungle survival skills, and actor &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001111/"&gt;Jeremy Davies&lt;/a&gt;, who plays physicist Daniel Faraday on the show, will host a special segment on his favorite topics in physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/24/lost-university"&gt;To be clear, the science of time travel on Lost does not necessarily obey all the rules&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href="http://sciencepond.com/seanmcarroll"&gt;Caltech physicist Sean Carroll&lt;/a&gt; – one of the featured instructors, along with Clifford Johnson and Nick Warner of the University of Southern California – writes at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/"&gt;Cosmic Variance&lt;/a&gt;. “But understanding how the rules are broken can serve as fodder for teaching moments just as easily as seeing them obeyed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Teaching moments” is a common refrain here at the Exchange. There is always a certain degree of tension between the creative needs of storytelling and the strict rigor associated with scientific fact. When it comes to film and television, story wins out every time – and it should. But even when a story takes liberties with the science, it still provides an opportunity to explore what is possible in the real world, versus on screen, in a novel, engaging format. We have only begun to tap into the enormous potential provided by these “teaching moments.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many ways this can be accomplished. For instance, when Watchmen was released earlier this year, physicist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Kakalios"&gt;Jim Kakalios&lt;/a&gt; – the film’s technical consultant and author of The Physics of Superheroes – released a YouTube video incorporating footage from the film into his discussion of the physics concepts that might be behind Dr. Manhattan’s superhuman powers. It’s been viewed over 1.5 million times – and still counting. Another TV series, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/"&gt;NUMB3RS&lt;/a&gt;, partnered with &lt;a href="http://www.wolfram.com/"&gt;Wolfram Research&lt;/a&gt; on a Website providing more in-depth information about the physics and mathematics featured on each episode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DVD extras provide another prime opportunity to talk about the underlying real-world science behind the fiction. We were thrilled to work with the producers of the LOST bonus features – and equally thrilled to provide scientists for the DVD extras for Season 1 of &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/"&gt;FRINGE&lt;/a&gt;. (Both will be released this fall.) LOST University takes things to the next level, exploiting the capabilities of new media like Blu-Ray and interactive online games to engage viewers beyond the weekly episodes. Talking about time travel in the context of their favorite show is a great way to make physics accessible to a broader audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea seems to be catching on. Computer science professor &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/"&gt;Luis von Ahn&lt;/a&gt; – the man who invented Captcha to weed out SPAM bots from blog comment threads – recently proposed that university professors might consider producing “Hollywood style lectures”: videotaped lectures done on a big-budget scale, with high-quality production values. “Instead of my amateurish attempts at making good lectures that fail most of the time, and instead of repeating the same thing every semester like a broken record, why don’t I just produce really good video lectures?” he ponders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It makes sense for science to be included in the mix as TV in particular begins to move online, and make use of interactive multimedia – particularly since so many nowadays have a great deal of scientific content.

His token challengers are fighting over issues like “let’s build an expensive, useless &lt;a href="http://www.stroupecondoblog.com/2008/12/nobody-wants-the-streetcar-expansion/"&gt;streetcar system&lt;/a&gt; to compete with our expensive, useless bus system,” and “maybe we should revisit our policy of &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008551284_snowcleanup23m.html"&gt;not clearing the roads&lt;/a&gt; when it snows,” and “it would be cool if we could somehow &lt;a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/local/story/822857.html"&gt;replicate Boston’s ‘Big Dig’ project&lt;/a&gt; right here in Seattle!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so in Tulsa, where mayoral candidate Anna Falling is keeping things interesting by insisting that the most important issue is &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&amp;amp;articleid=20090812_11_A11_Republ227159"&gt;adding a creationism display to the city zoo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s first,” she said to calls of “hallelujah” at a rally outside the zoo. “If we can’t come to the foundation of faith in this community, those other answers will never come. We need to first of all recognize the fact that God needs to be honored in this city.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s also got clever ideas about what sorts of people she wants in her administration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Falling, who has founded several Christian nonprofit groups and is a former city councilor, also said the next mayor needs to appoint people to boards, authorities and commissions who will “honor God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will also look for people who want to characterize the origins of both man and animals in a way that honors Judeo-Christian science that proves God as the creator,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see the potential benefits of this “honoring science” approach.  It could lead to closer ties between the &lt;a href="http://www.cityoftulsa.org/our-city/boards-and-commissions.aspx#Hispanic"&gt;Greater Tulsa Area Hispanic Affairs Commission&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=13309"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://www.cityoftulsa.org/our-city/boards-and-commissions.aspx#Ethics"&gt;Ethics Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt; could finally stake out a strong position on blasphemy.  And the &lt;a href="http://www.cityoftulsa.org/our-city/boards-and-commissions.aspx#Plumbing"&gt;Plumbing Appeals Board&lt;/a&gt; could insist that plumbers offer an add-on service of &lt;a href="http://revricky.blogspot.com/2008/09/plumber-bible-study.html"&gt;clearing out blocked places in spiritual pipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_mooneykirshenbaum_crusade.php"&gt;Mooney and Kirshenbaum’s America&lt;/a&gt;, no one taking such a pro-science stance could ever get elected.  I predict Falling won’t even make it through the primary.  And, like Mooney and Kirshenbaum, I blame the New Atheists. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250116395458"><id gr:original-id="http://thequantumlobechronicles.blogspot.com/2009/08/relationship-between-leftward-bias-and.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d999c7c00a60654f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The relationship between a leftward bias and negative emotional recognition</title><published>2009-08-12T16:53:54Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T16:53:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/Yg2tWmbUaiQ/relationship-between-leftward-bias-and.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://thequantumlobechronicles.blogspot.com/2009/08/relationship-between-leftward-bias-and.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There appears to be a growing body of evidence supporting the relationship between space and emotion.

It is a hypothetical being that is indistinguishable from you and I, or any normal human being for that matter, except for one fundamental detail. Such a zombie, for example, cries in pain (when you kick it), but it feels no pain. In other words it lacks any conscious experience. But, given their definition, this singular fact will have no bearing on the physical processes that the zombie will undergo in it's own world. Put another way, a zombie's behaviour should be indistinguishable from the behaviour and physical state of a genuine human being. This first case is the well known "zombie duplicate" -There exists a philosophical zombie that is physically indistinguishable from me , assuming of course that I can be granted consciousness. Let's stick with that for the moment. We shall come back to this point later.Now I could argue that a perfectly physical duplicate of me should live in a perfectly duplicate realm of reality. It could also be argued that the only possible world that could have a perfectly physical duplicate of me is one which is perfectly duplicated , which might be the very same possible world. Are zombies nomologically or even physically possible? To state that they are nomologically possible would be to state that in some world that shares all physical and natural laws of this world, there exists a "human being" who lacks consciousness. But wait, what happens if certain natural and physical laws do not bear any causal relation? If all natural laws are physical laws or at least dictate physical laws and if, consciousness is causally related to physical states (and there is some evidence for that), then there cannot exist any world with the same physical and natural laws as ours and yet have a zombie. It's not possible. On the other hand, if physical laws were dissociated from natural laws, then zombies could exist by breaking natural laws but not the physical ones. Remember, we have access only to physical laws (which we assume, by default to be natural laws, although this may not necessarily be true). Going further, if mental states (such as consciousness) were non physical, it seems reasonable to claim that zombies are not only nomologically possible but even logically (or physically) possible. Of course, the question still remains whether such another distinct reality, separate from ours does exist (this in itself is another huge philosophical debate). Now if this were the case, one would have a tough time proving what consciousness really is (or is not). It raises another question. How are we to assume that a zombie that exists in another physical realm sharing the same physical laws as ours but not the natural laws does not have consciousness? It may possess a different kind of consciousness that is drawn from the natural laws that govern it's world.In 1999, Robert Kirk, presented an argument which attempted to demonstrate that philosophical zombies are logically impossible. He starts by assuming that a zombie suddenly acquires non-physical qualia. A weak definition of qualia would be the property that distinguishes us from zombies (consciousness if you will). Parts of his argument are as follows:My zombie twin is unaffected by anything non-physicalSo he remains unaffected when he acquires non-physical qualiaIn order to become conscious following acquisition of this non-physical qualia, he must be affected by it in some wayBut nothing non-physical affects him. So he doesn't become conscious.To tell the difference between the subjective character of two different perceptual experiences, he must be sensitive to them or detect them in some wayIn any case, nothing non-physical affects the zombie, so he cannot distinguish non-physical qualia from having no qualiaFriends of the zombie maintain that a "conscious" being is simply the zombie component with non-physical qualia. This position entails that "conscious" humans cannot tell the difference between tea and coffe, for example.But we can tell the difference between tea and coffee.Hence, we are nothing of the sort that friends of zombies maintain we are and hence zombies in their sense are not genuinely possibleKirk's paper has been criticized but it presents an interesting case.One final word on physicalism. In short, there are no kinds of things other than physical things (including consciousness). Daniel Dennett argues that even if consciousness were purely physical, our own conviction that we are not zombies, is simply a product on the external physical world. But, we could still be zombies who think we're conscious, who think we have qualia and who think we feel pain, in ways that are we could never discover. If such were the case, it wouldn't be careless to say that "consciousness" could never be defined or understood or even proved. I for one remain hopeful that science may one day provide a good theory on how consciousness works, but Anna and I both think that even if one ends up showing how it works, one would never be able to show what it really is.  ReferencesKirk, R.

another book rehashing the same-old crap. I usually ignore it. But this time, I felt
like the promotional materials for one of the new books really stepped right into my
part of the world, rhetorically speaking, and so I figured I should give it a 
quick smackdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The book in question is Stephen C. Meyer's "Signature in the Cell". Meyer's argument
basically comes down to one that is seems like we've heard and dealt with a thousand times already. There's stuff in the cell which looks kinda-sorta like a machine if you look at it in the right way, and since machines were designed, therefore so were cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If that's all he said, I'd just ignore him. Why rehash the same old shit? But no. This time, the DI needed to add a youtube video, which makes some amazingly strong, unsupported claims.&lt;/p&gt;

The soundtrack, if you pay attention to it, repeats that claim several times in several ways: that DNA is specifically &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt; information, and that therefore the processes that operate on DNA are effectively digital computations, and since everyone knows that a digital computer required intelligent humans to design it, it's impossible that the "digital computer" in the cell evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Isis is thankful for her houseguests because this has been an impetus to take care of said boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the boxes I found a book I received a few years ago at Christmas time called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Book-of-If/dp/1400060486/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1250105097&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Big Book of If...(Questions for the Game of Life and Love)&lt;/a&gt;.  I've been reading through some of them and chuckling.  I thought it might be fun to hear some of your answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the first question I read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you had to lose feeling everywhere but one spot, where would you want the spot to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris&lt;/strong&gt; explains what would have to happen before he attended one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I think perhaps if my wife was out of town, my friends all died, my cat had really bad diarrhea while all the electricity went out leaving my tv and computer useless… and if all my musical instruments were broken along with the disappearance of every writing instrument and paper product and the closing of all music clubs, comedy clubs, cafes and if my telescope was useless due to all the stars in the sky suddenly going black I may be bored enough to go to an atheist meeting…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t attend any regular atheist gatherings in Chicago.  The only thing that sometimes tempts me to go is a good guest speaker.  And possibly knowing that females close to my age will be there.&lt;/p&gt;

I call it "The Camera that Changed the Universe."  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/the_camera_that_changed_the_un.php"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; focused on Hubble showing us just how deep, rich, and full of wonder our Universe is.  Let's remember how this happened.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did was take a patch of sky that was relatively empty.  No bright stars, no large galaxies or clusters, no planetary nebulae, just a little tiny patch of black, empty sky.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/hell_yeah_hubble/Hubble_Deep_Field_location.gif" width="500" alt="Hubble_Deep_Field_location.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we point Hubble at it.  And what do we do?  We sit there.  And wait.  Collecting tiny, miniscule amounts of light.  First, for minutes on end.  And then the minutes turn into hours, and the hours turn into days.  All the while, Hubble just patiently sits there, pointing at the same patch of empty sky.  Over 10 days, Hubble took a photograph of the same exact patch on the sky 342 times.  They then added up the light from all 342 of these images.  The result?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/hell_yeah_hubble/594px-HubbleDeepField.800px.jpg" width="500" alt="594px-HubbleDeepField.800px.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field"&gt;Hubble Deep Field&lt;/a&gt;, taken by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFPC2"&gt;WFPC2&lt;/a&gt;.  Every point of light in this image (except for about 6 which are dim stars) is a galaxy.  Thousands upon thousands of new galaxies were discovered.  Some were only a few million light years away, others were &lt;i&gt;over ten billion&lt;/i&gt; light years away.  All told, we learned that there are &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;one hundred billion galaxies&lt;/b&gt; in our Universe.  And we learned it from this single photograph.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, nearly a decade after this, they installed a new, better camera, called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Camera_for_Surveys"&gt;Advanced Camera for Surveys&lt;/a&gt;.  And to one-up the Hubble Deep Field, they picked a different blank patch of sky, went even &lt;i&gt;deeper&lt;/i&gt;, and created &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field"&gt;the Hubble &lt;i&gt;Ultra&lt;/i&gt; Deep Field&lt;/a&gt;.  Take a look:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/hell_yeah_hubble/hudf.jpg" width="500" alt="hudf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately 10,000 separate galaxies in this tiny little piece of sky.  Well, the good folks at NASA and the ESA have created a &lt;b&gt;3-D flythough simulation&lt;/b&gt; of the image, showing you what it would look like if you actually flew through this image!  Now that you know &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/redshift_and_distance_in_the_e.php"&gt;how distances work in cosmology&lt;/a&gt;, all they had to do was measure the redshift of each galaxy and program it in.  Tony Darnell narrates it, and I've embedded it for you right here!  (You can start at the 2:53 mark if you want to skip the intro.)  And remember, as you watch it, that each dot of light in this image is a galaxy, &lt;b&gt;comparable to our own Milky Way&lt;/b&gt;, with nearly a trillion stars, only one of which is our own Sun.

Those of you who follow me on Twitter &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer/statuses/3055892456"&gt;may know&lt;/a&gt; that a couple of weeks ago I went sightseeing at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado, which sits a few hundred meters from the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. We went just to look around (the mountains are incredible) and to grab lunch — I recommend the elk burger, which is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went outside to soak in the sights, and this cute little guy (gal?) was by the pool looking for some grub too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#bb0000"&gt;People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The minor issue for me is the fact that the NHS does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have what the Republicans allege are "death panels" that judge whether an individual's life is worth living.  (There is a panel that decides if a drug is too expensive relative to the increase in length and quality of life it provides for — there's a limit to the quantities of public money the NHS will spend on supplying expensive drugs for free when they don't do much good.  But that's not about judging individuals' lives.)  No, the real kicker is that the journalists at &lt;em&gt;IBD&lt;/em&gt; didn't even know that Stephen Hawking (long-time holder of the chair that Isaac Newton once held at the University of Cambridge) is a &lt;strong&gt;British&lt;/strong&gt; physicist, and has lived his whole life in Britain!   His motor neurone disease has been constantly and expertly treated under the NHS and he has received constant nursing care (he says, "I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS. I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived").  It's a linguistic issue, of course: it's that damn speech synthesizer Hawking uses.  The people at &lt;em&gt;IBD&lt;/em&gt; have heard it speak his words, but they couldn't tell from its odd and mildly Swedish-flavored enunciation that he is not an American (and that would be the default assumption for anyone brilliant, naturally).  Britain's speech scientists need to work on that synthesizer and get it talking more like Prince Charles.  It looks like Americans' hopes of a reform of their broken health insurance system are going to depend on such things.  If it is left up to &lt;em&gt;IBD&lt;/em&gt;, and the sort of people who think &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1653"&gt;Medicare is going to be taken over by the gov'ment&lt;/a&gt;, all hopes of reform are doomed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;The first two statements mentioned are not as evidently foolish.  Is it true that billboards won’t convert anyone, and if so does that mean that there’s no reason to put up a billboard with an atheist message on it?  Is it true that true-believers of woo and fundie Christians simply cannot be lead to the light by an out skeptic or atheist? To answer this, I think we have to really think about what it takes to profoundly change someone’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it usually happen all at once?  How many times have you profoundly changed your mind right after someone presented a compelling argument against your original point of view?  Maybe you’ve done it once, even twice, but I would be impressed.  I think it’s much more likely that it was a gradual process.  Maybe you found one thing in someone else’s argument that planted that seed of doubt .  You then yourself looked over your religious or political or whatever convictions with this slightly altered viewpoint, and that lead to a few more things becoming problematic that weren’t before.  Over time, you begin rejecting some of your former ideas in favor of new ones, so that eventually you have a radically new point of view.  Maybe it wasn’t one, but several conversations on different topics with different people that lead to this reevaluation of ideas.  Maybe you read something in a book that caused it?  Whatever it was, I think it is very unlikely that one single thing changed someone’s mind, or even that something other than oneself could change one’s own mind.  Changing minds then is often about causing people to look at their ideas with a lens they haven’t used before, or from a point of view they haven’t used before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a billboard really do that?  Sure.  Admittedly, billboards are probably not the most persuasive medium.  You don’t get a lot of depth of thought from billboards, since you have a limited amount of text and/or images that you can put on them.  They do have the advantage of more-or-less forcing you to read them, so even the people who might not pick up a book on science much less atheism will end up reading the brief message the billboard displays.  Is the billboard likely to instantly convert anyone? No, but I don’t think it does absolutely nothing either.  Maybe a few people look at the billboard and say, “huh, look at that there are people who don’t believe in God.”  Maybe they already knew about such people, but don’t think about them much because they never encounter out atheists.  Might this make those people slightly more inclined to pick up “The God Delusion” or “Breaking the Spell?”  I think it probably does. Maybe 1 million people see a well placed billboard message while it’s up.  Maybe 20 of those people pick up &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; who otherwise wouldn’t have and maybe one of those twenty people eventually decides to become an atheist.  Did that billboard convert that person?  Well, not directly, but it did play a part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course all of that is unproven speculation, much like the contention that billboards don’t convert anyone.  My point is not that I know that they do, but that there is a plausible mechanism by which they might.  There are in fact many plausible mechanisms, of which I think awareness raising is the most likely (although they aren’t mutually exclusive).  Of course there are other reasons to put up a billboard.  Awareness raising might end up converting a few, but maybe it’s also likely to increase tolerance shown towards atheism, or make sure we aren’t forgotten in &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/inaugural-address/"&gt;presidential speeches&lt;/a&gt;.  Perhaps it just serves to increase the sense of community among atheists, and perhaps that’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what of the other claim mentioned, the generally accomodationist claim that people won’t listen to or can’t learn from any argument put forth by someone with whom they do not agree on a some issue.  Richard Dawkins could never teach anything to a Baptist because he’s an atheist and he admits it, is basically how that Mooney and Kirshenbaum article linked above reads.  Do we need to go out of our way like Mooney and Kirshenbaum or Eugenie Scott (who’s mostly awesome though so I forgive her) do to tell the religious that they can keep their views and still accept science?  I dont’ think so.  You can simply make statements of fact or well evidenced arguments and someone is going to hear you.  Someone is going to say, “hmm, that’s interesting maybe I should look into that.”  Perhaps they’ll start out trying to disprove it, and maybe they will end up deciding they have, but there are plenty of examples of people ridding themselves of belief in a god because of science and reason so it’s foolish to say that it doesn’t happen.  But does it happen more often if first you tell them that they can keep their religion?  I find that unlikely, although again that’s an unsupported claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a completely different way of looking at things that often gets overlooked in this argument.  That is, that you don’t have to convert the true-believers and the fundies or those 30 years entrenched in their ideas as long as you take a long term view (and who thinks the fight against religious dogmatism or for skeptical inquiry is going to be a quick one?).  The cognitive dissonance in some might be too much to overcome. Instead though, you can take the generational view.  Maybe the older generations are already mostly set in their ways, but the younger ones, kids in their late teens and early twenties are probably not mostly set.  You can move them towards your goal.  You don’t even have to convince all of them to have a profound effect. Maybe you convince 2% of the newer generation to be skeptics or atheists, after having exposed them to many different arguments through many different media.  Well then there’s a few more skeptics in the world to teach the next generation.  Perhaps you’ve also moved a few moderates closer towards skepticism, even if they still hold on to a few sacred cows, and maybe even a few fundies towards a more moderate religion.  What we’ve done is almost like changing the gene frequency in a population.  Ideas get transmitted through people, and most profoundly through parents. Even slightly changing the beliefs of the next generation of parents can end up having a profound cumulative effect.  Next generation you start with a slightly more enlightened population, and you try again.  Then after 5 or 10 generations you will have some real looking change, and this is change that doesn’t involve religious apologetics or other mental gymnastics that really involve ideas that are anti-science (like the idea that you can assert knowledge of something without evidence for it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s important to keep in mind as well.  I don’t just dislike accomodationism and apologetics because they don’t fully conform to my view.  I dislike them because I think they go against what I am arguing for (skeptical inquiry of all things including religion).  Is it possible to construct a belief that doesn’t directly contradict scientific knowledge? Yes. Is it reasonable to believe such a construct?  No, I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to get across is that looking at only the immediate effects of argument is foolish.  Arguments cause people to think about things, and that train of thought can extend well beyond the end of the argument itself. Furthermore, you don’t have to get people to completely agree with you in order to have done some good.  Not only will you have done some good by convincing an individual of one little thing, however small, but you also get the ripple effects of that one little thing now being transmitted by that person, particularly to his/her children should he/she have any.  The defeatist view that arguments are only useful if they instantly convert someone, and that therefore we have to weaken our arguments so that they’re more likely to do something is incredibly short sighted. Convincing a lot of people of anything is not a small task, and it probably requires effort on many different fronts.  What it doesn’t require are ideas that in fact reinforce unscientific thinking like fitting your religious beliefs into the ever shrinking gaps of science.&lt;/p&gt;

Then, I go check my email and I've got a similar number of people sending me this story about a person who could be the next mayor of Tulsa Oklahoma, apparently.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Republican mayoral candidate Anna Falling said Tuesday that putting a Christian creationism display in the Tulsa Zoo is No. 1 in importance among city issues that also include violent crime, budget woes and bumpy streets.

&lt;p&gt;"It's first," she&lt;br&gt;
said to calls of "hallelujah" at a rally outside the zoo. "If we can't come to the foundation of faith in this community, those other answers will never come. We need to first of all recognize the fact that God needs to be honored in this city."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Falling, who has founded several Christian nonprofit groups and is a former city councilor, also said the next mayor needs to appoint people to boards, authorities and commissions who will "honor God."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether she meant that she would recruit Christians to serve the city, Falling said she was talking about "people committed to their churches." When asked whether she meant Christian churches, she said, "churches, yes."&lt;br&gt;

Today’s question comes courtesy of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8711"&gt;Chasmosaur&lt;/a&gt;, who writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So offline, I don’t go by a dinosaur name (surprise!).  I actually have an unusual and gender neutral name, but it’s one more commonly thought of as a boy’s name, not a girl’s.  My parents weren’t being creative – it’s a family name that pops up every few generations (and always on a woman).  As an adult, I embrace my unusual name, but growing up with it wasn’t much fun. And it is still an occasional source of confusion or amusement to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet my name is, by far, not the worst I’ve ever heard or heard of. For example, one of the doctors that practiced in the Washington, DC area where I grew up – who was an excellent doctor and a superlative human being – was an OB-GYN who was named Harry Beaver.  (I wish I was joking about that, but I’m not.  Feel free to Google it.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What’s the most problematic, apropos and/or embarrassing name you’ve ever run across? And…*honestly*…how did you react when you heard it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how &lt;strong&gt;Martin Beckford&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/5977093/Buddhism-is-fastest-growing-religion-in-English-jails-over-past-decade.html"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Christians remain the best represented group behind bars, with 41,839 worshippers, while those declaring themselves to have no religion, or atheist or agnostic views, now stand at 27,710.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s very misleading.  It’s not fair to automatically group “no religion” in with atheists and agnostics in this case.  Sometimes, atheists do include that category in their own numbers in self-identification surveys, but it’s the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No religion” includes people who don’t think about religion and who may have no stance about God whatsoever.  It may also include religious people who don’t want to answer that particular question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume “No religion” is synonymous with “non-theist” is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheists (and even agnostics) do take a position on the nature of God — they have put some thought into it and attached a label to their way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, the 570 atheists in English prisons make up 1% of the population there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That number is still far below the percentage of atheists in the general population, especially in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

However, this discussion has reminded me that, for most people, knowledge about diet and exercise has two sources -- 1) What people believe to be true and 2 )What the there is evidence to support. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/08/put_down_the_water_exercise_an/Sources%20of%20knowledge.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="362" width="500"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What becomes problematic is when a particular idea becomes repeated
frequently enough that the repetition becomes sufficient evidence that
is must be true.  I was reminded of this yesterday while I was at the gym.    I really enjoy &lt;a href="http://yourtotalhealth.ivillage.com/diet-fitness/spinning-101.html"&gt;Spinning&lt;/a&gt; a day or two a week.  I like to Spin because, no matter how hardcore I am, it always manages to kick my ass.  My Spinning workouts are probably my most intense of the week.  I try to spend the hour at &amp;gt;75% of my maximum heart rate and exercise at a workload that I know elicits &amp;gt;80% of my &lt;a href="http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/VO2_max.htm"&gt;VO&lt;font style="font-size:0.64em"&gt;2&lt;font style="font-size:1.25em"&gt;max&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, I tend to sweat like nobody's business.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/08/put_down_the_water_exercise_an/Woman%20Sweating.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/08/put_down_the_water_exercise_an/Woman%20Sweating-thumb-450x298-17446.jpg" alt="Woman Sweating.jpg" height="298" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Dr. Isis post-Spinning&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After yesterday&amp;#39;s class the instructor reminded us all to drink &amp;quot;plenty of water.&amp;quot;  The woman next to me asked, &amp;quot;how much should I drink?&amp;quot; and the instructor replied &amp;quot;as much as you can.  You can never have too much water.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I was reminded about some of the recent comments on my blog and knew I needed to post.  You see, remaining hydrated is important and one of the biggest pieces of advice given to novice athletes and new dieters is to drink &amp;quot;plenty of water&amp;quot;.  Drinking water until we feel like our eyes are floating is one of those pieces of advice that has been repeated so frequently that it almost carries the weight of Gospel.  Remaining hydrated during and after exercise, especially when the weather is warm, is important.  However, it is possible to drink too much water, especially during the summer months, and the consequences of that can be dangerous.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radical methods of augmenting human intelligence is one of those topics that both greatly appeals to me and strikes me as utterly inevitable. The benefits are so easy to imagine, the potential methods for making it happen are both varied and eminently plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that the revolution of mind has already started once you consider what computers have done to augment our intelligence in the past 20 years or the incredible popularity and utility of focus enhancing drugs like modafinil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic article had a great section about what it would be like living in a culture where very high intelligence was as common as hirsute heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…If anything, our arguments will be more intense, buttressed not just by strongly held opinions but by intricate reasoning. People in 2030 will look back aghast at how ridiculously unsubtle the political and cultural disputes of our present were, just as we might today snicker at simplistic advertising from a generation ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the debates of the 2030s would be remarkable for us to behold. Nuance and multiple layers will characterize even casual disputes; our digital assistants will be there to catch any references we might miss. And all of this will be everyday, banal reality. Today, it sounds mind-boggling; by then, it won’t even merit comment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

.... Have you ever had this happen:  You are minding your own business, teaching your life science course, it's early in the term.  A student, on the way out after class (never at the beginning of class, rarely during class) mentions something about "carbon dating."  This usually happens around the time of year you are doing an overview of the main points of the course, but before you've gotten to the "evolution module"...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:right;padding:5px;width:275px"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://gregladen.com/wordpress/wp-content/graphics/jdarc.jpg" width="275"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;  Jeanne d'Arc was a very influential 10th grader.  I understand she gave her Life Science teachers a very hard time. This is the only contemporary depiction of Joan of Arc.  Some say the banner reads "IHS" but I'm pretty sure it says "AIG." &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student is talking about C14 dating and how it "has problems."  But you are a life science teacher and can't think of a single point in your class that you really touch on C14.  Dating in the evolution section does not involve C14.  This is for later time periods, more in the area of archaeology, and you know nothing about it.  So you brush off the question but are left with an uneasy feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next class, probably just after class, the same student, again at a moment that gives you zero warning and usually no time to think of how to respond, mentions something about the Laws of Thermodynamics.  This question you find more interesting and possibly even useful as the starting point of a "teachable moment..."  The nature of life itself includes the fact that life works upstream against entropy.  That one utterly mind-blowing aspect of life is really all you need to define life itself.  If that was the only thing you used to define life, you would have very few non-life entities or events accidentally included.  If you can truly understand ... I mean really, really truly at a detailed level understand .... how the heck life works against the gradient of entropy, then you will understand a LOT (like, at the MA level, at least) of what is going on.  To get a believable and reasonable level of understanding of this, you must get more than just basic cell function ... it is not good enough to just say "The mitochondria are the tiny little powerhouses of the cell" because you have not explained how that works.  You need to know about ATP and stuff.  Really, you even need to know why cells use ATP as energy but none of the other obvious forms of energy that they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use ... the phylogenetic effect at a very &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/what_to_do_with_bible_thumping.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/what_to_do_with_bible_thumping.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/uraw9nkKfxA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250098644277"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/notrocketscience/~3/1e5GhgRxERE/anthrax_bacteria_get_help_from_viruses_and_worms_to_survive.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/299ea1cc96e571a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Anthrax bacteria get help from viruses and worms to survive</title><published>2009-08-12T12:23:02Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T12:23:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/OZ717vUcRS0/anthrax_bacteria_get_help_from_viruses_and_worms_to_survive.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/notrocketscience/~3/1e5GhgRxERE/anthrax_bacteria_get_help_from_viruses_and_worms_to_survive.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">When the bacteria that cause anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) aren&amp;#39;t ravaging livestock or being used in acts of bioterrorism, they spend their lives as dormant spores. In these inert but hardy forms, the bacteria can weather tough environmental conditions while lying in wait for their next host. This is the standard explanation for what B.anthracis does between infections, and it&amp;#39;s too simple by far. It turns out that the bacterium has a far more interesting secret life involving two unusual partners - viruses and earthworms. 

A dying animal can release up to a billion bacterial cells in every single millilitre of blood. This torrent of microbes provides a feast of riches for bacteriophages - viruses that infect bacteria. Raymond Schuch and Vincent Fischetti from the Rockefeller University  have found that the anthrax bacterium depends on becoming infected by phages. They began by isolating several strains of phages that specifically infect B.anthracis. The viruses hailed from a range of sources, including the soil, plant roots and worm guts. &amp;lt;

When these phages find bacterial targets, they inject their own DNA, which insinuates itself into the genome of the host. This process is called lysogeny and it is essential for the bacterium&amp;#39;s survival. The added viral DNA encodes proteins called sigma factors that change how bacterial genes are switched on. In doing so, they change the behaviour of the bacteria, giving them new abilities that boost their survival and allow them to colonise an intermediate host - the earthworm. 

With their newly incorporated viral DNA, some bacteria formed spores while others were actually prevented from doing so, depending on the phage. Regardless, all the anthrax bacteria grew at almost twice the rate. The phage DNA brought out the social side of the bacteria, inducing them to cluster in groups. It also made them more likely to secreted more complex sugar molecules that form the building blocks of biofilms - the bacterial equivalent of towns and cities. Amid this matrix of sugars, the cells find shelter and protection. 

Small wonder then that the infected bacteria are much better are surviving for long durations. Their advantage was so great in comparison to virus-free strains that Schuch and Fischetti suggest that phage infections may actually be necessary if anthrax bacteria are to survive in soil. Indeed, duo identified three bacterial genes that are activated by the phages and that are necessary for eking out a living in soil. When they inactivated these genes, the bacteria survived in these environments for the briefest of times.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The American Psychological Association adopted a resolution Wednesday stating that mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this review, the task force recommended that mental health professionals avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts when providing assistance to people distressed about their own or others’ sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task force examined the peer-reviewed journal articles in English from 1960 to 2007, which included 83 studies. Most of the studies were conducted before 1978, and only a few had been conducted in the last 10 years. The group also reviewed the recent literature on the psychology of sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, much of the research in the area of sexual orientation change contains serious design flaws,” Glassgold said. “Few studies could be considered methodologically sound and none systematically evaluated potential harms.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glassgold went on to talk about the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/06gay.html"&gt;implications of the APA resolution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Both sides have to educate themselves better,” Ms. Glassgold said. “The religious psychotherapists have to open up their eyes to the potential positive aspects of being gay or lesbian. Secular therapists have to recognize that some people will choose their faith over their sexuality.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds about right.  Gay people are born that way and some are deluded into thinking that can change.  As &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/08/125-4.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/strong&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, “The point of the gay rights movement is not to encourage people to be gay. It is to enlarge the scope of freedom so that more people, gay and straight and bi and trans, can be &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;. With dignity and respect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how are conservative Christians reacting to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re &lt;a href="http://www.citizenlink.org/content/A000010667.cfm"&gt;not about to change anything&lt;/a&gt;, of course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The APA is really failing to not only represent science, which is its primary responsibility,” [Dr. Joe Nicolosi, founder and director of the Thomas Aquinas Psychological Clinic,] said, “but it’s also failing to inform people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines do allow for difference in religious beliefs, but Jeff Johnston, gender issues analyst for Focus on the Family, said they don’t go far enough.  He said the APA is starting with the false assumption that homosexuality is normal and positive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer Christians allow this charade to go on within their own churches, the faster they will drive people away from their faith.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, this is bittersweet.  They’re digging their own grave, which is not a bad thing, and yet I’d rather see them face the facts and reach out positively to gay people.  They have the potential to do a lot of good despite their irrational beliefs.  Yet, they have no desire to — if I may say it — be “Christian” about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part of our trip to the Creation “Museum” we saw a presentation called &lt;em&gt;The Ultimate Proof of Creationism&lt;/em&gt; or some such.  To our collective lack of surprise, it was nothing of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presentation – and a consistent theme in the museum – was the notion that everyone is looking at the same facts, but we come to the table with different presuppositions.  We secularists have an inaccurate view, the museum argued, because we start with the assumption that 1) our observations are generally accurate and 2) that the past is an indication of the future.  We can’t prove these, so they’re unfounded and arbitrary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course… these are SHARED assumptions among creationists as well, but they add another axiom.  Biblical literalists assume that the Bible is the true word of god.  And that assumption is supported because… wait for it… it says so in the Bible!  Yes, that’s right, they’re pointing to circular reasoning as a superior starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Circular Reasoning" src="http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs140.snc1/5969_719337619508_2705716_42875667_2043723_n.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="604" align="center"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How absurd. But at least the system has no inconsistencies!  It’s internally supported (read: circular).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a thought experiment: I have another “starting point” through which I’ll interpret my evidence.  &lt;strong&gt;Instead of trusting fidelity to the Bible as the ultimate judge of truth, we should just trust whatever I say!  Let’s assume that everything I say from now on is true.&lt;/strong&gt; How do I know it’s true?  Because I just said so.  And remember, we’re starting with the assumption that I’m right.  By the way, I say that I’m perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human reason and observation tell us that I have many flaws – among them a tendency to be sarcastic.  But we shouldn’t put Human reason above The Word of Jesse, as The Word of Jesse is the ultimate standard of truth.  Sarcasm must be part of perfection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Word of Jesse also asserts that you’re all excellent, amazing people.  Doesn’t it feel good to have this worldview?&lt;/p&gt;

They are both evangelical Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron says he wanted to answer the question: “What would it be like to be a Christian and a fly on the wall as a group of atheists peered at exhibits that attempted to prove them wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit, that’s a pretty cool experiment on his end.  Almost like an atheist visiting churches…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after he put on his Secular Student Alliance nametag, what did he find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href="http://pastoraaron.info/2009/08/11/scarlet-a-for-a-day/"&gt;appalled at the way other Christians treated us atheists&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… While I did not have a T-shirt (a symbol anyway) it was obvious that there was a distinctive way that we were being treated because of the shared identification.  There were hateful glances, exaggerated perceptions, waxing surveillance by security, and anxious but strong ‘amens’ accompanying a lecture on “The Ultimate Proof of Creation” by Dr. Jason Lisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this how Christians treat people?  Is this how we follow Jesus’ commandment to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us?  I cannot help but think that many Christians are fearful of atheists.  It is a sort of xenophobia that runs along lines of faith and belief.  What we tend to forget is that atheists, agnostics, and evolutionists are people too.  If our attempt to preserve our belief means that we are treating these people like animals, are we really holding up principles that are based on a creation worldview?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There have rarely been times in my life that I have been ashamed of people that I call “brothers and sisters in Christ.”  This was one of them…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for stepping in our shoes, Aaron.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope he can take that message back to his church and Christian friends.&lt;/p&gt;

Real science requires time, patience, modesty, and a high tolerance for failure.  Good ideas can lead to better ideas, or to dead ends, and these dead ends actually help us map out our reality.  Quite a while back, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2007/11/mmmmchocolate_flavinol_actuall.php"&gt;I wrote about a study of certain compounds in chocolate&lt;/a&gt; and their effect on the cardiovascular system.  One of the things I liked most about the study was the authors' refusal to draw overly broad, immodest conclusions from their findings.  That's how real scientists operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in stark contrast to undereducated pseudo-scientists---if they see a result congruent with their beliefs, it's cannon.  There's no situation or population that can't benefit from their "discovery".  Once again, the Huffington Post's&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/7-healthy-reasons-to-enjo_b_257159.html"&gt; Patricia Fitzgerald gives us a nice example of the phenomenon.&lt;/a&gt;  She lists seven reasons not to feel "guilty" about enjoying chocolate.  This beats my one reason---it's not good to feel guilty about the food you consume.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of her reasons is based on scant evidence taken to outrageous extremes.  Her first claim is that chocolate is high in "anti-oxidants" and from there she concludes that it's good for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her second claim is that it "helps with cholesterol" and to support this claim she links to a press release of a small pilot study of LDL oxidative characteristics.  There is no clinical relevance to this study (which doesn't rule out future clinical relevance, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her third claim is that it reduces "inflammation", and once again she links to a press release of CRP measurements.  As we've previously discussed, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/magic.php"&gt;"inflammation" is not magic,&lt;/a&gt; and real scientists will incorporate this interesting finding into future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also cites a study of chocolate and hypertension, and mood, etc, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look.  Very few substances are so bad for you that they should be avoided completely.  Conversely, very few substances are so good for you that they should be consumed like medicine (with the exception of...er...medicine).   To find a &lt;i&gt;clinical&lt;/i&gt; benefit to something, it has to be tested for plausibility, safety, and efficacy.  You can't just say that because 23 people derived some sort of benefit that you should go buy now now now.  A real study, with clear, relevant endpoints, controlled for confounding variables needs to be done to draw these kinds of conclusions.  Numbers matter.  What if it turns out that chocolate actually raises HbA1C?  What if it turns out that even though it lowers CRP it increases mortality?  What if it decreases blood pressure but with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 20,000?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is hard.  Fitzgerald is not only unqualified to practice science; she's unqualified to even &lt;i&gt;talk&lt;/i&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/leaping_off_the_cliff_of_immod.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/FsWAAnpRFnw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250092669705"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/health_care_reform_nazi_euthanasia_the_e.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e755264eadc701d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Health care reform = Nazi euthanasia: The equivalent of Holocaust denial?</title><published>2009-08-12T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/6Dcsm9JiqMU/health_care_reform_nazi_euthanasia_the_e.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/health_care_reform_nazi_euthanasia_the_e.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hadn't planned on writing about this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/the_latest_obama_hitler_shenanigans_too.php"&gt;topic again&lt;/a&gt;. Really, I hadn't. The reason is mainly that politics is usually not my bag. I've said it time and time again: political bloggers are a dime a dozen, and I have no reason to suspect that my pontifications and bloviations on politics would be any more valuable or worthy of your attention than anyone else's pontifications and bloviations on politics. Besides, I've made quite the little niche for myself in the blogosphere writing about skepticism, critical thinking, and science in medicine, in particular how unscientific or pseudoscientific health care modalities are increasingly finding their way into medicine. Shockingly, even to someone as full of himself (at least on the blog) as I am, I even appear to have become one of a handful of go-to bloggers when it comes to the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/medicine/antivaccination_lunacy/"&gt;anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt;. All of this represents a good place to be if you're a blogger, so much so that it even got me a gig being on a panel at TAM7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, another topic that I've had an intense interest in since the very beginning of this blog, a topic I first &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/how_i_discovered_holocaust_denial.php"&gt;wrote about way back in January 2005&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, when I wrote &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/the_latest_obama_hitler_shenanigans_too.php"&gt;snarky posts&lt;/a&gt; about how the opponents of President Obama's healthcare reform initiative have been delving deeply into Godwin territory, I hadn't thought that there might be a connection between my interest in skepticism and critical thinking as applied to medicine and Holocaust denial. I hadn't thought that there would be a way to link Holocaust denial with the sheer idiocy coming from the right about how President Obama supposedly wants to euthanize your babies and kill your grandma. But I should have. Fortunately, for me, a man whom I greatly admire, bioethicist Arthur Caplan &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32372258/ns/health-health_care/"&gt;showed me the error of my ways&lt;/a&gt; (or at least the limitations of my vision):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/health_care_reform_nazi_euthanasia_the_e.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/health_care_reform_nazi_euthanasia_the_e.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/6Dcsm9JiqMU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250092197051"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/08/12/must-science-declare-a-holy-war-on-religion/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8b1543c83d195066</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Religion"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">Must Science Declare a Holy War on Religion?</title><published>2009-08-12T15:24:06Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T15:24:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/08/12/must-science-declare-a-holy-war-on-religion/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We think &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-mooney11-2009aug11,0,6581208.story"&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IowaBus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IowaBus.jpg" alt="IowaBus" title="IowaBus" width="550" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was taken down on account of being offensive, &lt;strong&gt;Governor Chet Culver&lt;/strong&gt; decided to chime in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I was disturbed personally by the advertisement and I can understand why other Iowans were also disturbed by the message.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never explained what about it was so disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the ads are back up, maybe the governor would like to explain himself?  He hasn’t yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;strong&gt;Rekha Basu&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Des Moines Register&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090812/OPINION01/908120327/1001/NEWS"&gt;calls him out on this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The whole embarrassing debacle projects an image of a confused and self-contradicting DART leadership, and a governor who has deliberately chosen not to represent one segment of Iowa society: the non-church-going. This makes it hard to claim we’re a welcoming and pluralistic state where debate and discussion on a variety of issues can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could possibly be offensive to Culver about someone else not believing in God and saying so? Even if the governor is deeply religious himself, he can’t expect all Iowans to share his beliefs. The ad didn’t put down anyone else’s faith. Its goal, according to the association’s president, was to let non-religious people know “that they too have a community if they want to join it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is how you deal with them. Culver should apologize, declare this a teachable moment and give the atheists a hearing. Their place or his, beer optional, open mind essential.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not holding my breath, but if Culver apologizes, it would be great publicity for both he and the atheist group.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Numerous studies have extolled the benefits of marriage on overall morbidity and mortality, but a recent study reports that mental health may, in fact, be preserved, in married people.

One of their colony-mates is trapped in a snare - a nylon thread that dastardly researchers have looped around its waist and half-buried in some sand. Thankfully, help is at hand. A crack squad of rescuers work together to dig away at the sand, expose the snare, and bite at the threads until their colleague is liberated.

Many animals help each other but actual rescue attempts, even between individuals of the same species, are rarely documented. Among back-boned animals, dolphins are famously said to help injured comrades by supporting them at the surface so that they can breathe more easily, and a lone capuchin monkey was documented to save a mother and baby from attack by a rival group.

Then, there are ants. As early as 1874, biologists noted that ants will often dig out fellows that have sunk too deeply into sand and later studies showed that they'll also drag others out by their legs. But both limb-pulling and sand-digging are very simple actions, that could be triggered by chemical alarms released by stressed ants. You could imagine that workers have a simple programme that says "Follow the alarm smell until you find its source, then dig and pull."

But it's very hard to see how such simple rules could direct rescuers to uncover and bite through a nylon snare. These escapades show that ants can launch rescues that are more sophisticated and exact that anything previously reported.

Now trying doing that without moving.

Of course, this is the problem faced by many plants. Some of the most successful, flowering plants, use animals to overcome this. But the addition of pollinators into the reproductive mix doesn’t change that there are differences in the interests of male and female plants. As in many animals. males are thought to be capable of producing more gametes, so gain greater reproductive success by dispersing as much pollen as possible....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The paper is on Apotemnophilia (phew!! saying it is a task in itself), which yours truly had never heard of before. In any case, the disease is characterized by the desire to amputate one&amp;#39;s own limb (Now how about that). These patients are otherwise mentally normal.Individuals suffering from apotemnophilia always date the desire for amputation since childhood and often term the limb as being over-present or intrusive. Most obtain an amputation and paradoxically report feeling much more &amp;#39;complete&amp;#39; and happier. Traditional explanations for the disease range from it being sexual paraphilia, related to the phallic resemblance of an amputee&amp;#39;s stump (Someone get Freud in here!) or perhaps the mere sight of an amputee is permanently imprinted in the malleable psyche of a child as the &amp;quot;ideal body representation&amp;quot;In this paper (McGeoch et. al (2009)), they demonstrate that the disease actually has a neurological basis based on the following observations:1) Sufferers have no other psychological disorders2) They desire an amputation of a limb at a specific level3) There is a left sided bias.The last observation points a finger to one particular area in the right parietal lobe called the superior parietal lobe (SPL) which receives connections from a host of other areas, namely the visual, primary somatosensory, secondary somatosensory, premotor and motor cortices. Additionally, the right parietal cortex is known to play a vital role in constructing body image and damage can lead to various disorders like somatoparaphrenia (denial of ownership of left arm) and others. The autors postulate that the right SPL may contain a hardwired representation of the body and if a particular limb were missing from the representation, the consequence may be a desire for amputation.Right hemisphere of averaged control brain (a,b)and subject brain (c,d). Right SPL is outlined in black. Images a and c show touch to the left footof control and subject respectively while b and dshow touch to the right foot of control and subject respectively . This subject wanted right below-kneeamputation (McGeoch et. al (2009)) This confirms the hypothesis that there is a congenital failure to represent affected limbs in the body image. Since visual and somatosensory inputs are still intact, but there is no corresponding  limb representation, the result would be a mismatch that manifests itself as an intrusive and over-present limb.ReferencesMcGeoch, P.D., Brang, D., Song, T., Lee, R.R., Huang, M., &amp;amp; Ramachandran, V.S.

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be speaking next week at &lt;a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/"&gt;Gnomedex&lt;/a&gt;, a premier tech conference held annually in Seattle and run by my friend the übergeek Chris Pirillo (and I mean that in a good way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be talking about the spread of information and misinformation through social media, specifically Twitter. Remember the Texas fireball, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/15/texas-fireball-whats-known-so-far/"&gt;and how the (wrong) idea that it was debris from a satellite collision spread like wildfire on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;? That’s the sort of thing I’ll be discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also going to talk about other social media/networks like &lt;a href="http://www.digg.com"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. I happen to find both of those sites useful, but both have their disadvantages too. This blog gets linked commonly from both, and I’m looking into trending and such on them. But I want to get opinions from people who have used one or both of them: what do you like and dislike about them? Which one (if either) is easier to use, has more reliable commenting, links to better stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d post this on those sites, but that would be like walking into an Apple store and declaring IE 8 to be the best browser ever. I prefer to keep any firefights local, thankyouverymuch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me know what you think in the comments below!

The first is marketing – they are an attempt at rebranding methods that do not meet the usual standards of unqualified “medicine”. The second is a very deliberate and often calculating attempt at creating a double standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a standard of care within medicine, and although its application is imperfect its principles are clear – the best available scientific evidence should be used to determine that medical interventions meet a minimum standard of safety and effectiveness. Regulations have largely (although also imperfectly) reflected that principle, as have academia, publishing standards, professional organizations, licensing boards, and product regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the creation of the new brand of medicine (CAM and integrative) came the opportunity to change the rules of science and medicine to create an alternative standard, one tailor made for those modalities that do not meet existing scientific and even ethical standards for medicine. This manifests in many ways – the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=402"&gt;NCCAM&lt;/a&gt; was created so that these modalities would have an alternate standard for garnering federal dollars for research. Many states now have “health care freedom laws” which create a separate standard of care (actually an elimination of the standard of care) for self-proclaimed “alternative” practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most insidious and damaging double-standard that is being advocated under the banner of CAM is a separate standard of scientific research itself. The normal rules of research that have evolved over the last few centuries are being subtly altered or discarded, with clever newspeak. It is a way for proponents to choose their evidence, rather than having the evidence decide what works and what does not work. We saw this strategy at play with the recent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=492"&gt;acupuncture study for back pain&lt;/a&gt; that clearly showed acupuncture was no more effective than placebo acupuncture. Proponents (propagated by an uncritical media) turned scientific logic on its head by interpreting this result as indicating that placebo acupuncture must work also (if only we could figure out how, they unconvincingly mused).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this strategy at work also with the use of so-called “pragmatic” studies – a rebranding of “unblinded” studies. This is a way to choose their evidence – in this case, poorly controlled unblinded studies that are more likely to reflect the bias of the researchers and therefore give them a result that they like. This is their reaction to well-designed placebo controlled trials that show their preferred modality does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to change the meaning of the concept of placebo effects. This one was ready-made, and most people grossly misunderstand the nature of “the” placebo effect. One of my first articles for SBM was about &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=24"&gt;the placebo effect&lt;/a&gt; because this concept is so criticial to science-based medicine. To summarize – the placebo effect is really many effects. It is everything other than a physiological response to the treatment. It is not all a real effect of mind-over-matter – it includes every bias and artifact of observation as well. It includes things like subjects reporting they feel better to the researcher because they want the treatment to work and they want to please the authority figure, who also wants the treatment to work and may be encouraging the perception of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is most important to understand how the term “placebo effect” is used in the context of a controlled clinical trial. Scientific methodology is about controlling variables – because we want to know which variables work and which ones do not. In any clinical scenario there are a multitude of variables that may affect the outcome or the perception of the outcome. Therefore a well-designed study maximally controls all the variables – ideally so that the one variable of interest (the treatment) is completely isolated. This is accomplished in a number of ways. One method is randomization – randomly assigning subjects to the various treatment and placebo arms of a clinical trial. Randomization combined with sufficiently large trial size (number of subjects) results in all variables not specifically controlled for averaging out among the various arms. Another way to look at is that randomization prevents systematic biases in who gets treated and who gets a placebo from affecting the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method of controlling variables is the double-blind placebo control. Ideally one group of subjects will receive the treatment being studied while another group will receive a treatment that is identical in every way except that it is inert (i.e. it controls for all possible variables and isolated the one variable of interest – the treatment). Both the subject and the examiner are blinded to which is which to control for psychological effects. In order to conclude that the treatment “works” those subject receiving the active treatment must do statistically significantly better than those receiving the placebo. If the activity of the treatment was the only variable, then we can confidently conclude it was responsible for the improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is all very basic, but it is these very basic concepts that are being challenged by proponents of so-called CAM. They are trying to say the the effect measured in the placebo arm of such studies is a real effect, something valuable and alone is sufficient to justify the treatment. This philosophy has been termed by critics “placebo medicine” and is just the latest attempt at creating a double standard. But the claim is utterly ignorant of the scientific nature of the placebo effect. It is a method of controlling for biases, artifacts, and variables (known and unknown) – it is not a real effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some non-specific therapeutic effects mixed into placebo effects. For example, people who are being studied tend to take better care of themselves and are more compliant with treatments (because they are being watched). They may also feel better as a result of the positive attention from a health care provider – old-fashioned good bedside manner. These are some of the variables being controlled for. But it is scientifically absurd to argue that they justify an ineffective treatment. But that is exactly what CAM proponents are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest manifestation of this strategy is a report put out in the UK by The Kings Fund – a health policy charity. They put together a committee to examine how the UK can find evidence to support CAM therapies. They are not interested in figuring out “if” such treatments work, but rather how they can show “that” they work. &lt;a href="http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/what_we_do/press/press_releases/complementary_meds.html"&gt;They report:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the need for different types of research when assessing complementary practice, Professor Dame Carol Black said: ‘It has become widely accepted that a stronger evidence base is needed if we are to reach a better understanding of complementary practices and ensure greater confidence in their clinical and cost effectiveness. The challenge is to develop methods of research that allow us to assess the value of an approach that seeks to integrate the physical intervention, the personal context in which it is given, and non-specific effects that together comprise a particular therapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got that? We need new kinds of research (read “double standard”) in order to demonstrate the value of these special CAM practices. The reason that we need to find new ways to demonstrate their value is because they fail under the accepted scientific methods. The last sentence is just a fancy way of saying that placebo effects should count as real effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=23&amp;amp;storycode=4123423&amp;amp;c=1#"&gt;It further says:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘As long as findings from research can provide confidence in the positive effect of the physical intervention at the heart of the treatment, then any added benefit brought by the therapeutic relationship and the context for treatment should count as part of the treatment effect,’ the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘For complementary therapies such a holistic approach to effectiveness should be adopted by bodies such as NICE, when comparing cost-effectiveness across a range of treatments.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “physical intervention at the heart of the treatment” is functionally the same thing as – non-specific placebo effects. They want to take a “holistic” approach to evidence (another useful marketing brand), meaning they get to decide what the evidence means. George Orwell would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Edzard Ernst (the go to expert for the media) gets it exactly right. &lt;a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=23&amp;amp;storycode=4123423&amp;amp;c=1#"&gt;He is quoted as saying:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘This is the introduction of double standards through the back door.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In this case we might as well allow an ineffective medication on the market, because it too will have a placebo effect.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That latter point is a favorite of mine as well. Whenever CAM proponents try to change the rules of science to suit their needs, I invite my readers to imagine a pharmaceutical company getting away with the same thing (not that they wouldn’t want to if they could). Imagine a drug that works no better than placebo in well-designed clinical trials and the company trying to get FDA approval on the grounds that their drug has a valuable placebo effect, even if it is physiologically worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integrity of science-based medicine is critical to the health of the public, the legitimacy of modern medicine, and also the economic health of modern society (as is being forcefully argued recently). We need to have one scientific standard that is fair, rational, and scientifically sound. The creation of a double standard for proponents of modalities that do not meet the very reasonable standards of scientific medicine is eroding the standard of care and the integrity of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public, the media, politicians, and regulators should not fall for the deceptive language that is being used to disguise the truth of these efforts to undermine science-based medicine. This is a brass attempt at changing the rules of science to meet their perceived needs. When you change the rules of science you no longer have science – you have pseudoscience or something even more nefarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; My name is Nikki and I am a christian. I am 15 and very involved in my youth group and last week we were on a mission trip in kentucky. We went to the creation museum a few days before you did. I was looking for the museum's website when i somehow found an article about you and your visit.. After looking at your blog i have come to the conclusion that nothing anyone says will change your mind on how you believe things work and about god.. Though being the gutsy girl i am, i am asking you to give me a chance and have a conversation with me about god and creation. I dont want to try to change your mind(because i know thats impossible) or anything, i just want to try to understand atheists opinions. I know you are busy being a professor and such, but i would really appreciate a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not really interested in an email conversation, so instead I've sent her a reply with a link to this post right here, and a suggestion that she carry on a discussion with a whole group of atheists and agnostics and even a few of the Christians who hang out here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she shows up, try to be nice, and please…let&amp;#39;s avoid Prince references.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_get_email_40.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/YyLcB56i6sM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250080938757"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/entreaties_misaddressed_may_no.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c46f26d978b21326</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Entreaties misaddressed may not be recognized</title><published>2009-08-12T13:18:42Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T13:18:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/KCwj4-RPgg4/entreaties_misaddressed_may_no.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/entreaties_misaddressed_may_no.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't you know it, even the &lt;a href="http://stuffgodhates.com/2009/08/pz-meyers-should-apologize-to-ken-ham/"&gt;omniscient lord of the cosmos can't spell my name right&lt;/a&gt;.

The meeting this past weekend, for instance, was for training student representatives in how to grow and maintain their campus groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have good news and bad news, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the good news, and it is exceptional, wonderful, excellent news: secular student groups are booming, popping up all over the place, and there's no end in sight. Look how SSA has grown:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/the_ssa_needs_you/goodnews.jpeg" width="396" height="440" alt="goodnews.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The bad news, though, is a common problem for non-profits everywhere — the economy is doing poorly, and donations are declining. They are entirely dependent on the generosity of the supporters of freethought, and we&amp;#39;re all feeling the pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/the_ssa_needs_you/badnews.jpeg" width="410" height="440" alt="badnews.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/join"&gt;make a donation or join&lt;/a&gt; — every little bit helps. There are a lot of us and our numbers are growing, and if we all just shared a little, then maybe income would be a slightly better approximation to membership growth.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the funny things about the Universe is, there’s only one way to be right, but an infinite number of ways to be wrong. For example, I know that the science of astronomy is getting better every day at describing the overall state of the Universe, approaching the ability to describe just how things work. We may never achieve that ultimate goal, but we get ever closer. Moreover, I know that astrology is completely wrong, and provably so. Even better, there are a hundred different flavors of astrology, each of which claims to work, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;yet none of which actually does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? One way to be right, lots of ways to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once you slip off that narrow path of reality, you are surrounded by an infinitely deep fog of nonsense which just gets thicker and more difficult to navigate the farther off the path you stray. I suspect there is no actual wrongest thing in the vast reaches of antiscience, because its illogic goes on forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I had to choose, I bet reverse speech would be in the Top Ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3679456673/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2662/3679456673_81e7e23149.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know this idea; you take what someone says, reverse it, and find out that Paul McCartney is actually Bigfoot. Or something like that. The people who claim this is real — and yeah, they’re out there, and just as earnest as any other zealot who kneels at The Pulpit Of Nonsense — never give a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; why this works, or a mechanism that explains how reversing the time variable in a recording should yield anything but comical noises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know why this stuff &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to work when it’s presented to you: if someone primes you with a phrase that they want you to hear when speech is reversed, it really does sound like what they claim. Of course, if they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; tell you what it is, ten different people will come up with ten different phrases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why should logic, reason, and mechanics stop someone from just making stuff up? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the hilarity that is the EVP Reverse Speaking website. They claim that by reversing your speech you can learn The Great Truths (which, if it were true, would be that reverse speech is really, really silly). They even have examples! And what examples they have, oh yes indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evpreversespeaking.com/2009/07/01/the-amazing-randi-reversed-and-one-from-michael-shermer/"&gt;On this page, they reverse my own speech&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, your host and Beloved Internet Personality™. And not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; me, but also sound bites from Randi and Michael Shermer, just to hit a skeptical trifecta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I hate to make fun of people, but at some point, really, it’s simply impossible not to. In this case, this stuff is truly well and remarkably ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example: they start with an interview I did with Randi at TAM 5.  They take the audio, reverse it, and make claims that are… well, here. Listen for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evpreversespeaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/amazing-randy-2-their-walls-hit-forward.mp3"&gt;Forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evpreversespeaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/amazing-randy-2-their-walls-hit.mp3"&gt;Reverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you listen? Try again, a couple of times. What did I say, reversed? They claim I said, &amp;quot;Their walls hit,&amp;quot; clearly meaning Randi hit an astral wall when he had his heart attack a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, &lt;em&gt;yeah&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny. To me it sounds like I’m saying, &amp;quot;They’re all sh*t,&amp;quot; which, had they made that claim, might actually sway me to their side. Just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best part? &lt;em&gt;They didn’t even excerpt the whole sentence I said!&lt;/em&gt; They cut the last bit of the sentence out, so what they use is, &amp;quot;Thanks a lot, Rand.&amp;quot; Note the missing &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; at the end; not &lt;em&gt;Randi&lt;/em&gt;, just Rand. So they had to edit out part of Randi’s name to make their point… whatever the heck their point is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the site is full of incomprehensible gobbledygook just like that. It’s like someone took a bunch of ideas, wrote them down on postcards, cut them up into bits, rearranged them, and then created a website based on what they found. I suggest, dear reader, that you take a look around there. It will remind you of just how silly claims can be, and just how far we skeptics have to go.&lt;/p&gt;

And in case you did not quite understand the headline, they say it again in the subhead: "Dogs are as intelligent as the average two-year-old child, according to research by animal psychologists."  It is bylined "By Richard Gray, Science Correspondent".  (Science Correspondent!  He almost certainly has a Master's degree, possibly in Science!)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research conducted at Language Log Plaza has shown a somewhat different result.  Dogs are not as bright linguistically as a human two-year-old. But what is true is that dogs have the same general intelligence and ability to detect bullshit as the average Science Correspondent for the &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; or BBC News.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The details Mr. Gray reports are that "Researchers have found that dogs are capable of understanding up to 250 words and gestures, can count up to five and can perform simple mathematical calculations."  And in case you (or your dog) did not quite understand that, it is repeated in more detail for you:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; "The average dog is about as bright linguistically as a human two-year-old," said Professor Stanley Coren, a leading expert on canine intelligence at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who has carried out the work.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This means they can understand about 165 words, signs and signals. Those in the top 20 per cent were able to understand as many as 250 words and signals, which is about the same as a two and a half year old.   &lt;p&gt;"Obviously we are not going to be able to sit down and have a conversation with a dog, but like a two-year-old, they show that they can understand words and gestures." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The evidence of understanding words comes from experiments in which a border collie was trained to go and fetch a ball when "Ball!" was shouted at it, and so on for other medium-sized fetchables.  (Ah, border collies.  Long-time Language Log readers will recall that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001039.html"&gt;we have been here before&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the evidence of mathematical calculations was that a trained border collie can work out the square root of an arbitrary integer written on a chalkboard, to an accuracy of at least three decimal places.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No it wasn't.  I said that just to see if you were paying attention. If you're a &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; reader you probably believed me.  The evidence was from differential gaze experiments: if you drop three doggie treats behind a screen and then surreptitiously remove one or two before shifting the screen, a dog looks a little bit longer at the remaining treat or treats than it does when all three are still there like they should have been.  They are capable of noticing, in other words, when slightly weird shit is going down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this all satisfies you — if you now think border collies can understand the meaning of lexical items and do mental arithmetic — then Professor Coren has won his game of spoof the public.  But it has left me wondering whether I will be reading stories about lexical item acquisition in dogs and other &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000400.html"&gt;stupid fake pet communication tricks&lt;/a&gt; until my dying day, or whether one day we will wake up on a bright new morning and Science Correspondents will have realized that they don't have to just paraphrase the press release put out at the APA convention, they can ask a few penetrating questions about what it means to understand the meaning of a word. (Like, could a dog understand an adverb, such as "surreptitiously"? Why is it always nouns and verbs triggering trained physical actions like fetching?  I understand the noun "turd", but if you say it to me I don't run to try and find one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;[Hat tip: Brian Davies.]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any other resources you’d like to recommend on this topic? Sources of photos? I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a discussion point: is using a photo like this–now shocking and reaction provoking–acceptable in materials designed to discuss conservation of larger bird species that were hunted?&lt;/p&gt;

Originally circulated in May, it was reissued again in July. The document contains elements of sensible advice scalped from the the Department of Health ("&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_080839"&gt;Catch it, Bin it, Kill it&lt;/a&gt;") blended with outrageous nonsense of a more profitable kind. For instance, here is founder Julie Foster's recipe for a "sanitiser room spray":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...as above but add 5 ml of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.potions.co.uk/product.php?xProd=40&amp;amp;xSec=2"&gt;Geranium&lt;/a&gt; to the vodka and top up the mix with 100ml of water. Use in a spray or tie pre-soaked ribbons to the bars of a domestic fan to diffuse into the room.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What is Geranium?", I hear you ask. Well, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.potions.co.uk/product.php?xProd=40&amp;amp;xSec=2"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Potions &amp;amp; Possibilities website, it&amp;#39;s a fragrant oil that &amp;quot;has a close affinity with the female system&amp;quot; and is &amp;quot;emotionally soothing&amp;quot;. If that doesn&amp;#39;t get rid of airborne flu virus, I don&amp;#39;t know what will!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tea tree oil features heavily in Foster's advice, undoubtedly because it has known anti-microbial properties. Foster seems to believe that it is "the most powerful antiseptic known to man" which explains why the Army used it to eradicate anthrax spores from Gruinard Island. Oh no, wait, that was formaldehyde, wasn't it? My bad. Still, if you're infected with the early stages of swine flu, Foster believes that the smell alone of tea tree oil will protect you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Apply a few drops of premium, therapeutic Tea Tree Oil onto the fabric between bra cups or on outer clothing at the neck where it won't show. Your body's heat causes the Tea Tree to rise so that you are constantly breathing in this amazing oil with its antiviral and antibacterial powers.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Potions &amp;amp; Possibilities also produce a range of herbal soaps in conjunction with that cathedral to alternative nonsense, the Royal Palaces. Herbs are harvested from the royal gardens and processed in Suffolk for sale in palace shops. In a perfect world, someone with the power and education that comes with such a fortuitous accident of birth would be living up to his title as Protector and saving us from charlatans like Foster. As it is, the Prince is &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466"&gt;a dogmatic defender of indulgent make-believe&lt;/a&gt;, and it's up to broke state school guttersnipes like me to point out the fantasies touted by herb sellers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julie Foster says she is available for additional comment and expert aromatherapy and natural health advice. Perhaps you could ask her for evidence to support her claims for aromatherapy as an effective prophylactic against swine flu.

&lt;p&gt;And Ken Ham of AiG is personally pissed off that PZ Myers would have the audacity of point out that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_think_we_successfully_poked.php"&gt;one of his “museum” displays is a relic of a racist theory of human origins, even though it does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s the same accomodationist crap they’ve been spouting for awhile now, except now they’re launching into a preemptive attack on Richard Dawkins’ upcoming book, &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/em&gt;, which as far as I’m aware is not another “New Atheist” book but is actually supposed to be exactly what M&amp;amp;K claim they want, a book that communicates science in a way that connects with readers and doesn’t attack their religion. So what are M&amp;amp;K complaining about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M&amp;amp;K suffer from the same problem that I find with uber-pacifists and New Age people:  the paradox of paradise. They call for a non-confrontational approach to things and desire an ideal world where everyone just gets along but they themselves create conflict with their own critics because they realize their ideal world can’t co-exist with dissenting views. So those most advocating non-confrontationalism pick fights with those who disagree with their philosophy and see merit in certain conflicts.  Hence the fact that in addition to criticizing Dawkins, they go after their other favorite targets, PZ Myers and Jerry Coyne. So they gave your book bad reviews because they found your conclusions superficial and naive? Get over it already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that another big promoter of this accomodationist approach of “framing” science, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/dont_be_such_a_scientist_talki.php"&gt;Randy Olsen, actually got an almost favorable review from PZ Myers for his recent book. . .almost&lt;/a&gt;. The third guy in this Axis of Framers is Matthew Nisbit, who I know nothing about other than what I heard from &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/matt_nisbet_framing_science"&gt;his interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast&lt;/a&gt;, where in the same breath he chastized Dawkins for being a bad representative of science and atheism because he’s a big meany while then applauding the fictional Dr. House for being a good representative for science and atheism. Now I have only seen a handful of episodes of &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;, but it seems to me that Dr. House is far more of a meany than Dawkins. But maybe I’m wrong on that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it seems like it’s the “New Atheists” who want people to actually understand science &amp;amp; the accomodationists who want mindless converts who just say they accept science while still holding onto Bronze Age superstitions. Considering how many “New Atheists” were once evangelicals &amp;amp; were mostly convinced otherwise by more aggressive tactics, I’m going to still demand M&amp;amp;K present actual evidence &lt;span&gt;that it’s an ineffective approach. I’d also like to know why misleading people becomes acceptable when one feels it’s persuasive to do so? Seems dishonest to me. Is the Earth 6000-10,000 years old or is the Bible DEAD WRONG? If you answer that the Bible is scientifically wrong on that point, I guess that makes you one of those militant “New Atheist” who can’t let religion and science co-exist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2009/08/10/expelled-from-the-new-york-tim/"&gt;Well now Stein’s bitching about how he did nothing wrong and flinging feces at anything he can think of&lt;/a&gt; (and he says he’s not related to monkeys?). Of course first he tries to blame the persecution he’s endured since his mockumentary, &lt;em&gt;Expelled&lt;/em&gt;, which he claims to have co-wrote in addition to narrating. I find this odd considering that from what I’ve heard from the interviewees on that film, Stein was a late addition to the project who wasn’t even hired yet when the first round of on-camera interviews were conducted. Later, Stein was hired and they re-shot some interviews with Stein sitting across from some of the interviewees  for wide shots and over-the-shoulder shots to give the false impression that Stein was always there and to invent the entirely made-up narrative of the film, which is Ben Stein’s unbiased investigation to find out whether Evolution was legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Stein criticizes the New York Times’ own film critic who like every film critic, panned his film as hard as Roger Ebert panned &lt;em&gt;The Brown Bunny&lt;/em&gt;. Actually, compared to &lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/win_ben_steins_mind.html"&gt;Ebert’s review of &lt;em&gt;Expelled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I think he let Vincent Gallo’s pretentious crap off easy. Stein even laughably inserts an absurd line about a completely different, unnamed critic from The NY Times who many moons ago, he says, panned &lt;em&gt;Ferris Bueller’s Day Off&lt;/em&gt;. Wow! That’s like twenty years ago. The NY Times must really hate Ben Stein. Way to hold onto a grudge there. That must be why they hired him to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabolical!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Stein goes on talking about how his little mockumentary was all about being merely a plea for open discussion, blah, blah, blah. Was that before or after he blamed scientists for the Holocaust, compared scientists to Nazis, and went on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and while promoting the film, stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [i.e. biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed … that was horrifying beyond words, and that’s where science — in my opinion, this is just an opinion — that’s where science leads you.”  -Ben Stein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course it’s partially the atheists fault he violated the terms of his employment with the NY Times. But it’s not just the atheists he blames but also the alleged antagonists he made when he criticized the “investment bank” Goldman Sachs (his use of quotation marks, not mine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he takes another shot at the evil atheists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the haters connected with atheism and neo-Darwinism   continued to attack me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, after you compared them to Nazis–go figure, it’s hard to believe they wouldn’t like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he blames the bad economy and Barack Obama. No, really. He blames Barack Obama for his losing his job because he criticized him in print. I guess we should then expect to see every Republican journalist criticizing Obama to lose their jobs any day now, right Stein? You must be quite the important writer there to have such powerful enemies. Funny how I didn’t even know you were writing for the NY Times until a few weeks ago when I found out that you’d violated the terms of your employment with them. That’s power, baby! Next, I’m sure Osama bin Laden and Kim Jong Il will order their special assassins to take you out by any means necessary. . .cause you’re so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and never mind the fact that the NY Times did apparently let him publish at least one anti-Obama article. Stein just wants to focus on the one article they apparently nixed for. . .well, who cares what the real reason was? I’m sure Stein is 100% accurate in his assessment that it was because of the NY Times’ bias. . .even though, again, they did publish one of his anti-Obama articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabolical fiends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then FINALLY Stein gets to the actual reason he was fired, his advertising for the scammers at FreeScore.com. Of course Stein claims there was no conflict of interest when in fact there was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was no conflict of interest. I had never written   one word in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; or anywhere else about getting   credit scores on line. Not a word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the “Everybody’s Business” columnist, he was working as a financial advice columnist while simultaneously deceiving the public by advertising a product people have to pay $29.95 for when the same  service is available for free by law. Way to protect the public’s wallets during these tough times, Stein. Yup, no conflict of interest there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was not one word of complaint when I did   commercials for immense public companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, because there was no conflict of interest in your promotion of Clear Eyes, which as far as I’m aware, is a legitimate product. Though maybe not. I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By a total coincidence,   I was tossed overboard immediately after my column attacking   Obama. (You can attack Obama from the left at the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; but not from the right.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there goes the Obama blame again. It’s also a funny coincidence how, as you yourself said, they did publish at least one of your anti-Obama articles and a total coincidence that this also happened right after, as you yourself stated four paragraphs earlier, your evil “Darwinist” adversaries informed the NY Times of your conflict of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This commercial was red meat for the Ben Stein haters left over   from the &lt;em&gt;Expelled&lt;/em&gt; days. They bombarded the   &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; with letters. They confused (or some of them   seemingly confused ) FreeScore with other companies that did not   have FreeScore’s unblemished record with consumer protection   agencies. (FreeScore has a perfect record.) They demanded of the   high pooh-bahs at the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that they fire me because of   what they called a conflict of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which is it, Stein? Is it not a coincidence because you just wrote a piece criticizing the president or was it not a coincidence because your intellectual superiors in the science world exposed your hypocrasy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, I really mean this, I will pray for   those who use me despitefully, even if the neo-Darwinists think   that’s a waste of time. It’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe instead you should pray for the NY Times to give you your job back and see how effective prayer really is, huh? That truly would be compelling evidence that prayer really worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know, I guess Stein’s not all bad though. It’s not like he compared his persecution to that of the greatest songwriter of all time, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole subject reminds me of a conversation Bob Dylan had long   ago with a reporter who asked him what he thought about how much   criticism he was getting for going from acoustic to electric   guitar. “There are a lot of people who have knives and forks,” he   said, “and they have nothing on their plates, so they have to cut   something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of a bitch!&lt;/p&gt;

You can &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_creation_museum_1.php"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-1.html"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the science, I managed to come away from the weekend learning quite a bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cats that give me allergies are evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have been focused too long on atheist &lt;em&gt;license plates&lt;/em&gt; as a way to display your beliefs.  I completely ignored the possibility of promoting your beliefs on the backs of trucks!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0313.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0313.jpg" alt="IMG_0313" title="IMG_0313" width="400" height="608"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indiana is scary.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always knew PZ bore a resemblance… :
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0314.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0314.jpg" alt="IMG_0314" title="IMG_0314" width="400" height="439"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Creation Museum has a presentation called “Men in White”:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0315.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0315.jpg" alt="IMG_0315" title="IMG_0315" width="400" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend offered this explanation: “If you learn any real science during your museum tour, they zap you at the end and make you forget it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve never enjoyed Twitter as much as I did while going through the museum.  Granted there was little wi-fi access inside the museum, it was easy to catch up on what was happening, live, while reading the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23creozerg"&gt;#creozerg feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best part about the museum: The gift shop.  It’s a storehouse of humor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books in the museum gift shop are incredibly un-politically-correct.  I don’t know what this subtitle means, but I don’t think it’s a Poe:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0318.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0318.jpg" alt="IMG_0318" title="IMG_0318" width="400" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’s some wacky Biblical explanation behind this… but are the fundamentalist Christians &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to make people dislike them?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing about &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0890511675?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0890511675"&gt;Life in the Great Ice Age&lt;/a&gt;, a book cover with lots of green grass doesn’t convince me of its accuracy:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0319.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_0319.jpg" alt="IMG_0319" title="IMG_0319" width="400" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of rainstorms?  According to this Creation Museum book, reason #1 is that God wants to punish people:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_03201.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_03201.jpg" alt="IMG_03201" title="IMG_03201" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other best part about the museum: The clothing worn by our group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check this out:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00008.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00008.JPG" alt="DSC00008" title="DSC00008" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alli&lt;/strong&gt;’s shirt reads “Science is Awesome!!!”  Her left sleeve indicates where she bought it from: the Creation Museum, during a previous visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  How’s that for irony?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alli said the shirt was no longer being sold during this more recent visit… maybe the staff realized that science doesn’t help their cause.  Or maybe they just ran out of the shirts because the atheists bought them all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can be told to &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=8280168&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;turn your shirt inside-out&lt;/a&gt; when it reads “There’s probably no god, so stop worrying and enjoy your life”… but &lt;strong&gt;Jason&lt;/strong&gt;’s shirt went surprisingly unnoticed:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00012.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00012.JPG" alt="DSC00012" title="DSC00012" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/strong&gt; would have been appalled by this joke of a “science museum”:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00013.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00013.JPG" alt="DSC00013" title="DSC00013" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know you’re a math nerd when you see &lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt;’s shirt as I did, solve it, and then giggle in amusement while others stare blankly:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00036.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00036.JPG" alt="DSC00036" title="DSC00036" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When several dozen atheists march outside the museum &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/11/pz-myers-becomes-a-kentucky-colonel/"&gt;to see a special ceremony&lt;/a&gt; just beyond the entrance gates, it totally freaks out the Creation Museum security guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve been asked: What do we gain from visiting the museum when much of its content is already online?  Why give money to the museum?   Several things.
&lt;p&gt;300 atheists can go back home with a first-hand description of what the museum is like and how many lies are contained inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are motivated to educate others about rational thought and the scientific method — a motivation you probably can’t get when you just read about this museum from afar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a plethora of blog postings, Twitter messages, and media mentions about how atheists went to this museum.  Those messages contain examples of the absurd theories this museum says are accurate.  The reach we have is really immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our admission costs were (unfortunately) a drop in the bucket for the museum.  Even on the day we went, we were only &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2009/08/08/the-day-285-atheistsagnostics-visited-the-creation-museum/"&gt;12% of the daily attendance&lt;/a&gt;.  To give them some money in exchange for exposing their lies and motivating atheists to fight against unscientific ideas is well worth it, I think.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; decided to forego several hour-long talks and instead have shorter 20-minute talks at the conference (with a couple exceptions).  This was an awesome idea.  We’re *totally* doing this again in the future.  It’s much better than my experience at other conferences, when in some cases, I realized 10 minutes into a talk that the boring speaker had another 30 or 40 minutes to go… thankfully, the SSA had great speakers and the sessions flew by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atheists often talk about gaps at meetings, like the Gender gap (lots of men, few women) and the Age gap (lots of old people, few students).  But we rarely talk about the Race gap.  There was only one black person attending the conference (one other spoke) and very few Asians.  We need to find a way to fix this problem and get more minorities involved in our movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s probably not a good idea to schedule a talk on “How to get people to attend your meetings” at 9:00 a.m. on a Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/strong&gt; has a very strong sense of awareness about how influential he is, what he means to other atheists (especially younger ones), and how to connect with his audience.  Despite his “bad guy” reputation online, he is incredibly nice in person.  The disconnect between those two personas may be larger than anyone else’s I can think of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PZ reads every single one of the comments on his blog.  I’m amazed (though not very surprised) by that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PZ’s philosophy in a nutshell:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00056.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DSC00056.JPG" alt="DSC00056" title="DSC00056" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t take “mockery” the wrong way.  The idea is that if you can convince people that religious beliefs (e.g. a cracker being the actual body of Christ, the Earth being only 6,000 years old, etc.) are ridiculous, we’ll be able to be more effective at getting people to think rationally.  Debating and calling the other side nasty names aren’t as powerful.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;a href="http://secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt;’s Executive Director &lt;strong&gt;Sean Faircloth&lt;/strong&gt; stays in his position for a long time, his greatest gift to our movement could be influencing one of our own to run for Congress.  The students had wonderful things to say about him after he spoke and I wouldn’t be surprised if others eventually decide to follow in his footsteps and run for public office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (of which I chair the board of directors) ran a very efficient conference, all thanks to our two staff members, two interns, and a few volunteers.  I think we put on a really excellent conference (but I’m biased).  You can tell me if I’m wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One down side to the SSA’s work is that it’s very hard to raise money for our organization when the people we serve (students) are the least able to give us donations.  Look at this chart:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Opportunity.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Opportunity.JPG" alt="Opportunity" title="Opportunity" width="292" height="322"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how big we’re becoming.  I don’t know how many groups we’ll end up having in 2010.  It’s amazing and scary all at once.  Scary because we may not be able to support all these groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the SSA’s cash flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Obstacle.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Obstacle.JPG" alt="Obstacle" title="Obstacle" width="302" height="324"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may look like a lot of money, but that money pays for two full-time staffers, interns, an office, travel grants to students, project grants to our groups, speakers’ travel fees, etc.  At the rate of growth we have, we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; at least one other campus organizer on the payroll.  At the very least, we need to keep our current staff and pay them what they’re worth (we don’t do them justice).  &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/node/8"&gt;We need your help&lt;/a&gt; to be able to provide services like this conference and campus group support.  Please consider making a contribution if you have the means..
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Its Vocational Independence Program looks to “maximize the potential of individuals with learning differences by teaching skills and strategies and providing support necessary for successful and independent lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:600px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/enhance.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/enhance-590x136.jpg" alt="Image: NYIT VIP" width="590" height="136"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: NYIT VIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During freshman year, students “adjust to the collegiate experience” with such courses as college study skills and managing a personal budget, and take field trips to Long Island and New York City. They also team up to tackle large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The junior year curriculum focuses on living independently: food and nutrition, budgeting, apartment living. Junior dormitory living spaces more closely model living independently in an apartment with roommates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a heck of an idea — I hope Alex can hook up with something like this someday — so soon I’ll be asking a couple of questions of the director of the program, and will run the answers here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eunice Shriver, sister of JFK and mother of California First Lady Maria Shriver, died this morning, and everyone who cares about someone with autism lost a real achiever and a bulldog advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with just a summer camp on her Maryland family farm, she founded Special Olympics in 1968 back in what many parents still remember as the darkest ages of recognition and treatment for all types of disabilities and challenges. She was tireless for the rights of the challenged and the disabled; the Kennedy brothers used to joke in the White House about getting her off their phone so they could get back to running the government.&lt;/p&gt;

It was liberally sprinkled with the chiropractor's name, address, and phone number, and included such gems as "Chiropractic Prevents Other Conditions" (high blood pressure, colic, ear infections, and Parkinson's diseases), "Chiropractic Boosts Immunity", and "Chiropractic May Make You Smarter" by improved cortical processing,  as measured by testing volunteers' response time to various stimulations   The chiropractor flyer states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Many people find that they actually save money on their health care expenses by seeing a chiropractor. Another way to save. Studies show that chiropractic can double your immune capacity, naturally and without drugs. The immune system fights colds, the flu, and other sicknesses. So you may not be running off to the doctor as much.</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Naomi Baker)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250056264097"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/i_am_a_scientist_video.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e070690fa30decba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Fun"/><title type="html">I Am A Scientist (video)</title><published>2009-08-12T04:26:15Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T04:26:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/fVqASIuV1Sc/i_am_a_scientist_video.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/i_am_a_scientist_video.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Sexual selection is not the freshest of news. Darwin&amp;#39;s grandfather Erasmus had already commented on it. [1]

But a very pertinent question is why it occurs, or at least, what is selected. After all, why does a female finds a male sexy?Two hypotheses could explain that. Fisher proposed the sexy gene hypothesis. He argues that, whatever the characteristic chosen by females, if it comes from a gene, that gene must become common within a population just because it has been picked up. A female that chooses a male with the sexy gene will have offsprings with that very gene, which in turn will be chosen by other females, spreading it. The other hypothesis is the good genes one. According to it, when females prefer a certain trace, they are actually opting for a male&amp;#39;s good health, reflected on that given trace. For instance, a male with bright red feathers that uses carotene to increase the redness. Only a very healthy male has enough carotene to &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; on plumage, so whoever gets the redder male will have healthier offspring and will have been favored by sexual selection.Whatever the reason, good genes or sexy genes, the selected characteristics in the Birds of Paradise make them amazing. Scenes from BBC&amp;#39;s Planet Earth.Both hypotheses seem to be correct. It all depends on the cost involved in the choice. When its not too cost-intensive for the females to choose (e.g. birds that gather for &amp;quot;exhibition parades&amp;quot; with heaps of males, sexy gene might prevail, like in peacock&amp;#39;s tails). In other scenarios, where choice uses resoures, be it looking around for males or exposing their presence to predators for the exhibition, the selected characteristic must have added value, a good gene. But neither hypothesis explain how a characteristic begins to be selected. Why do females prefer a certain color, a song or any other thing? Where does the preference come from? 

Look at the Physalaemus pustulosus frog for instance: males have a longer call (sounding a bit like &amp;quot;wiiiinnnnn&amp;quot;) followed by a screech at the end. Kinda hard to put in words. Check out this video and enjoy the singing:

Like with most frogs, the song is used to attract partners. But in closer-related species, males don&amp;#39;t do the second part, they only chant the &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; bit. Now a bizarre fact. When the P. pustulosus melody was played through loudspeakers to females of other close-related species, they like it better than their own species&amp;#39; call! They prefered the screeching end, albeit they had never heard it before, since their own kind does not do it. Therefore, they already have the nervous circuit that make them like that kind of song better, but only the P. pustulosus males use them. There is a bias preference amongst the females, who hear and prefer that frequency, but males of the other more than 40 species of the same genus can&amp;#39;t use it. [2]

Platy (left) and Green Swordtail (right). Same genus, but only one has a sword-shaped tail.Other species follow the same path. In Xiphophorus fish, only the swordfish has its anal fin elongated. The longer the tail, more successful the owner. In close-related species, like platy, on which that long fin inexists, the same bias repeats itself. If artificial tails are attached to the males, thay become more popular. Again, females still prefer something they have never seen before. Probably because they prefer bigger males.In more and more species, from birds with more intricate melodies to mite with specialized appendages on their pedipalps, we find characteristics in one species that are not present in others of the same genus, but are quite successful among them. It is about those who manage to explore a tendency already present.  The implication is that preference for a trait is inherent to females according to the more utilized senses. It could be the &amp;quot;eyes&amp;quot; on the pattern of a peacock&amp;#39;s tail, since they are vision-oriented birds and need to be in constant lookout for predators. And that crest is sure to attract attention. Senses and nervous circuits that are already in constant use for, say, searching food - like a spider&amp;#39;s sense of touch - are co-utilized or re-routed for sexual function. Which is expected, for our senses resources are limited. [3]Nothing more fitting for evolution. Females preference is already there and males born with tiny variations. The one with a novelty-colored fin or a more refined song will be chosen and have more descendents rather than their rivals without those characteristics. With time, that gene becomes so ordinary as to level the success rate of all males, until one displays another interesting change, and the cycle starts over.After all, the ladies like surprises.Sources:[1] Smith, C.

I've &lt;a href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2006/11/oooohh-atheists-are-bad-guys-after-all_21.html"&gt;addressed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2007/10/dsouzaagain.html"&gt;D'Souza&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2008/04/dinesh-douchesouza-gets-it-wrong-once.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, but here he poses a question that I've heard from several people in both verbal exchanges and in essays so I wanted to address it.  D'Souza states the position in part 11 of 13, starting about 2:10 into it saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In every culture, when you ask someone, 'where did you learn about right and wrong?', he says, 'I'm a Muslim, I'm a Hindu'...now, true we can probably do it by philosophy, but I've yet to meet a guy who says, 'I got my morality from Hegel.'  So we can talk all we want about philosophy, but the truth of it is that religion has delivered the goods as being the transmission belt of conveying morality.  What about hope and life and a sense of purpose?....Religion, by giving a sense of purpose and meaning to life, by ultimately answering the large questions that science has proved radically incapable of even entertaining, (is better than secular science)..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;To start, he is using a logical fallacy known as &lt;i&gt;making shit up out of completely thin air&lt;/i&gt;.  Really?  Religion has "delivered the goods"?  Religion has "ultimately answered the large questions" that science hasn't?  I'm going to have to call shenanigans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religion does not answer questions.  Let's just say that out loud, shall we?  Religion is, at best, a place holder until a better answer comes along that has, you know, a foothold in reality.  Science doesn't have to answer everything - the big questions included - because it has people who are always working on answers.  The answers are rarely complete and are always up for revision, which is why there are changes and updates and progress.  Religion is still WAAAAAYYYYY back in the Dark Ages thinking that men in the sky dole out parcels of wisdom and senses of purpose one rainbow at a time.  For fuck's sake, how do grown humans buy into this stupid shit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religion puts a nonsensical bubble in the spot where an answer should go, but by doing so, they don't accomplish anything other than stopping potentially smart people from looking at the problem in the future.  There are smart people in religions, but when they look at certain questions and see that "God did this in that way for that purpose over there; so says Rev. So-And-So", they tend to move on to other problems.  It's ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To answer questions or solve a problem, you have to provide solutions that (a) explain the observable details and (b) do not raise more questions that are unanswerable.  Occam's handy razor should always be in your pocket so that when D'Souza says something like, "Religion...by ultimately answering the large questions that science has proved radically incapable of even entertaining (is better than secular science)", you can point out that not knowing the answer and being ok with that bit of ignorance for the time being is better than saying a "man in the sky dictated a book to a bunch of men and it tells us how to be good people, and terrible misogynistic war-ridden people...but ignore that last part."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Questions?&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

&lt;p&gt;A number of us had an exciting weekend. The &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/" rel="external "&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had their national conference this past Friday through Sunday, in Columbus, Ohio…a quick two hour drive from the infamous Creation “Museum” in Kentucky. So a field trip was hastily organized, which quickly grew and grew, until over 300 of us gathered before the doors of Ken Ham’s very silly establishment and spent an afternoon prowling through the absurdities. We now have a fine collection of articles for you to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together a long &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_creation_museum_1.php" rel="external "&gt;summary of my impressions of the “museum”&lt;/a&gt;. My impression is that I was greatly unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t alone, obviously—so I’ve also assembled a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/tales_of_the_300_more_accounts.php" rel="external "&gt;collection of links to blog posts, Flickr photo sets, and YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;. It was a very productive weekend that generated a huge volume of critical articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a very nice &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_whole_experience.php" rel="external "&gt;video of one group’s experience going through the place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We managed to rouse the ire of Ken Ham, who wrote a few complaints and attempted defenses of his goofball palaces. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/aig_is_angry_with_us_for_repor.php" rel="external "&gt;Both&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_think_we_successfully_poked.php" rel="external "&gt;complaints&lt;/a&gt; have been shot down — with the evidence we gathered on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the real triumph of the whole big shindig was that I got to ride the triceratops with a saddle!&lt;/p&gt;

Larkum, Thomas Nevian, Maya Sandler, Alon Polsky, and Jackie Schiller), unfortunately behind a paywall.   What this paper does is demonstrate that a type of neural activity called an NMDA spike (see below), already known to occur in the basal branches of the dendrites of pyramidal cells, also occur in the branches in the apical tuft, the arborization that occurs at the top of the apical dendrite, the main dendrite that reaches from the soma (body) up to the top layer (Layer I) where the majority of synaptic connections are made between incoming axons (from other brain regions) and pyramidal cells (which produce outgoing axons to other brain regions).[1]  As of late 2007, &amp;quot;NMDA spikes have been observed in basal dendrites but not apical dendrites&amp;quot;,[4] but now:  We report the existence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spikes in the fine distal tuft dendrites that otherwise did not support the initiation of calcium spikes.&amp;amp;nbsp Both direct measurements and computer simulations showed that NMDA spikes are the dominant mechanism by which distal synaptic input leads to firing of the neuron and provide the substrate for complex parallel processing of top-down input arriving at the tuft.[1] Before we look at what these NMDA spikes are, let&amp;#39;s look briefly at the implications of this discovery:Integrative Calculations in Pyramidal NeuronsFigure 1:  Structures of selected pyramidal neurons from different cortical areas.&amp;amp;nbsp  Click on image to see full image and original caption.&amp;amp;nbsp  (From Reference 4, figure 1..)Figure 2:  Simplified (!) diagram of the calculating modules according to the &amp;quot;New Unifying Principle&amp;quot; in Reference 1.  Each box represents an integrative calculating unit, capable of performing a large variety of calculations with its inputs.  The circles represent input information coming via synapses.   Note that the logical organization here doesn&amp;#39;t map exactly to the physical organization of the neuron:   the non-linear voltage responses of the synapses, the locations of the synapses on the local branches, and the non-linear voltage responses of the dendritic membrane of the local branches should all be considered part of the calculation box.   The input, then, consists of the flow of neurotransmitters across the synapse.  The timing of the arrival of the action potential, and any calculations that take place in the pre-synaptic neuron, aren&amp;#39;t included in this diagram.  Click on image to see larger version.  (Original.   You may link to, copy, and/or modify this image, as long as you give credit with a link to this post.)Looking at Figure 2, we can see that there are a number of modules, potentially nested, which perform semi-independent calculations.&amp;amp;nbsp  They feed their results to modules progressively closer (and ultimately identical) to the soma, which (along with the axon hillock and the first 50-100 microns of the axon) performs the final calculation regarding whether, and when, to fire an action potential.&amp;amp;nbsp  Prior to this research, the modules in the apical tuft (those feeding the proximate apical dendrite, see also figure 1) were regarded as different in kind from those in the basal branches.[4]  What this research has (tentatively) demonstrated is that the integrating modules called &amp;quot;Fine Dendrite Branches&amp;quot; in Figure 2 appear to act in very similar fashions, although they provide their outputs to different places.[1]  The outputs of from the tuft branches feed the integrating/calculating module represented by the proximate apical dendrite, which performs a calculation that involves a process called a &amp;quot;calcium spike&amp;quot; (see below), which had been thought to be caused in the tuft branches,[4] but with this research are (tentatively) shown not to be caused in the branches, but only in the proximate apical dendrite.[1]  This permits the &amp;quot;New Unifying Principle&amp;quot;:  The thin distal tuft and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which receive the overwhelming majority of synaptic inputs ([ref]), appear to constitute a class of dendrite in which NMDA spikes are the predominant regenerative events summing synaptic inputs in semi-independent compartments.&amp;amp;nbsp The output of each subunit in this class of dendrite is passed on to the major sites of integration at the axon and apical calcium initiation zones, which can all interact via actively propagated signals ([ref]), enabling the interactions between top-down and bottom-up information.[1] This represents a major change to how pyramidal cells should be viewed, offering different pictures of their modular breakdown and evolution. ...  We can reasonably suppose that the evolution of the neocortex involved, among other things, some improvements and refinements to the integrating calculation process of the apical calcium initiation zones in the proximate apical dendrite.&amp;amp;nbsp  Pyramidal neurons &amp;quot;are abundant in the cerebral cortex of virtually every mammal that has ever been studied, as well as in those of birds, fish and reptiles, but not amphibians.&amp;quot;[4]  They are:  found in most mammalian forebrain structures, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the amygdala, but not the olfactory bulb, the striatum, the midbrain, the hindbrain or the spinal cord.&amp;amp;nbsp Thus, they are found primarily in structures that are associated with advanced cognitive functions[.][4]  We can reasonably suppose that the original version, developed either by early amniotes (and independently by fish), or much earlier in vertebrate evolution (and lost by ancestral amphibians), was only capable of supporting the three-layer cortical structure of reptiles and the allocortex of mammals. Currents, Spikes, and Action PotentialsThe functioning of a neuron is very complex, with a very large number of interacting &amp;quot;moving parts&amp;quot;.&amp;amp;nbsp  Any effort to simplify the picture to the point that it can be discussed in a blog post will inevitably lose critical details, as well as producing a picture that fails to apply to most types of these cells.&amp;amp;nbsp  Nevertheless, we can look at a few general processes that are common to most (if not all) neurons.The first thing we need to consider is the cell membrane, and various differences between the inside and outside.&amp;amp;nbsp  The two critical differences for our purposes are the voltage across the membrane, and the different concentrations of certain critical ions:  sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca+2), potassium (K+), and chloride (Cl-).&amp;amp;nbsp  Both the concentration differences and the voltage tend to drive a movement of ions across the membrane, however they can&amp;#39;t get through the membrane proper without the help of ion channels, of which every type of neuron is provided with a large number of many types.&amp;amp;nbsp  In a typical resting state, Na+ is being &amp;quot;pulled&amp;quot; into the cell by both concentration difference and voltage, while K+ is closer to equilibrium, with a smaller &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; outwards because the resting voltage across the membrane isn&amp;#39;t quite enough to balance the difference in concentrations.&amp;amp;nbsp  Ca+2 is being &amp;quot;pulled&amp;quot; inwards even harder than Na+, while Cl- is a special case, in some neuron membranes at rest seeing a slight &amp;quot;pull&amp;quot; inwards, while in others there&amp;#39;s a slight &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; outwards....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

But with a lot more psychophysical and brain mapping data coming in from studies being done on normal subjects and people with brain disorders, the field has opened up. In the last decade, a variety of brain processes were proposed to account for consciousness and several more keep coming in but as of today, no concrete model exists. Typical examples include recurrent computation (Grossberg (1999) and Lamme (2006)), synchronized neural activity (Bachmann (1994), Engel et. al (1999)), winner takes all computation (Grossberg (1999)), closed loop action-perception processing (O'Regan and Noe (2001)). In the midst of the madness, comes a paper by Herzog et. al titled Consciousness and the Small Network Argument (Herzog, Esfeld and Gerstner (2007)). They propose that none of the current models can fully account for consciousness because of what they call the small network argument:For each of the above models, there exists a very small neural network that fulfills the respective characteristics of the model but does not exhibit consciousness1) Recurrent Computation (Lamme (2006))Two mutually connected neurons make up a recurrent systems. Thus if recurrence is sufficient for consciousness, a network of two neurons must create consciousness (to which not may of us may accede).2) Winner Takes All Computation (Grossberg (1999))The basic operation of a winner-takes-all (WTA) circuit is to suppress the activity of all neurons except the one having the largest input. Minimal models require only three neurons fully connected to three presynaptic neurons, plus a neuron for vigilance, taking the tally to seven. Such a network can develop states allowing learning and memory. And so are we willing to grant consciousness to a network of seven neurons?3) Synchronized Neural Activity (Bachmann (1994), Engel et. al (1999))If synchronized firing in neurons is the main characteristic of consciousness, then a group of three inter connected neurons firing in synchrony is conscious4) Closed-loop action perception processing (O'Regan and Noe (2001))Herzog et. al give the example of a thermostat with a temperature sensor ('perception') controlling a heater ('action'). This could be formulated as a two neuron feed-forward network with a sensory neuron connected to an output neuron controlling the switch.Thus they argue that if one does not want to attribute consciousness to such small networks, other components are needed. Additional characteristics are often imposed. Typical examples being attention, number of neurons and complexity of the network. Yet, none of these additional components necessarily solves the small network argument.1) O'Regan and Noe (2001) combined their sensorimotor contingency approach with attention based processing. They state that perception occurs in a closed loop of action and information processing but consciousness emerges only when attention comes into play. The most common example of this being a person driving a car in an unconscious and automatic mode (unconsciously perceiving other cars on the road and taking correct measures), but conscious perception, e.g. of a traffic signal, arises only when attention comes into play. However, in this model, attention can be incorporated with just one single extra input arising from a second group containing a very small number of cells...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

A precocious little girl of 5 or thereabouts approached the couple, she was infatuated with the baby. The fountain was hardly the Trevi Fountain (No, the photo below isn’t the Venetian in Vegas), but soon the fellow gave the little girl a nickel and instructed her to toss it into the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="Trevi Fountain" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/trevi_fountain-300x224.jpg" alt="Trevi Fountain" width="300" height="224"&gt;“Close your eyes first. Really tightly. Make a wish!  Remember, if you don’t close your eyes tightly and keep the wish to yourself, IT WON’T COME TRUE!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He repeated these instructions insistently as the girl scrunched her eyes, her fists clenched. Then she threw the coin into the fountain and opened her eyes, frowning from the concentration involved. She really believed…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why, but her earnest expression and determination touched me.  Maybe I thought it wasn’t this stranger’s place to plant a seed of superstitious stupidity into the kid’s head. Maybe I recalled an image of my mother telling me to pick up the silverware she dropped in the restaurant she worked in, because this was “good luck”. Maybe I thought of the hours I would spend in the garden, searching for a four-leaf clover after my father told me it was “good luck”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents told me some silly whoppers – ghosts really exist, and Lucky my pet guinea pig was “living in the shed” for some two years…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do skeptics tell their children these sorts of things? Do skeptics tell their kids about Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny? Where does this lie on the continuum of fairy tale to bullshit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps telling these stories is merely perpetuating a cute custom, or is it laying the foundation for future magical thinking? Many of the wrong and stupid things we’re ‘taught’ end up slithering into that fuzzy, hard to re-wire thing called our socialization. Then it becomes ‘normal’, or even ‘knowledge’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re religious, at what point have we moved from sharing a parable to telling lies for god? If we retell fables, at what stage do we go from keeping folklore alive to telling lies about the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are they not lies but ignorance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with folklore is a complex issue, some might say problem, for anthropologists, and especially cultural anthropologists. We have an emphasis on describing behavior, not prescribing it. It’s all good and well to watch the ceremonies and rituals, but at what point do you say that the sick man would be better off in the capital city’s hospital than being lashed with tree branches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point do you observe and preserve the tradition, and at what point do you start saying, “That wasn’t a “witch” you just tied to a post and burned to death. That was a woman; someone’s wife,  mother, sister and daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we all have our own opinions on these matters, and indeed, it should be left to the discretion of parents to shape the beliefs of their kids, and more importantly, encourage the development of the individual’s critical thinking skills. Hopefully this education isn’t influenced by strangers, or at least stupid strangers. Hopefully this education isn’t influenced by stupid parents either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d be pissed off if the above turd ‘taught’ this old wives’ tale to my child. But if you caught him out, it could be an opportunity to teach some reason and rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever we think, it’s hard to look beyond our own culture and time…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Karen Stollznow</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250041126593"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14944">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/161d1e414257c15f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Which Side is Susan Hutchison on?</title><published>2009-08-12T01:00:45Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T01:00:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/11/which-side-is-susan-hutchison-on/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan Hutchison&lt;/strong&gt; is a former news anchor at KIRO-TV in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009620447_hutchisonrecords07m.html"&gt;some drama &lt;/a&gt;in her life, but what’s relevant here is that she’s running for King County executive (similar to a mayor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mountain Humanist&lt;/strong&gt; noticed &lt;a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kplu/news.newsmain/article/1/0/1539158/KPLU.Local.News/King.County.Executive%27s.Race.Susan.Hutchison"&gt;something odd in her bio&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since leaving KIRO Hutchison has been very, very busy. She has her own consulting business. She is the executive director for the Charles Simonyi Fund for the arts and sciences which among other things, supports the work of atheist Richard Dawkins. She’s also served on the board of the Discovery Institute, which promotes the idea of intelligent design…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Hutchison directs the program that funds &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;‘ former post at the University of Oxford… and she supports the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, which actively tries to discredit the science that Dawkins spends his life advocating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s like being on the boards of both Planned Parenthood and Focus on the Family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;, which is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_%28magazine%29" rel="external "&gt;the most widely read magazine in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, had run an article called, &lt;a href="http://www.parade.com/news/intelligence-report/archive/who-should-help-struggling-churches.html" rel="external "&gt;“Who should help struggling churches?”&lt;/a&gt; According to the article, contributions to churches are down at a time when demands for assistance are rising. $100 million of economic-recovery funding will go to emergency programs, some of which are run directly by religious institutions, and other emergency funds will go to churches as well.  Catholic Charities says, “The need for assistance is staggering,” and I have no doubt it is, but Americans United for the Separation of Church and State expressed concern that funding is being given to religious organizations with no safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt; is distributed by more than 400 newspapers across the United States. The magazine polled its readers, asking the question, “Should churches receive government funding without restrictions?”  The question is obviously a bit of a &lt;em&gt;non sequitur&lt;/em&gt;, since the funding in question would be restricted to emergency food and shelter programs, among others. (Yes, money is fungible, but let’s not get into that right now.) The poll is also not particularly scientific, because no pains were taken to get a representative sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, at press time for the August 9 issue, 81 % voted “No,” and 19 % voted “Yes.” The poll is still open, and when I checked today the result was 86 % to 14 %.  There is no indication how many people responded to the poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The August 9 issue featured 2 comments.  Under “Yes,” a reader wrote, “Churches don’t discriminate when deciding who[m] to help.… put money in the hands of those who are doing good.” Under “No,” another reader wrote that government funding “goes against our founding principle of the separation of church and state. [Churches] are already tax exempt; that’s enough.” I did not read the on-line comments very carefully, but these seem more or less representative. Some commenters warned against the government’s placing restrictions on religious organizations, and several claimed that the seperation [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] of church and state is not in the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have cast my vote, but good form prohibits me from revealing how I voted.&lt;/p&gt;

And if you have, drive to the nearest coffee shop you've not been to lately and vote for her there!!!!!!!  She's gaining momentum.  Let's do this thing! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary that you &lt;a href="http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/photos/view/3339/sort:Photo.created"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt; and vote for Ana by giving her &lt;strong&gt;Five&lt;/strong&gt; Stars (below the photo).  Please do this right now, and again tomorrow.  Don't vote for any of the other contestants.

&lt;p&gt;I've known Ana for nearly as long as I've lived in Minnesota, and I can vouch for her many talents. She is an accomplished stage and movie actress and model.  She is also an excellent photographer, quite a good singer, and a diligent political activist, fine artist, and dog lover.  

&lt;p&gt;Ana took a large role in documenting the police actions at the Democratic National Convention one year ago, and more recently, donated hundreds of hours of her time working with a non-profit overseeing the Franken Senate Race recount.  She is one of the Quiche Moraine team as well.  I count Ana as one of my best friends evah.  Tomorrow, I'll be driving around town from coffee shop to coffee shop ... well, checking my email and stuff. If you catch my drift.  

&lt;p&gt;Ana is currently in the top ten females in the contest, and if she remains there she'll have a chance. &lt;a href="http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/photos/view/3339/sort:Photo.created"&gt;Please vote now, every vote counts&lt;/a&gt;.  If you don't vote for Ana, don't come back here because you are not my friend, OK????   &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/lets_do_this_thing_only_a_coup.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/LkJRdHeq500" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250038533544"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8782">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9070b1424c046d4c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Psychics"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="YouTube"/><category term="psych"/><title type="html">Psych Season Four!</title><published>2009-08-12T00:18:45Z</published><updated>2009-08-12T00:18:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8782" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for something to watch tonight?

&lt;p&gt;The 9-year-old boy claims to have discovered a spearhead that is 6,000 year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s unpossible.  The world was just created then.  No one would’ve been around to create the spearhead, and the “European explorers” the piece refers to would not have existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006614" title=""&gt;The Apollo Number: Space Suits, Self-Support, and the Walk-Run Transition&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How space suits affect the preferred walk-run transition is an open question with relevance to human biomechanics and planetary extravehicular activity. Walking and running energetics differ; in reduced gravity (&amp;lt;0.5 g), running, unlike on Earth, uses less energy per distance than walking. The walk-run transition (denoted *) correlates with the Froude Number (Fr = v2/gL, velocity v, gravitational acceleration g, leg length L). Human unsuited Fr* is relatively constant (~0.5) with gravity but increases substantially with decreasing gravity below ~0.4 g, rising to 0.9 in 1/6 g; space suits appear to lower Fr*. Because of pressure forces, space suits partially (1 g) or completely (lunar-g) support their own weight. We define the Apollo Number (Ap = Fr/M) as an expected invariant of locomotion under manipulations of M, the ratio of human-supported to total transported mass. We hypothesize that for lunar suited conditions Ap* but not Fr* will be near 0.9, because the Apollo Number captures the effect of space suit self-support. We used the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal and other sources to identify 38 gait events during lunar exploration for which we could determine gait type (walk/lope/run) and calculate Ap. We estimated the binary transition between walk/lope (0) and run (1), yielding Fr* (0.36±0.11, mean±95% CI) and Ap* (0.68±0.20). The Apollo Number explains 60% of the difference between suited and unsuited Fr*, appears to capture in large part the effects of space suits on the walk-run transition, and provides several testable predictions for space suit locomotion and, of increasing relevance here on Earth, exoskeleton locomotion. The knowledge of how space suits affect gait transitions can be used to optimize space suits for use on the Moon and Mars.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006573" title=""&gt;Ants, Cataglyphis cursor, Use Precisely Directed Rescue Behavior to Free Entrapped Relatives&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although helping behavior is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom, actual rescue activity is particularly rare. Nonetheless, here we report the first experimental evidence that ants, Cataglyphis cursor, use precisely directed rescue behavior to free entrapped victims; equally important, they carefully discriminate between individuals in distress, offering aid only to nestmates. Our experiments simulate a natural situation, which we often observed in the field when collecting Catagyphis ants, causing sand to collapse in the process. Using a novel experimental technique that binds victims experimentally, we observed the behavior of separate, randomly chosen groups of 5 C. cursor nestmates under one of six conditions. In five of these conditions, a test stimulus (the "victim") was ensnared with nylon thread and held partially beneath the sand. The test stimulus was either (1) an individual from the same colony; (2) an individual from a different colony of C cursor; (3) an ant from a different ant species; (4) a common prey item; or, (5) a motionless (chilled) nestmate. In the final condition, the test stimulus (6) consisted of the empty snare apparatus. Our results demonstrate that ants are able to recognize what, exactly, holds their relative in place and direct their behavior to that object, the snare, in particular. They begin by excavating sand, which exposes the nylon snare, transporting sand away from it, and then biting at the snare itself. Snare biting, a behavior never before reported in the literature, demonstrates that rescue behavior is far more sophisticated, exact and complexly organized than the simple forms of helping behavior already known, namely limb pulling and sand digging. That is, limb pulling and sand digging could be released directly by a chemical call for help and thus result from a very simple mechanism. However, it's difficult to see how this same releasing mechanism could guide rescuers to the precise location of the nylon thread, and enable them to target their bites to the thread itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006550" title=""&gt;Illusionary Self-Motion Perception in Zebrafish&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zebrafish mutant belladonna (bel) carries a mutation in the lhx2 gene (encoding a Lim domain homeobox transcription factor) that results in a defect in retinotectal axon pathfinding, which can lead to uncrossed optic nerves failing to form an optic chiasm. Here, we report on a novel swimming behavior of the bel mutants, best described as looping. Together with two previously reported oculomotor instabilities that have been related to achiasmatic bel mutants, reversed optokinetic response (OKR) and congenital nystagmus (CN, involuntary conjugate oscillations of both eyes), looping opens a door to study the influence of visual input and eye movements on postural balance. Our result shows that looping correlates perfectly with reversed OKR and CN and is vision-dependent and contrast sensitive. CN precedes looping and the direction of the CN slow phase is predictive of the looping direction, but is absent during looping. Therefore, looping may be triggered by CN in bel. Moreover, looping in wild-type fish can also be evoked by whole-field motion, suggesting that looping in a bel mutant larvae is a result of self-motion perception. In contrary to previous hypotheses, our findings indicate that postural control in vertebrates relies on both direct visual input (afference signal) and eye-movement-related signals (efference copy or reafference signal).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006581" title=""&gt;Neural Correlates of Appetite and Hunger-Related Evaluative Judgments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How much we desire a meal depends on both the constituent foods and how hungry we are, though not every meal becomes more desirable with increasing hunger. The brain therefore needs to be able to integrate hunger and meal properties to compute the correct incentive value of a meal. The present study investigated the functional role of the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex in mediating hunger and dish attractiveness. Furthermore, it explored neural responses to dish descriptions particularly susceptible to value-increase following fasting. We instructed participants to rate how much they wanted food menu items while they were either hungry or sated, and compared the rating differences in these states. Our results point to the representation of food value in the amygdala, and to an integration of attractiveness with hunger level in the orbitofrontal cortex. Dishes particularly desirable during hunger activated the thalamus and the insula. Our results specify the functions of evaluative structures in the context of food attractiveness, and point to a complex neural representation of dish qualities which contribute to state-dependent value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006347" title=""&gt;Do Genetic Diversity Effects Drive the Benefits Associated with Multiple Mating? A Test in a Marine Invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mothers that mate with multiple males often produce higher quality offspring than mothers that mate with a single male. By engaging in polyandry, mothers may increase their chances of mating with a compatible male or promote sperm competition - both of which act to increase maternal fitness via the biasing of the paternity of offspring. Surprisingly, mating with multiple males, can carry benefits without biasing paternity and may be due simply to differences in genetic diversity between monandrous and polyandrous clutches but role of genetic diversity effects in driving the benefits of polyandry remains poorly tested. Disentangling indirect, genetic benefits from genetic diversity effects is challenging but crucial if we are to understand the selection pressures acting to promote polyandry. Here, we examine the post-fertilisation benefits of accessing the sperm of multiple males in an externally fertilising polychaete worm. Accessing the sperm of multiple males increases offspring performance but this benefit was driven entirely by genetic diversity effects and not by the biasing of paternity at fertilisation. Previous studies on polyandry should be interpreted cautiously as genetic diversity effects alone can explain the benefits of polyandry yet these diversity effects may be difficult to disentangle from other mechanisms. We suggest that future studies use a modified experimental design in order to discriminate between genetic diversity effects and indirect, genetic benefits.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006553" title=""&gt;Brain Potentials of Conflict and Error-Likelihood Following Errorful and Errorless Learning in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to be overacting in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) reflecting an enhanced action monitoring system. However, influences of conflict and error-likelihood have not been explored. Here, the error-related negativity (ERN) originating in ACC served as a measure of conflict and error-likelihood during memory recognition following different learning modes. Errorless learning prevents the generation of false memory candidates and has been shown to be superior to trial-and-error-learning. The latter, errorful learning, introduces false memory candidates which interfere with correct information in later recognition leading to enhanced conflict processing. Sixteen OCD patients according to DSM-IV criteria and 16 closely matched healthy controls participated voluntarily in the event-related potential study. Both, OCD- and control group showed enhanced memory performance following errorless compared to errorful learning. Nevertheless, response-locked data showed clear modulations of the ERN amplitude. OCD patients compared to controls showed an increased error-likelihood effect after errorless learning. However, with increased conflict after errorful learning, OCD patients showed a reduced error-likelihood effect in contrast to controls who showed an increase. The increase of the errorlikelihood effect for OCD patients within low conflict situations (recognition after errorless learning) might be conceptualized as a hyperactive monitoring system. However, within high conflict situations (recognition after EF-learning) the opposite effect was observed: whereas the control group showed an increased error-likelihood effect, the OCD group showed a reduction of the error-likelihood effect based on altered ACC learning rates in response to errors. These findings support theoretical frameworks explaining differences in ACC activity on the basis of conflict and perceived error-likelihood as influenced by individual error learning rate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006595" title=""&gt;The Genome Response to Artificial Selection: A Case Study in Dairy Cattle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dairy cattle breeds have been subjected over the last fifty years to intense artificial selection towards improvement of milk production traits. In this study, we performed a whole genome scan for differentiation using 42,486 SNPs in the three major French dairy cattle breeds (Holstein, Normande and Montbéliarde) to identify the main physiological pathways and regions which were affected by this selection. After analyzing the population structure, we estimated FST within and across the three breeds for each SNP under a pure drift model. We further considered two different strategies to evaluate the effect of selection at the genome level. First, smoothing FST values over each chromosome with a local variable bandwidth kernel estimator allowed identifying 13 highly significant regions subjected to strong and/or recent positive selection. Some of them contained genes within which causal variants with strong effect on milk production traits (GHR) or coloration (MC1R) have already been reported. To go further in the interpretation of the observed signatures of selection we subsequently concentrated on the annotation of differentiated genes defined according to the FST value of SNPs localized close or within them. To that end we performed a comprehensive network analysis which suggested a central role of somatotropic and gonadotropic axes in the response to selection. Altogether, these observations shed light on the antagonism, at the genome level, between milk production and reproduction traits in highly producing dairy cows.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_185.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/v7Mt57PIM68" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250033496428"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/n00b_boyfriend_meets_l33t_fami.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/812bf52f71434ee9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">N00b boyfriend meets l33t family</title><published>2009-08-11T23:28:14Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T23:28:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/SGT73eWXC4E/n00b_boyfriend_meets_l33t_fami.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/n00b_boyfriend_meets_l33t_fami.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.collegehumor.com/moogaloop/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D1917993%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=360" width="640" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style="padding:5px 0;text-align:center;width:640px"&gt;See more &lt;a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/videos"&gt;funny videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/pictures"&gt;funny pictures&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/"&gt;CollegeHumor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/n00b_boyfriend_meets_l33t_fami.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/SGT73eWXC4E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250031054320"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1537">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb80b44af57a24ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="You Tube"/><category term="philosophy"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="A-Levels"/><category term="anomalistic psychology"/><category term="blogging"/><category term="Derren Brown"/><category term="Dr Chris French"/><category term="educational resources"/><category term="news"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="Richard Saunders"/><category term="teaching skepticism"/><category term="teenagers"/><category term="UK"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Teaching Anomalistic Psychology And Skepticism To Teens</title><published>2009-08-11T21:06:50Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T21:06:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/8Gk8N8hkAsc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1537"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">Interesting discussion (and clearly, rather tongue-in-cheek) stemming from a post on the Derren Brown blog in response to Dr Chris French’s article (’Spoon Bending For Beginners‘) in the Guardian.

&lt;p&gt;Bjorn Lomborg’s &lt;a href="http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/CCC%20Home%20Page.aspx"&gt;Climate Consensus Center&lt;/a&gt; just released an un-refereed report on geoengineering, &lt;a href="http://fixtheclimate.com/fileadmin/templates/page/scripts/downloadpdf.php?file=/uploads/tx_templavoila/AP_Climate_Engineering_Bickel_Lane_v.4.0.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Analysis of Climate Engineering as a Response to Global Warming&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by J Eric Bickel and Lee Lane.  The “consensus” in the title of Lomborg’s center is based on a meeting of 50 economists last year.  The problem with allowing economists to decide the proper response of society to global warming is that they base their analysis only on their own quantifications of the costs and benefits of different strategies.  In this report, discussed below, they simply omit the costs of many of the potential negative aspects of producing a stratospheric cloud to block out sunlight or cloud brightening, and come to the conclusion that these strategies have a 25-5000 to 1 benefit/cost ratio.  That the second author works for the American Enterprise Institute, a lobbying group that has been a leading global warming denier, is not surprising, except that now they are in favor of a solution to a problem they have claimed for years does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoengineering has come a long way since &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/06/geo-engineering-in-vogue/"&gt;first discussed here&lt;/a&gt; three years ago.  [Here I use the term “geoengineering” to refer to “solar radiation management” (SRM) and not to carbon capture and sequestration (called “air capture” in the report), a related topic with quite different issues.]  In a &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327191.200-interview-america-turns-red-white-and-green.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt;, John Holdren, President Obama’s science adviser, says geoengineering has to be examined as a possible response to global warming, but that we can make no such determination now.  A two-day &lt;a href="http://americasclimatechoices.org/geoengineering%20agenda.pdf"&gt;conference on geoengineering&lt;/a&gt; organized by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences was held in June, 2009, with an opening talk by the President, Ralph Cicerone.  The American Meteorological Society (AMS) has just issued a &lt;a href="http://www.ametsoc.org/policy/2009geoengineeringclimate_amsstatement.html"&gt;policy statement&lt;/a&gt; on geoengineering, which urges cautious consideration, more research, and appropriate restrictions.  But all this attention comes with the message that we know little about the efficacy, costs, and problems associated with geoengineering suggestions, and that much more study is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bickel and Lane, however, do not hesitate to write a report that is rather biased in favor of geoengineering using SRM, by emphasizing the low cost and dismissing the many possible negative aspects.  They use calculations with the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) economic model to make the paper seem scientific, but there are many inherent assumptions, and they up-front refuse to present their results in terms of ranges or error bars.  Specific numbers in their conclusions make the results seem much more certain than they are.  While they give lip service to possible negative consequences of geoengineering, they refuse to quantify them.  Indeed, the purpose of new research is to do just that, but the tone of this report is to claim that cooling the planet will have overall benefits, which CAN be quantified.  The conclusions and summary of the report imply much more certainty as to the net benefits of SRM than is really the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main areas of agreement with this report are that global warming is an important, serious problem, that SRM with stratospheric aerosols or cloud brightening would not be expensive, and that we indeed need more research into geoengineering.  The authors provide a balanced introduction to the issues of global warming and the possible types of geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bickel and Lane ignore the effects of ocean acidification from continued CO2 emissions, dismissing this as a lost cause.  Even without global warming, reducing CO2 emissions is needed to do the best we can to save the ocean.  The costs of this continuing damage to the planet, which geoengineering will do nothing to address, are ignored in the analysis in this report.  And without mitigation, SRM would need to be continued for hundreds of years.  If it were stopped, by the loss of interest or means by society, the resulting rapid warming would be much more dangerous than the gradual warming we are now experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bickel and Lane do not even mention several potential negative effects of SRM, including getting rid of blue skies, huge reductions in solar power from systems using direct solar radiation, or ruining terrestrial optical astronomy.  They imply that SRM technologies will work perfectly, and ignore unknown unknowns.  Not one cloud has ever been artificially brightened by injection of sea salt aerosols, yet this report claims to be able to quantify the benefits and the costs to society of cloud brightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also imply that stratospheric geoengineering can be tested at a small scale, but this is not true.  Small injections of SO2 into the stratosphere would actually produce small radiative forcing, and we would not be able to separate the effects from weather noise.  The small volcanic eruptions of the past year (1.5 Tg SO2 from Kasatochi in 2008 and 1 Tg SO2 from Sarychev in 2009, as compared to 7 Tg SO2 from El Chichón in 1982 and 20 Tg SO2 from Pinatubo in 1991) have produced stratospheric clouds that can be well-observed, but we cannot detect any climate impacts.  Only a large-scale stratospheric injection could produce measurable impacts.  This means that the path they propose would lead directly to geoengineering, even just to test it, and then it would be much harder to stop, what with commercial interests in continuing (e.g., Star Wars, which has not even ever worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bickel and Lane also ignore several seminal papers on geoengineering that present much more advanced scientific results than the older papers they cite.  In particular, they ignore Tilmes et al. (2008), Robock et al. (2008), Rasch et al. (2008), and Jones et al. (2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to ozone, they dismiss concerns about ozone depletion and enhanced UV by citing Wigley (2006) and Crutzen (2006), but ignore the results of Tilmes et al. (2008), who showed that the effects would prolong the ozone hole for decades and that deployment of stratospheric aerosols in a couple decades would not be safe as claimed here.  Bickel and Lane assert, completely incorrectly, “On its face, though, it does not appear that the ozone issue would be likely to invalidate the concept of stratospheric aerosols.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to an Arctic-only scheme, they suggest in several places that it would be possible to control Arctic climate based on the results of Caldeira and Wood (2008) who artificially reduce sunlight in a polar cap in their model (the “yarmulke method”), whereas Robock et al. (2008) showed with a more realistic model that explicitly treats the distribution and transport of stratospheric aerosols, that the aerosols could not be confined to just the Arctic, and such a deployment strategy would affect the summer Asian monsoon, reducing precipitation over China and India.  And Robock et al. (2008) give examples from past volcanic eruptions that illustrate this effect, such as the pattern of precipitation reduction after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption (Trenberth and Dai, 2007):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/trenberthdai07_fig3.jpg" width="90%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to cloud brightening, Bickel and Lane ignore the Jones et al. (2009) results that cloud brightening would mainly cool the oceans and not affect land temperature much, so that it is an imperfect method at best to counter global warming.  Furthermore Jones et al. (2009) found that cloud brightening over the South Atlantic would produce severe drought over the Amazon, destroying the tropical forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also ignore a huge class of ethical and world governance issues.  Whose hand would be on the global thermostat?  Who would trust military aircraft or a multi-national geoengineering company to have the interests of the people of the planet foremost?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do not seem to realize that volcanic eruptions affect climate change because of sulfate aerosols produced from sulfur dioxide gas injections into the stratosphere, the same that is proposed for SRM, and not by larger ash particles that fall out quickly after and eruption and do not cause climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They dismiss air capture (“air capture technologies do not appear as promising as solar radiation management from a technical or a cost perspective”) but ignore the important point that it would have few of the potential side effects of SRM.  Air capture would just remove the cause of global warming in the first place, and the only side effects would be in the locations where the CO2 would be sequestered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, they insist on using the wrong units for energy flux (W) instead of the correct units of W/m^2, and then mix them in the paper.  I cannot understand why they choose to make it so confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential negative consequences of stratospheric SRM were clearly laid out by &lt;a href="http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf"&gt;Robock (2008)&lt;/a&gt; and updated by &lt;a href="http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/GRLreview2.pdf"&gt;Robock et al. (2009)&lt;/a&gt;, which still lists 17 reasons why geoengineering may be a bad idea.  One of those important possible consequences, the threat to the water supply for agriculture and other human uses, has been emphasized in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/1178530.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Gabi Hegerl and Susan Solomon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/GRLreview2.pdf"&gt;Robock et al. (2009)&lt;/a&gt; also lists some benefits from SRM, including increased plant productivity and an enhanced CO2 sink from vegetation that grows more when subject to diffuse radiation, as has been observed after every recent large volcanic eruption.  But the quantification of these and other geoengineering benefits, as well as the negative aspects, awaits more research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that the benefits of geoengineering will outweigh the negative aspects, and that most of the problems can be dealt with, but the paper from Lomborg’s center ignores the &lt;em&gt;real consensus&lt;/em&gt; among all responsible geoengineering researchers.  The &lt;em&gt;real consensus&lt;/em&gt;, as expressed at the National Academy conference and in the AMS statement, is that mitigation needs to be our first and overwhelming response to global warming, and that whether geoengineering can even be considered as an emergency measure in the future should climate change become too dangerous is not now known.  Policymakers will only be able to make such decisions after they see results from an intensive research program.  Lomborg’s report should have stopped at the need for a research program, and not issued its flawed and premature conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

Not because of any suspected problems with the book — it sounds great, and I’m looking forward to reading it.  Only because we &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2006/07/20/untitled-thomas-pynchon/"&gt;previously enthused&lt;/a&gt; back on this very blog when Pynchon’s last book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Against-Day-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0143112562/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, came out — and I still haven’t gotten around to actually reading it.  Bad blogger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is too cool not to mention (via Andrew Jaffe) — the good folks at Penguin Books have come out with a “trailer” for Pynchon’s new book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/RjWKPdDk0_U%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=360" width="580" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re wondering — yes, &lt;a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2009/08/11/thomas-pynchon-speaks-inherent-vice-trailer/"&gt;that’s Pynchon reading the voice-over&lt;/a&gt;.  The man doesn’t like having his picture taken, which is perfectly understandable, but there’s no reason not to lend some authorial authority (as well as the actual text) to a video attached to one’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

This led to tax revenue amounting to £9.9 billion - £8.0 billion in excise duty plus £1.9 billion in VAT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's the aftermath - according to &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/104949.php"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;, the global smoking cessation aids market is to reach $2.6 billion By 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quite the lucrative industry all in all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are all manner of products to try and wean the addict from the evil weed, with varying degrees of success, but surprise surprise, they all require will power and rely on the person concerned having a genuine desire to give up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It shouldn't really come as a surprise for this to be a booming industry. It is notoriously hard to give up, compounded by the fact that people &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;know&lt;/span&gt; it is notoriously hard to give up and that provides its own psychological barriers. To be cynical for one second, a product which relies on will-power (regardless of whether it is Big Pharma or Big Quacka), will help to ensure repeat sales from people who won't give up giving up, and keep the tills ringing for many a moon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is happy home turf for homeopathy - a placebo remedy that depends largely on the psychology of the person, and not at all on the sugar pill. Failure is due to lack of will-power, success is due to homeopathy. FTW!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite it being illegal to sell homeopathic products in the UK with therapeutic indications (unless licenced by the Medicine and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency), it is possible to buy homeopathic products marketed at the smoker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How about a &lt;a href="http://www.smokersstopshop.co.uk/homeopathic.htm"&gt;homeopathic anti-smoking spray&lt;/a&gt; from Smoker Stop Shop?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Spray away your cravings (for tobacco smoke or chewing tobacco) with Smoke Control homeopathic oral spray. It helps with nervousness, anxiety and irritability when quitting. It can also help with cough or shortness of breath, difficult breathing and the sensation of weight on your chest from smoking.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Or what about those homeopathic detox tablets and anti-craving lozenges further down the page&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Drug Facts&lt;br&gt;Active Ingredients (per lozenge)  Purpose&lt;br&gt;Caladium seguinum 4x, 12x, 30x                 Reduces tobacco cravings&lt;br&gt;Plantago major 4x                                          Reduces tobacco cravings&lt;br&gt;Cinchona officinalis 6x, 12x, 30x                  Reduces tobacco cravings&lt;br&gt;Lobelia inflata 6x                                           Reduces ill effects of nicotine&lt;br&gt;Nux vomica 6x, 12x, 30x                              Reduces tobacco cravings&lt;br&gt;Staphysagria 6x                                             Reduces ill effects due to tobacco&lt;br&gt;Calcarea Phosphorica 12x                             Reduces tobacco cravings&lt;br&gt;Ignatia amara 12x                                          Reduces nervous tension&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seems like pretty straightforward indications for homepathic products to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the interested few, I'm led to believe that 4x dilution is equivalent to a 2c concentration. This means that 1 drop of the mother tincture has been diluted in 99 drops, hit against a magic board (succussed) and then a drop of that taken and diluted in another 99 drops and succussed again. This means that although the product is dilute, there is still some 'active' in the sugar pill. i.e it's not a homeopathic remedy in reality, it's only labelled that to pass US Food and Drug authority regulations. This crazy loophole which means that products containing 'actives' can be called homeopathic and thereby politely excuse themselves from the rigours of normal drug testing. This can mean that the untested pseudo-homeopathic products have massive unknown negative side effects and cause problems in the users - &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=530"&gt;ZiCam&lt;/a&gt; is the most recent example. A pseudo-pseudoscience, if you will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This can lead to all sorts of wacky products like &lt;a href="http://www.nwcn.com/health/stories/NW_072309HEB-nicolite-KS.6d20d2ca.html"&gt;homeopathic nicotine water&lt;/a&gt; being sold (I'm sure I can get hold of some bong-water and sell that?) - but only in US, right? Our strict laws wouldn't allow such quackery to be sold in UK?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As ever there are loopholes. Just because a site has got a '.co.uk' domain name doesn't mean it comes under UK law. As I found when I contacted my MP about a &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/09/birthday-result-artrosilium-website.html"&gt;quack arthritis product called Artrosilium&lt;/a&gt; and put a written question to the Department of Health, the UK's position is that &lt;blockquote&gt;The importation of medicines by individuals for their own personal use or for use by a family member is exempt from regulatory controls, and this includes purchases from the internet.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dawn Primarolo signed the letter. Trading Standards have &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8178959.stm"&gt;recently been warning people&lt;/a&gt; about false confidence in '.co.uk' websites with consumer goods - surely untested imported medicines with their uncontrolled, unregulated ingredients should be given higher priority than a few knocked-off hair-straighteners?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So who runs the Smoker Stop Shop (www.smokerstopshop.co.uk)? That is one Penelope Walford, who runs a private clinic in Harley Street and refers to herself as a &lt;a href="http://www.penelopewalford.com/smokingindex.html"&gt;'smoking cessation specialist'&lt;/a&gt; using hypnotherapy as her main tool. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001008.html"&gt;A Cochrane Review&lt;/a&gt; asking "Does hypnotherapy help people who are trying to stop smoking" concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;We have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt; So much for that, then. No doubt she has many positive testamonials - most placebo treatments do, and present them in place  of real evidence]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how can Penelope Walford sell homeopathic products in the UK with therapeutic indications, which is against the law? I've asked MHRA the same question - I'll let you know the response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea that homeopathy can do something for smokers to help them kick the habit is quite widespread. Other UK-based companies that seem to be up against the law are &lt;a href="http://www.bodyandmindshop.com/product/HomeopathicStopSmoking.html"&gt;The Body and Mind shop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://i-quit.co.uk/what.shtml"&gt;i-Quit&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2006/jan/07/healthandwellbeing.features"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, helpful as ever, to &lt;a href="http://www.sofeminine.co.uk/fitness/05tabac/05tabac1__cat=3&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;-Homeopathy.html"&gt;give a hand&lt;/a&gt; to evidence-free nonsense. Yet surprisingly, few of them seem to require the major magic ingredient that known to give results - willpower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;H/t to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Blue_Wode"&gt;Blue Wode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-4656188596198346175?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250025451702"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_whole_experience.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/859198f59d09d7ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">The whole experience</title><published>2009-08-11T21:54:55Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T21:54:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/9UHHEDxUWIs/the_whole_experience.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_whole_experience.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a very nicely done series of videos made at the Creation &amp;quot;Museum&amp;quot;…now you can see what it was like!&lt;/p&gt;

It is verified by the press that the vast majority of people at this town hall were randomly selected.  So, if the Teabaggers are for real, some of them should have been at this town hall mouthing off and disrupting the event.  But there was no one doing that.  The questions being asked were respectfully, though too soft-ball for Obama's taste.  He kept requesting harder questions but they were hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Libertarian with a 9mm strapped to his leg sauntering around outside making a total ass of himself.  Do people still call themselves libertarians anymore? Or is it just too embarrassing....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Senator Claire McCaskill is trying to hold a town hall meeting right now and the teabaggers are closing in, disrupting the meeting, and making general asses of themselves.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/obama_town_hall_on_health_care.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/51ke2qgYcvU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250022881235"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/why_do_palin_and_bachmann_have.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/37cb5e941d6d46bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Michele Bachmann"/><title type="html">Why do Palin and Bachmann have the same regional accent?</title><published>2009-08-11T19:22:58Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T19:22:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/MC4l3LTuQu8/why_do_palin_and_bachmann_have.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/why_do_palin_and_bachmann_have.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, there are different theories on this, and one is that there is a regional accent that runs from the great Lakes across central and western Canada and the norther Tier of the US.  That's my theory, and I think it is correct.  Furthermore, I think this accent is the product of Native American and Euro-Immigrant interaction int he 19th century through the depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that theory, as with many of my theories, gets the White Folks mad because it attributes a feature they hold dear to subaltren little brown people and they tend to find that annoying.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a new theory that is not in conflict with mine but is more detailed.: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...The reason Bachmann and Palin share a regional accent: A government-relief program in the 1930s populated Palin's home region in Alaska's Mat-Su Valley with Minnesotans..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this theory because it is annoying, like my theory, but for different reasons.  Teabag-dunking-luving Bachmann and Palin share a trait that comes from their similar backgrounds as the products of government assistance programs.  Or at least linked through such a program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what I'd like to know now, to balance the Palin-Bachmann level of government support they can attribute their very existence to, is what portion of Bachmann's income has been from the government over her lifetime.  Now she works for the government.  Before being in Congress she .... oh, she worked for the government.  But before that job? Oh, she worked for the government.  But what about when she was a stay at home mom back in the day? Well, actually, fostering several dozen children as she did, she was essentially working for the welfare department, wasn't she?  &lt;/p&gt;

Parts of the hike were extremely grueling, while other parts were quite easy and fun. I made this short video to try to capture the differences:

The music was added as an afterthought, but in the end I think it's what makes the video so charming: without it, it would just be an ordinary walk in the woods. For each section of the trail, I chose a music clip that I thought expressed our feelings as we made our way along. Most people who watch the video agree: the music is totally appropriate to the accompanying video.

We've discussed music a lot on Cognitive Daily, but one thing we haven't talked much about is how emotion in music is produced. Does it take a music expert to convey emotion through music, or can anyone do it?

A team led by Filippo Bonini Baraldi designed a musical task so easy that even an untrained individual could do it: Try to musically represent eight different "expressive intentions," as described by three adjectives (like slashing, impetuous, resolute or tender, sweet, simple). There was just one limitation: the volunteer participants could only use one musical note on an electronic keyboard for each expressive intention.

Three volunteers were trained musicians, while the other three were completely untrained. Did the performances of the musicians differ from the non-musicians? This chart shows the results:

He has now has the option to try and overturn that decision at an oral appeal. If this fails his case will be tried on a meaning of a phrase he did not intend and is indefensible. This highlights the problem of narrow defences that, along with high costs and wide jurisdiction, make the English libel laws so restrictive to free speech.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon said today: "I can confirm today that I have applied for a hearing to ask the Court of Appeal to reconsider its recent denial of permission. A great deal has happened since my original article was published back in April 2008 and I suspect that the libel case will continue for many more months (or maybe years). While my case is ongoing, it continues to raise a whole series of arguably more important issues, particularly the appalling state of English libel laws. I am pleased that the Culture Secretary has agreed to meet with signatories of the Keep Libel Laws out of Science campaign statement to hear how the laws affect writers. We are also pursuing a meeting at the Ministry of Justice and with front benchers in other departments to lobby for a change in the law."&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;British science writer and producer Simon Singh is being sued by the British Chiropractic Association for &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://newhumanist.org.uk/2089"&gt;criticising their practices&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/suck_it_ptolemy/night-sky-over-church-800.jpg" width="500" alt="night-sky-over-church-800.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you looked up periodically, you would find that the sky appears to rotate!  Some constellations rise while others set, and one point -- either due north or due south depending on your hemisphere -- appears to not move at all.  With the advent of time-lapse photography (and go &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/05/wide-angle_lenses_and_astronom.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a fantastic video), we can see that the sky does something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/suck_it_ptolemy/StarRotation.jpg" width="500" alt="StarRotation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's some pretty good evidence, right away, that either the Earth is rotating &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; the entire sky is rotating.  But there are a few bright objects in the sky that don't make this same motion every night.  A few of them move to a different point in the sky each night.  The Ancient Greeks called them planetas, or wanderers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at a planet, like Mars, relative to the other stars, it appears to zip through the sky in one predominant direction.  But every once in a while, it does something bizarre.  It stops, &lt;i&gt;goes backwards&lt;/i&gt;, stops again, and then resumes its original direction.  This -- today -- is wikipedia's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_pictures"&gt;featured picture of the day&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/suck_it_ptolemy/Apparent_retrograde_motion_of_Mars_in_2003.gif" width="500" alt="Apparent_retrograde_motion_of_Mars_in_2003.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you explain &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; one, folks?  Well, Ptolemy came up with a simple, elegant, and completely wrong explanation.  He said that instead of Mars moving in a circle around Earth, it moved on a "circle within a circle", allowing it to sometimes go backwards:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/suck_it_ptolemy/250px-Ptolemaic_elements.svg.png" width="500" alt="250px-Ptolemaic_elements.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until nearly 1500 years later, when Copernicus realized that if an inner planet moved &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; than an outer planet, it would appear that Mars moved backwards from the point of view of Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/suck_it_ptolemy/copernican-move.gif" width="500" alt="copernican-move.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the cause of the apparent "retrograde motion" of Mars.  What the history books don't tell you?  By time Copernicus came along, Mars' orbit had been so carefully studied that geocentric modelers of the Solar System had placed &lt;b&gt;seventy-eight&lt;/b&gt; epicycles on Mars' orbit!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, much like you, I wonder what blind alley we're inadvertently treading down, adding epicycles to, all because we don't have the proper perspective?  (My guess is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/dark-energy/"&gt;dark energy&lt;/a&gt;, but who knows?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/suck_it_ptolemy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250019311944"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7390/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2b0e1fad2b8a7d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Cancer Gene Complexity Revealed</title><published>2009-08-11T13:49:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T13:49:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7390/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientists have shown just how mind-bogglingly complex are the genetics underpinning the development of cancer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;People such as scientist &lt;a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that many of you saw this quote over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/08/dumbass_quote_of_the_day_47.php"&gt;Ed Brayton's blog&lt;/a&gt;, but the searing stupidity of the above statement just stands out so much that I had to add my little snark too. Can you guess why? It couldn't be because Stephen Hawking was &lt;a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/index.php/about-stephen/briefhistory"&gt;born in Oxford&lt;/a&gt; because during World War II it was considered safer to have children there than where his parents home was, namely North London. Having lived in the U.K. all of his life, since 1979, Hawking has held the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, come on. If you're going to argue that Obama's out to kill the disabled with his health care plan and use as an example a national health care system that, to you, would have let a genius like Stephen Hawking die because of his disability, shouldn't you choose one that didn't actually--you know--keep Hawking alive? If you're going to demonize President Obama's plan as euthanasia for the disabled, perhaps you should choose an example that doesn't backfire so spectacularly! Really, in his all-fired eagerness to demonize President Obama's health care plan by specious comparisons to the British NHS, couldn't this anonymous editorialist at least have gotten his facts correct? More importantly, given such a risibly stupid error, can the IBD give me one good reason why I should take any other part of that editorial seriously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who researches that sloppily very likely also thinks just as sloppily, which is one reason why there is only one appropriate reaction to such idiocy:&lt;/p&gt;

Classy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The funny part is that nobody ever accused Ham of being racist.  Rather, he was accused of promoting an idea which has a close historical association with racism, apparently ignorant of this association and its implications.  I don't imagine Ham is racist (although the "I have a black friend!" retort doesn't inspire confidence...), I just think he is ignorant and intellectually lazy.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-8922212278711166201?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250018077871"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1656">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92445760363c6c4f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Writing Systems"/><title type="html">Transletteration</title><published>2009-08-11T18:44:42Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T18:44:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1656" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend in Taiwan sent me the following inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===&lt;br&gt;
From &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/08/technology/internet/08twitter.html"&gt;an article in the NYTimes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Early Thursday, the attackers sent out a wave of spam under the name Cyxymu, which is a Latin transliteration of the Cyrillic name of the capital of Abkhazia, Sukhumi."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By which is meant that Latin Cyxymu is a "transliteration" of Cyrillic  Сухуми (in italics &lt;em&gt;С у х у м u&lt;/em&gt; ) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this is an improper use of the word "transliteration" (to refer to "Sukhumi" as a transliteration of Cyxymu, however, would be correct), but I don't know what to call this rendering of Cyrillic Cyxymu as Latin "Cyxymu".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When I asked my LLogger colleagues their opinions, I received the following suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Zwicky:  maybe it can be called "cross-alphabet transfer"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Beaver:  transletteration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Zimmer:  "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volapuk_encoding"&gt;Volapuk encoding&lt;/a&gt;," via &lt;a href="http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2006/10/nigma.html"&gt;The Tensor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mark Swofford weighed in with this:  There are probably discussions out there already on how the Russian word for restaurant appears (when written in all caps: &amp;quot;PECTOPAH&amp;quot; — sorry, not typed in real Cyrillic) to those who know the Latin but not Cyrillic alphabet as if it were a word pronounced &amp;quot;pectopah&amp;quot;. Of course, that&amp;#39;s just coincidence, not any sort of intentional letter play (at least on the part of the Russians).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===&lt;br&gt;
This reminds me of a couple of faux amis that I have encountered in Pinyin Mandarin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. A Chinese friend of mine saw a sign near our home that depicted the tracks of a railroad followed by this word XING ("crossing"), which he read as 行  ("go")!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. When I first went to Beijing in 1981, some naughty female clerks in a curio shop at the Temple of Heaven tried to embarrass me by showing me the word FUXING written on a piece of paper and asking me what it meant in English.  I played dumb and insisted that it was a Chinese word (復興) meaning "rebirth, renaissance, resurgence," etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My examples are not the same as the Cyxymu or Volapuk phenomenon, but all of these things seem like faux amis to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250017263228"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/08/the_chevy_volt_gets_230_mpg_on.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/483f49da8e1bd3d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Statistics"/><title type="html">The Chevy Volt Gets 230 mpg?

I saw this myself in a link to an &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/wires/ap/business/2009/08/11/D9A0MUK00_us_gm_volt_mileage/"&gt;AP article&lt;/a&gt; via Salon.com, and a reader sent me a link
to the same story via &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/11/autos/volt_mpg/index.htm?postversion=2009081108"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. It's yet another example of what I call a metric error: that is, the use of a measurement in a way that makes it appear to mean something very different than what it really means.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; Here's the story. Chevy is coming out with a very cool new car, the Volt. It's
a hybrid with massive batteries. It plugs in to your household electricity when you're home to charge its batteries. It operates as an electric car until its batteries start to get low, and then it starts running a small gas motor to power a generator. It's a very cool idea. I'm honestly excited about cars like the volt - and Google helped develop the technology behind it, which biases me even more in its favor. So you'd expect me to be very supportive of the hype around it, right? I wish I could. But GM has decided that the best way to promote it is to use bad math to tell lies to make it look even better than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevy has announced that for city driving, the Volt will get gas mileage of 230 miles per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; That's nonsense. Pure, utter rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

Now religious groups are &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/news/2009/08/faith-leaders-campaign-for-hea.php"&gt;getting involved&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition of Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders has launched a national campaign for health care reform, calling it a “fundamental religious issue,” in hopes of countering the vocal opposition exhibited at recent town hall meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it a “fundamental religious issue”?  Well, if he’d had health insurance, then Jesus might not have died on the cross.  Similarly, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadijah_bint_Khuwaylid#Death_.E2.80.94_619_or_623"&gt;Khadijah&lt;/a&gt; may have received better end-of-life treatment, which could have averted the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_Sorrow"&gt;Year of Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;.  And if profit-seeking insurance-company bureaucrats hadn’t considered Abraham’s foreskin a “pre-existing condition,” he wouldn’t have had to &lt;a href="http://www.christian-web-site.com/circumcision.html"&gt;circumcise himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslims seem to be moving first, offering a proposal for a new &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/africa/11briefs-Somalia.html"&gt;dental plan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The residents say anyone seen with a silver or gold tooth is taken to a masked man who then rips them out with pincers or his hands. The Shabab says gold and silver teeth are used for fashion and beauty, which is against strict interpretations of Islam, residents said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m sure the Jews and Christians have lots of good ideas too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250017061190"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/from_open_political_warfare_to.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b1adf2915f87f51</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">From open political warfare to open warfare</title><published>2009-08-11T18:17:42Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T18:17:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/-NOVTok6Gqc/from_open_political_warfare_to.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/from_open_political_warfare_to.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seemed inevitable.  &lt;a href="http://fabulousflatulence.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/brownshirts-intimidate-citizens-at-health-care-forums/"&gt;Crowds more akin to brownshirts&lt;/a&gt; than concerned citizens have been disrupting health care town hall meetings, depriving their fellow citizens of their right to be heard.  It was only a matter of time before the intimidation become more overt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://www.stltoday.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=7442668"&gt;a protester showed up&lt;/a&gt; outside a venue where the President is appearing.  His sign was disturbing enough: "It is time to water the tree of liberty!"  To refresh your memory, he is paraphrasing a famous Revolutionary-era quote which says that  to water that tree it is, from time to time, necessary to spill the blood of tyrants.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This protester is also carrying an unconcealed handgun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring for a moment the bizarre fact that the Secret Service hasn't hauled this guy away (yes, it's legal, but not if they think he poses a threat), what message is this individual sending to the people around him?  If I am there to express my opinion, and it differs from his, might he consider me a party to tyranny?  Might he not decide that I have a role to play in "watering the tree of liberty?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you stand on health care reform or the presidency, this rhetoric of violent insurgency, this infantile, anti-democratic approach to policy disagreement is dangerous.  Every pundit and politician, from every side, should be publicly decrying this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they feel safe doing so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/from_open_political_warfare_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/-NOVTok6Gqc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250016146969"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/carnival_of_space_115.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ae215127cc82857</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><title type="html">Carnival of Space #115</title><published>2009-08-11T18:57:05Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T18:57:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/carnival_of_space_115.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week's Carnival of Space comes from &lt;a href="http://www.newfrontiernews.com/?p=120"&gt;New Frontier News&lt;/a&gt;, which has the oddest banner I've seen on a serious science website in a while:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/carnival_of_space_115/NFN%20Moon%20banner%20Mom.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/carnival_of_space_115/NFN%20Moon%20banner%20Mom.jpg" width="495" height="50" alt="NFN Moon banner Mom.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top three entries this week?  As chosen, fairly arbitrarily, by me?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/carnival_of_space_115/pluto2.jpg" width="500" alt="pluto2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Pluto:&lt;/b&gt; planet or not?  Apparently, the IAU got together again, for the first serious meeting since declassifying Pluto as a planet back in 2006.  What happened?  &lt;i&gt;They didn't even talk about it.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/05/2020560.aspx"&gt;Alan Boyle has the story.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/carnival_of_space_115/mbc-panels-550x580.gif" width="500" alt="mbc-panels-550x580.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Iceteroids!&lt;/b&gt;  What do you call a half-comet, half-asteroid?  &lt;a href="http://mangsbatpage.433rd.com/2009/08/iceteroids.html"&gt;Mang at Mang's Bat Page&lt;/a&gt; talks about these newly discovered objects, called Main Belt Comets (MBCs).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Fry, Piggie, Fry!&lt;/b&gt;  What happens when a planet gets too close to its star?  Oh, the joy, the rapture, the fire, the brimstone; it's like looking into my future!  No, wait, that's not right.  Apparently, the "gas" part of gas giants simply &lt;i&gt;boil off&lt;/i&gt;, leaving a hard, dense core, like the type hypothesized to lie at the center of Jupiter.  &lt;a href="http://supernovacondensate.net/101506.html"&gt;Supernova Condensate has the story&lt;/a&gt;, if you can get past the awful naming job astronomers did for these types of planets.  (Cthonic?  I do not think it means what you think it means.)

One of the funny things about the Universe is, there’s only one way to be right, but an infinite number of ways to be wrong. For example, I know that the science of astronomy is getting better every day at describing the overall state of the Universe, approaching the ability to describe just how things work. We may never achieve that ultimate goal, but we get ever closer. Moreover, I know that astrology is completely wrong, and provably so. Even better, there are a hundred different flavors of astrology, each of which claims to work, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;yet none of which actually does&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? One way to be right, lots of ways to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once you slip off that narrow path of reality, you are surrounded by an infinitely deep fog of nonsense which just gets thicker and more difficult to navigate the farther off the path you stray. I suspect there is no actual wrongest thing in the vast reaches of antiscience, because its illogic goes on forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I had to choose, I bet reverse speech would be in the Top Ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3679456673/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2662/3679456673_3987285064_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know this idea; you take what someone says, reverse it, and find out that Paul McCartney is actually Bigfoot. Or something like that. The people who claim this is real — and yeah, they’re out there, and just as earnest as any other zealot who kneels at The Pulpit Of Nonsense — never give a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; why this works, or a mechanism that explains how reversing the time variable in a recording should yield anything but comical noises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know why this stuff &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to work when it’s presented to you: if someone primes you with a phrase that they want you to hear when speech is reversed, it really does sound like what they claim. Of course, if they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; tell you what it is, ten different people will come up with ten different phrases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why should logic, reason, and mechanics stop someone from just making stuff up? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the hilarity that is the EVP Reverse Speaking website. They claim that by reversing your speech you can learn The Great Truths (which, if it were true, would be that reverse speech is really, really silly). They even have examples! And what examples they have, oh yes indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evpreversespeaking.com/2009/07/01/the-amazing-randi-reversed-and-one-from-michael-shermer/"&gt;On this page, they reverse my own speech&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, your host and Beloved Internet Personality™. And not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; me, but also sound bites from Randi and Michael Shermer, just to hit a skeptical trifecta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I hate to make fun of people, but at some point, really, it’s simply impossible not to. In this case, this stuff is truly well and remarkably ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example: they start with an interview I did with Randi at TAM 5.  They take the audio, reverse it, and make claims that are… well, here. Listen for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evpreversespeaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/amazing-randy-2-their-walls-hit-forward.mp3"&gt;Forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.evpreversespeaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/amazing-randy-2-their-walls-hit.mp3"&gt;Reverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you listen? Try again, a couple of times. What did I say, reversed? They claim I said, &amp;quot;Their walls hit,&amp;quot; clearly meaning Randi hit an astral wall when he had his heart attack a few years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, &lt;em&gt;yeah&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny. To me it sounds like I’m saying, &amp;quot;They’re all sh*t,&amp;quot; which, had they made that claim, might actually sway me to their side. Just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best part? &lt;em&gt;They didn’t even excerpt the whole sentence I said!&lt;/em&gt; They cut the last bit of the sentence out, so what they use is, &amp;quot;Thanks a lot, Rand.&amp;quot; Note the missing &lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; at the end; not &lt;em&gt;Randi&lt;/em&gt;, just Rand. So they had to edit out part of Randi’s name to make their point… whatever the heck their point is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the site is full of incomprehensible gobbledygook just like that. It’s like someone took a bunch of ideas, wrote them down on postcards, cut them up into bits, rearranged them, and then created a website based on what they found. I suggest, dear BABloggee, that you take a look around there. It will remind you of just how silly claims can be, and just how far we skeptics have to go.&lt;/p&gt;

The issues in the letters overlap.  Much of what I suggest for one case will apply to the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, thank you for starting this “Ask the Atheist” advice column.  It is nice to have a place where we can get advice from someone without the “god will guide you,” and “pray about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, my question.  I am an atheist, but have not quite fully come out to my family.  They know I am not religious, but I have never said “I am an atheist.”  My parents are very religious.  I have a decent relationship with them, and I know that they already don’t fully approve of my lifestyle (living with a girlfriend, child out of wedlock.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother will be coming out to visit us for our daughter’s 4th birthday later this month.  We had stayed in their house for a while, when they were traveling, and when they came back we made a point of putting away all of our atheist/irreverent books and movies, so as not to cause any drama.  Now she is coming to my home, and will undoubtedly see my bookshelf.  I don’t want to ruin our relationship (especially for my daughter’s sake), but fear that this may be a final straw for her.  Is there any safe way to handle this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filius
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband and I are both atheists who were raised catholic.  I am a bit more “militant” in my atheism but overall we agree on most issues involving religion.  The one place we don’t agree is in regards to coming out about our atheism to our other family members, who are all fairly devout Catholics.  I told my family about my lack of belief as soon as I was no longer living with them, and although we fought about it a lot at the time, our relationship now is just as good as ever and I’m glad to have it out in the open.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband on the other hand has never told his parents about his atheism or mine and doesn’t plan to, because he says he doesn’t want to upset them or give them cause for worry.  This makes me feel really uncomfortable around them, especially when they pray over meals, or ask us about local churches etc.   The funny thing is, our wedding was completely god-free, in a garden with a UU minister and a ceremony we totally put together ourselves, so it should be obvious that we aren’t catholic at least.  I’m just not sure why keeping quiet to his family to keep the peace is worth the tension it causes between my husband and I.  Any thoughts on how to deal with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Catholic Wife
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dear Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much liked your response to the question of &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/15/ask-richard-being-an-%E2%80%9Cout%E2%80%9D-atheist-without-being-a-jerk/"&gt;how to be an “Out Atheist”&lt;/a&gt; in online forums and discussions.  It was well thought-out and reasoned, and addresses something that I’ve struggled with (and continue to struggle with) in online discussions on both religion and politics to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I want to ask is related, but slightly different.  How do I be an “Out Atheist” in my real life?  More generally, how do I lead a life with my friends where I am true to my ideals and beliefs without alienating people and being an overbearing jerk about them?  For instance, many in my family are very religious, and I generally tend not to talk about these things with them so as to not make waves.  But what if these issues come up?  How do I stay true to my own beliefs without damaging a relationship that I really don’t want to damage?  More generally, how do I do this with friends (and it doesn’t necessarily have to be on the subject of atheism)?  For instance, when a friend says that something is “gay” meaning that it’s bad, do I do more damage to my friendship by calling him out on it than I do to myself by remaining silent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot for your advice, Richard.  Keep up the good work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Filius, Ex-Catholic Wife and Tim,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer: There are no painless solutions to these problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long answer:  Every solution to problems like these is a trade-off.  They all have costs and benefits. Choosing the best solution may be easy or hard, and then we take our chances, but there are some ways to increase the odds of a better outcome. I’ll get to those later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filius, sometimes there is a difference between the short term and the long term costs and benefits of a solution.  For instance, in the case of your atheist books, the short term solution at first seems obvious. Simply hide the books in your house that might upset your mother just as you had while staying at her house.  Problem solved… for now.  However, that’s only a postponement of a crisis that probably cannot be prevented forever.  As Shakespeare said, “Truth will out.”  In some situations, putting off the upsetting truth makes it easier to take later, but in other situations, doing that will just make it all the worse later.  Even if the difficulty is not changed by delaying, your enjoyment of the “peace” you’re keeping is to some extent spoiled by the fear of being discovered and the resentment from having to pretend to be something you’re not in front of your loved ones, even in your own home.  If the truth will out sooner or later, it might be preferable to have it come out in a controlled situation of your design, rather than haphazardly.  You may be underestimating your mother’s resiliency, as well as underestimating the leverage you possess in her granddaughter.  Will there be upset? Most likely.  Will it last a lifetime?  Probably not.   Will it be good to not have to hide things? Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Catholic Wife, your letter describes how when two partners have different solutions to the same problem, that difference can become a bigger problem than the first.  You have gone through the difficulties of coming out to your family, and after some time you are now enjoying the benefit of  improved relationships and the ability to be genuine in their presence. Your husband wants to keep it all a secret from his family, and so you feel awkward going between the open family and the secretive one.  So now the tension and resentment have shifted more between the two of you than between either of you and either family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to him about the bond, the alliance, the unity between the two of you.  &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; the most important relationship in your lives.  Share with him what you went through before, during and after you came out to your family; the fear that held you back, the anger and hurt that you endured once you had told your truth, and the eventual relief and healing that came later.  Ask him if he feels like he has to hold back truths from you as well, for fear of your not accepting.  Patiently coax him to first be more open and risk-taking with you, if need be, and reward him with acceptance.  Let him see that you understand his fear about his family from your own experience, and that you have confidence that he, with your support, will be able to go through the difficult truth-telling process with them, and the two of you will emerge on the other side with a stronger marriage as well as better family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim, your letter very clearly illustrates the almost universal struggle between our desire to be ourselves and our desire to be loved.  Friendships and family relationships that require us to have less of one in order to have more of the other need to be improved at their foundation. Before finding how to talk about a touchy subject, you must first talk about the relationship itself, about how you want it to be more mutually open and accepting.  If you feel stifled by what you sense are restrictions on what you can say, perhaps the other person feels stifled too, about other topics.  Gradually establish a right to free speech between you.  Give permission to the other to respectfully confront you if you step on their toes, and ask for the same permission in return. If talking about talking, about the relationship itself feels awkward at first, then go right ahead and talk about that awkwardness. It’s all part of laying a foundation of trust and respect that will withstand the stress of disagreement. Try out a couple of easier subjects for frankness before moving on to the heavier, riskier feeling ones.  Each time you successfully broach a sensitive matter, that adds strength to your foundation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases like these three, it is fear that holds us hostage.  We fear someone else’s fear, the fear that our family and friends have for our unbelief, our difference from them.  They have been taught to fear unbelief and unbelievers, or anything different from their beliefs. They may react with what looks like anger, indignation or disgust, but the root is actually fear.  They’re not bad, they’re afraid.  Remembering that can help you to use the universal solvent for fear, love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not dismiss my invocation of love as a corny cliché or a platitude.  It works.  When revealing fear-inducing truths to your family and friends, Always begin, continue and end with love. Saying again and again  “I love you” literally, as well as in your tone, in your body language, and in your actions will disperse their fear and the other emotions that spring from it.  Whether you’re saying “Mom, I’m an atheist,” or “John, saying ‘gay’ to mean ‘bad’ hurts my feelings,” if “I love you” is clearly part of your statement, then most likely they’ll be better able to deal with it.  Sometimes this is a slow process, but if you patiently, &lt;em&gt;patiently&lt;/em&gt; keep soaking your truthful words with your love for your family and friends, their fear will gradually dissolve, and your freedom from keeping secrets will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

He's upset that I pointed out that one of his displays is a relic of a racist theory of human origins. And it is! He does a bit of yelling about credentials, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this professor seems to have a fixation on me--yet, our own full-time PhD scientists and many other scientists who work in the secular world provided the research for the museum scripts. But, then again, he wouldn't want to acknowledge that people with better qualifications than he holds (qualifications obtained from secular universities, including PhDs from Ivy League schools like Harvard and Brown) were behind the Creation Museum teaching. This man is obviously very angry at God and relishes in mocking Christianity--spending a lot of his time fighting against Someone he doesn't believe exists!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These highly qualified PhD "scientists" believe in talking snakes, global floods, an earth that poofed into existence more than 10,000 years &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the domestication of the dog, and that they can make a case against evolution by ignoring almost all of the evidence. They can wave their diplomas all they want, but against that palpable nonsense, I reject them bemusedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I'm not fighting against any of the gods, since they don't exist. I do oppose the charlatans who claim they speak for the gods, because those frauds &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; exist. See "Ham, Ken" in the Kentucky phone book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His anger stems from the fact that I showed this image from the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/hamite.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/hamite-thumb-337x200-17254.jpeg" width="337" height="200" alt="hamite.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With complete seriousness and no awareness of the historical abuses to which this idea has been put, they were promoting the Hamite theory of racial origins, that ugly idea that all races stemmed from the children of Noah, and that black people in particular were the cursed offspring of Ham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He demands that I document my claims…but I already did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the pretty picture (you can click on it to get a larger, readable version). Several times, it states that all races stemmed from the children of Noah. The picture specifically shows that Africans are descendants of Ham. Now go read the book of Genesis, which as we all know, AiG insists we must take absolutely literally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Ham, the father of all African peoples by this account, sees Noah drunk and naked, and Noah curses his child Canaan to be a servant of servants (what a nice Grandpa!). This is the doctrine that led apologists for slavery to declare that the children of Ham, that is Africans, were ordained to be servants. That&amp;#39;s the Hamite theory. It&amp;#39;s a completely bogus theory, wrong in all of its facts, and if Ken Ham is trying to defang its implications, good for him…but he&amp;#39;s still promoting a racist Biblical explanation that is false in all of its particulars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually know quite a bit more about human ancestry than a gang of bronze age goatherds did. This is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/09/my_human_lineage.php"&gt;my genetic history&lt;/a&gt;, a map of the migrations of various genetic groups over tens of thousands of years. Note that we all came out of Africa. Note also that this map does not correspond at all to Ken Ham's map of the magical diaspora of 2348 BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/i_think_we_successfully_poked/pz_hapgroups.jpeg" width="360" height="469" alt="pz_hapgroups.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very nice of Ken Ham to now clearly deny the racism implicit in any literal interpretation of the Bible, and I urge him to continue in his progress towards recognizing the metaphorical aspect of these fables. Maybe soon we'll even get him to realize that you can't use the Bible to argue against "millions of years", either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do recommend that he avoid the "some of my best friends are black" excuse. It's very condescending and hokey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, as this atheist was falsely accusing us of racism, I was in Seattle speaking in the church led by a black pastor--and a good friend of our ministry. See the photo of me and Pastor Hutchinson a former NFL football player. And I spoke Sunday evening against racism!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep speaking against racism, Mr Ham. But I think your words would be more meaningful if they were accompanied by commendable actions…such as ceasing the promotion of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/i_think_we_successfully_poked.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/zI33Dc5BY20" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250013285559"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3814">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9a97827aa3abf4c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><title type="html">Mooney and Kirshenbaum self-destruct at last</title><published>2009-08-11T17:25:02Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T17:25:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/mooney-and-kirshenbaum-self-destruct-at-last/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this post, I’m not going to be writing about these two any more; I’ve had my say about their book, and I’ve watched in disgust as they engaged in frenzied and nearly duplicitous self-promotion while ignoring or distorting reasonable criticisms of their book.  I’ve also seen them move from &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/what-am-i-supposed-to-do-with-unscientific-america/#comment-5194"&gt;wanting my take&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;, saying that they thought it would be “balanced and fair,” to then&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/27/some-more-words-to-the-new-atheist-blogosphere-on-unscientific-america/"&gt; dismissing my critical opinion&lt;/a&gt; on the grounds that I’m a biased “new atheist.”  I’m sorry, but my opinion was indeed balanced and fair: &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; is simply a bad book, shallow, unreflective, and not worth buying or reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now Mooney and Kirshenbaum have published an equally &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/religion/la-oe-mooney11-2009aug11,0,3325228.story?track=rss"&gt;shallow and unreflective editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;L. A. Time&lt;/em&gt;s. It’s a rambling, confused piece, accusing the new atheists of hurting science literacy, implying that Richard Dawkins has, in the main, impeded the acceptance of evolution, and even invoking the ghost of Charles Darwin against us. (Why are we supposed to worship everything that Darwin ever said? He was a man, not a god.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to dissect their piece in detail: as usual, P.Z. at &lt;em&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_mooneykirshenbaum_crusade.php"&gt;beaten me to the punch&lt;/a&gt;, and I have little to add to his lucubrations.  And the crowd here should be well familiar with M&amp;amp;K’s arguments.  I just want to say two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  The “new atheists” have been on the scene for exactly five years, beginning with Sam Harris’s &lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt;, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;2004.  But American’s attitudes to evolution have been relatively unchanged (with 40+% denying it)&lt;em&gt; for twenty-five years&lt;/em&gt;.  This means two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.  American illiteracy about evolutionary biology cannot have been due to criticism of religion by the “new atheists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.  The dominant strategy of scientific organizations engaged in fighting creationism over the past twenty-five years has been &lt;em&gt;accommodationism&lt;/em&gt;: coddling or refusing to criticize religious people for fear of alienating those of the faithful who support evolution. This has been combined with incessant claims that science and religion are perfectly compatible.   &lt;em&gt;This strategy has not worked. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    M&amp;amp;K have repeatedly noted that religious people have a problem with evolution &lt;em&gt;because of religion&lt;/em&gt;, and yet they bray incessantly that &lt;em&gt;religion is not the problem&lt;/em&gt;: it’s those pesky new atheists.  Here is what they say about &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/22/truckling-to-the-faithful-a-spoonful-of-jesus-helps-darwin-go-down/"&gt;my criticisms of the National Center for Science Education’s (NCSE) “Faith Project”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this, Coyne is once again following the lead of Dawkins, who in “The God Delusion” denounces the NCSE as part of the “Neville Chamberlain school of evolutionists,” those equivocators who defend the science but refuse to engage with what the New Atheists perceive as the real root of the problem — namely, religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course they claim that such criticisms are mistaken and counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will say this to Mooney and Kirshenbaum one last time, without hope that they’ll absorb it or even respond to it:  &lt;em&gt;the strategy you suggest has not worked. &lt;/em&gt; We’ve been making nice with religion for decades, and America remains as “unscientific” as ever. We don’t just &lt;em&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt; religion as the root of the problem, it IS the root of the problem.  Even you, Mooney and Kirshenbaum, must admit that. And many of us feel that Americans won’t begin to accept evolution — or indeed, become more rational about &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; scientific issues, including stem-cell research and global warming — until they abandon the anti-rational habits of religion.  The “new atheists” are against religion because it is inimical to rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:   &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/gregfish/2009/08/11/mooney-and-co-tries-to-muzzle-dawkings/"&gt;Greg Fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolutionblog/2009/08/one_more_round_with_m_and_k.php#more"&gt;Jason Rosenhouse&lt;/a&gt; have just posted good critiques of M&amp;amp;K’s editorial.&lt;/p&gt;

The atheist biologist Jerry Coyne of the University of Chicago, for instance, &lt;i&gt;has drawn much attention&lt;/i&gt; by assaulting the center's Faith Project, which seeks to spread awareness that between creationism on the one hand and the new atheism on the other lie many more moderate positions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emphasis is mine.  Now tell me, who exactly was it that drew all this attention to Coyne's initial complaint about the NCSE?  Oh that's right, it was the accomodationists!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A balanced history of this whole debate would be that a few "New Atheist" bloggers commented about how, as much as they love the NCSE, they think the center's Faith Project is inconsistent with the center's own stated goals, and wish they wouldn't do that.  Then Chris Mooney pitched a hissy fit of the highest order, wrote a &lt;i&gt;fucking book about it&lt;/i&gt;, and basically ensured that this little disagreement over outreach strategy got completely magnified out of all proportion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the accomodationists want to stop this alleged "assault" on the NCSE's "other flank", all they have to do is say, "We understand how you feel, but we think the Faith Project is useful and we're not going to stop."  It's the whole, "How dare you say that faith and science are incompatible!!!11111!!!!" attitude that is "drawing so much attention."&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2907121387739788310?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250011153639"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/08/11/scripps-scicomm-post-iv-jennifer-ouellette-on-science-in-hollywood/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e83f9db05474bb37</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Hollywood and Science"/><category term="Media and Science"/><title type="html">Scripps SciComm Post IV: Jennifer Ouellette on Science in Hollywood</title><published>2009-08-11T16:45:12Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T16:45:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/08/11/scripps-scicomm-post-iv-jennifer-ouellette-on-science-in-hollywood/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We started off this morning with a real treat: A talk by Jennifer Ouellette, science writer and now director of the the National Academy of Sciences’ &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/"&gt;Science and Entertainment Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Jennifer talked about how despite past tensions between the two groups–and occasionally egregious anti-science, like the &lt;em&gt;Eli Stone&lt;/em&gt; anti-vaccine storyline–Hollywood now appears to be increasingly interested in real science and the plots it can impel. Granted, there are still plenty of “socially inept nerds” and “literally mad scientists” (as in &lt;em&gt;Fringe&lt;/em&gt;) to be found; but such stereotypes are increasingly balanced by really good stuff, like &lt;em&gt;Bones &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Numb3rs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer’s central point was that scientists have to stop being in full-on criticism mode towards entertainment, and instead, should work to bridge the gap with creative people–who are very open to using as much science as they can to tell a good story. We all just need to take our defenses down, and focus on commonalities rather than differences. That’s what the National Academies started late last year with a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/11/attack-of-the-nerds-from-outer-space/"&gt;gala event&lt;/a&gt; bringing together luminaries from both fields, and “they just started talking to each other,” said Jennifer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; scientists swooping in to correct Hollywood,” she emphasized. “We do not ’scold’!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer then went into much more detail about her job–how the Exchange helps Hollywood’s writers and other creative talent get science content into their work. Some TV shows have a regular science consultants, knowing they will regularly need them (e.g., &lt;a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~saltzbrg/bio.html"&gt;David Salzberg &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;); in other cases, it’s a one-off affair. Most of the consultants aren’t paid; this is generally a nonprofit endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the NAS Exchange is among the best and most innovative programs out there for bringing science into a new and different arena; hopefully Jennifer’s presentation was as eye-opening to the students as I had hoped!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250010837671"><id gr:original-id="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/?p=1713">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e846630ae0314051</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="1"/><title type="html">Presidents from small/medium universities respond to the “G5″</title><published>2009-08-11T16:57:10Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T16:57:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/presidents-from-smallmedium-universities-respond-to-the-g5/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://dontleavecanadabehind.wordpress.com/" type="html">Maclean’s has published an article in which presidents from seven small and medium universities respond to a previously published call to rethink the one-size-fits-all approach to Canadian universities.

It's wonderful. He's really peeved at the ABC News report because it mentioned a detail that is thoroughly trivial, but he claims is wrong. &lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2009/08/09/you-think-you%E2%80%99ve-heard-it-all-till-the-abc/"&gt;The report describes how animals spread around the world after the Flood on floating islands of matted logs and plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do have replicas of Darwin's Finches in the exhibit on Natural Selection where we discuss genetics and speciation, not God's will!!--and we do talk about floating log mats after the Flood, but certainly nothing about "mankind spread from continent by walking across the floating trunks of trees knocked down during the Biblical Flood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now see, this is where all the pictures we took in the museum become a very useful resource. I just rummaged about, and there they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a text panel that talks about his imaginary "floating forest", giant rafts on which plants and animals spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41325222@N02/3809648093/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/floating_forest.jpeg" width="450" height="303" alt="floating_forest.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's his big map of the routes life took. One thing I can't find a picture of, because it was a video that was playing, was this same sort of map, animated, with streams of log shaped objects swirling about in the ocean currents. It was there, believe me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/danmacduff/AdamEvePrepareToSinCreationExplainedForTheAnxiousAndGullible#5368437698852779442"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/routes.jpeg" width="450" height="272" alt="routes.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's this. It was a huge painting of one of his giant floating islands. I remember it vividly, because it contained the only image in the whole place of a cephalopod (the small blob on the far right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/danmacduff/AdamEvePrepareToSinCreationExplainedForTheAnxiousAndGullible#5368437537817637282"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/island.jpeg" width="450" height="300" alt="island.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely how Ham explains the dissemination of humanity after his Big-Ass Flood. Humans rode across the oceans on mats and clumps and lumps of floating debris that were churning about in the ocean currents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PWNZ0RED&lt;/b&gt;, Ken Ham!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more display from the museum: see, they were talking about log rafts.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm reading it in complete bafflement: what is their argument? What are they trying to do? Because &lt;i&gt;none of it makes sense&lt;/i&gt;. It's confusing, right from the beginning, in which they sneer at Richard Dawkins for publishing a new book about science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fall, evolutionary biologist and bestselling author Richard Dawkins -- most recently famous for his public exhortation to atheism, "The God Delusion" -- returns to writing about science. Dawkins' new book, "The Greatest Show on Earth," will inform and regale us with the stunning "evidence for evolution," as the subtitle says. It will surely be an impressive display, as Dawkins excels at making the case for evolution. But it's also fair to ask: Who in the United States will read Dawkins' new book (or ones like it) and have any sort of epiphany, or change his or her mind?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Surely not those who need it most: America's anti-evolutionists. These religious adherents often view science itself as an assault on their faith and doggedly refuse to accept evolution because they fear it so utterly denies God that it will lead them, and their children, straight into a world of moral depravity and meaninglessness. An in-your-face atheist touting evolution, like Dawkins, is probably the last messenger they'll heed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. It looks to be a very good book, and I can practically guarantee it will appear on the NY Times bestseller list in very short order (I think I can also guarantee that its sales will leave &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt; in the dust, which may be the prime motivator for this sniping). There will be people who have epiphanies when they read popular science, just as happened to me when I started reading about evolution in my youth, and as I'm sure other people will testify in the comments here, but I think most people write, not for epiphanies, but to inform. Do Mooney and Kirshenbaum seriously believe the new Dawkins book will accomplish absolutely nothing? What an attitude of futility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a cute trick, though, parlaying a mention of a science book by Dawkins into a condemnation of his existence as a harbinger of total moral depravity. That's what the leaders of creationism do; I think we can give the rank-and-file a little more credit, though, and I wouldn't be surprised if a few of them, after hearing all the hysteria about Evil Old Man Dawkins from people like Ham and Hovind and Mooney, might actually read something by him and realize that he's a decent fellow after all, and he actually explains evolution clearly. It can't hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what do Mooney and Kirshenbaum want now? Is this a plea for Dawkins to stop writing books of any kind, to cancel the print run for &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/i&gt;, or to convert to some conventional piety? This opening makes no sense, unless it's just that they don't like the fact that an openly atheist scientist writes without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just Dawkins. They really don't like me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Atheists win the battle easily on the Internet. Their most prominent blogger, the University of Minnesota biologist P.Z. Myers, runs what is probably the Web's most popular science blog, Pharyngula, where he and his readers attack and belittle religious believers, sometimes using highly abrasive language. Or as Myers put it to fanatical Catholics at one point: "Don't confuse the fact that I find you and your church petty, foolish, twisted and hateful to be a testimonial to the existence of your petty, foolish, twisted, hateful god." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; what I say sometimes. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php#comment-1010788"&gt;Here's the full quote&lt;/a&gt;, which was a reply to the people complaining about me trashing a cracker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What effort I put into it was not in response to the reality of your silly deity, but in response to the reality of your dangerous delusions. Those are real, all right, and they need to be belittled and weakened. But don't confuse the fact that I find you and your church petty, foolish, twisted, and hateful to be a testimonial to the existence of your petty, foolish, twisted, hateful god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Mooney and Kirshenbaum would like to suggest some alternative language? It has to &lt;i&gt;communicate&lt;/i&gt; (you know, that precious word) my actual intent and feelings and beliefs, though, not their imaginary precious deference to faith. Clarity is a good thing, I would think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, these guys don't understand anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long under fire from the religious right, the NCSE now must protect its other flank from the New Atheist wing of science. The atheist biologist Jerry Coyne of the University of Chicago, for instance, has drawn much attention by assaulting the center's Faith Project, which seeks to spread awareness that between creationism on the one hand and the new atheism on the other lie many more moderate positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCSE is not under attack from us. I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; the NCSE, and think it is a valuable institution; when I give science advocacy talks, I tell people to join the organization. That does not mean, however, that we therefore think that we cannot criticize the NCSE. Eugenie Scott isn't our Pope. We think that they've taken a wrong turn and are plainly speaking out in protest, while (at least in my case) still sending in our membership dues, and encouraging others to donate as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our criticism is that promotion of "moderate positions". The NCSE should not be taking &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; position on religions at all. Mooney and Kirshenbaum have just berated Dawkins for being openly atheist, claiming that that means no creationist will ever listen to him. Do they think that if the NCSE endorses the Episcopalians and Methodists and Universalists, that that will somehow endear them to the fundamentalists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, M&amp;amp;K take the low road and dig up the corpse of Darwin and make him waggle his bony finger at us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the resultant bitterness, however, there is at least one figure both sides respect -- the man who started it all: Charles Darwin. What would he have done in this situation?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It turns out that late in life, when an atheist author asked permission to dedicate a book to Darwin, the great scientist wrote back his apologies and declined. For as Darwin put it, &amp;quot;Though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet it appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity &amp;amp; theism produce hardly any effect on the public; &amp;amp; freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men&amp;#39;s minds, which follows from the advance of science.&amp;quot; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Darwin and Dawkins differ by much more than a few letters, then -- something the New Atheists ought to deeply consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, Jebus. What a crock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin is not our saint. We disagree with Darwin on many things; we can agree that he was a brilliant scientist and entirely admirable person without feeling that we must therefore emulate him in every particular, or obey his every dictum. I also don't think that Mooney and Kirshenbaum have earned the privilege of hiding behind Darwin's skirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin was a bourgeois Victorian gentleman, living in the 19th century, with fairly conservative social sensibilities. In case they hadn't yet noticed, we are now living in the 21st century. Our culture is, I hope, a little bit more flexible on matters of religion than his was, and we aim to push a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in case they hadn't noticed, what Darwin is advocating is the gradual illumination of minds with science by, for instance, publishing books about science for the lay public. Books that, for example, might lay out the evidence for evolution. Books with titles like &lt;i&gt;The Greatest Show on Earth&lt;/i&gt;. Books that M&amp;amp;K belittle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, try comparing the opening of their essay with its high-minded conclusion. Have we just determined that a 12 paragraph span is far enough that M&amp;amp;K will lose their train of thought and contradict themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can quote Charles Darwin, too. I prefer this line, in which he argues how best to defend his theory of evolution. It also applies to any idea anyone might think worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction; for thus only can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose to &lt;b&gt;conscientiously express my convictions&lt;/b&gt;. I will laugh at those who think the best way to advance my ideas is by being more mealy-mouthed and by pandering to superstition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_mooneykirshenbaum_crusade.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jDLTlnMeQ1s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250008996327"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=16387">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b6d0d6de77c891d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="prison"/><title type="html">Pay-If-You-Go Prisons?</title><published>2009-08-11T16:17:55Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T16:17:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/pay-if-you-go-prisons/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Inspired by Bernie Madoff's 150-year prison sentence, New York state assemblyman Jim Tedesco introduced a bill that, as the Economist reports, would establish a "pay-if-you-go" model for prisons, whereby wealthy inmates pay for their own incarceration costs, thereby easing the burden on taxpayers.</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250008222248"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/08/the-dude-abides/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d3cda5e53dfacd8a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">The Dude Abides</title><published>2009-08-11T15:52:43Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T15:52:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/08/the-dude-abides/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Dude Abides&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250007966150"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/ron_paul_quackery_enabler_part_ii.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8e1503a749b7d92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Ron Paul: Quackery enabler, part II</title><published>2009-08-11T14:16:37Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T14:16:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/_vssoejD9vE/ron_paul_quackery_enabler_part_ii.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/ron_paul_quackery_enabler_part_ii.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I've let myself get sucked into commenting on health care politics (well, not exactly "sucked in"; I was pissed off enough at the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/the_latest_obama_hitler_shenanigans_too.php"&gt;Obama = Hitler&lt;/a&gt;" analogies that I enjoyed skewering some of the idiots making them), there's another issue that's popped up that I can't resist commenting on in my usual inimitable fashion. It comes from, of all places, this blog's favorite den of quackery propaganda, NaturalNews.com and from, of all places, one of our favorite wingnut politicians, a man who's been a tireless promoter of quackery in Congress for many years now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right, Ron Paul's back, baby, and Mike Adams' minions love him to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/ron_paul_quackery_enabler.php"&gt;written about Ron Paul before&lt;/a&gt;, of course, back before the primary season for the 2008 election really got going. This was before a single vote was cast or single delegate awarded, and, back at that time, thanks to his Internet fundraising juggernaught, Ron Paul actually looked like a bona fide contender for the Republican nomination for President. I noted at the time that, while numerous other bloggers had expressed concern about Ron Paul's--shall we say?--unusual beliefs, none of them realized just how much of a promoter of pseudoscience he was, how vigorously he promotes quackery. Indeed, you could look at Ron Paul as being the Republican counterpart of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/senator_tom_harkin.php"&gt;Senator Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt;, only without the same level of clout and without the same level of cleverness that allows Harkin to cloak his promotion of pseudoscience as "health promotion." Instead, Ron Paul is once again enthusiastically trying to gut consumer health protections in the name of "health freedom." If you think the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html"&gt;Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/dshea_a_travesty_of_a_mockery.php"&gt;an atrocity&lt;/a&gt; you ain't seen nothin' yet; that is, &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/026810_health_free_speech_Ron_Paul.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;if Ron Paul ever gets his way&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/ron_paul_quackery_enabler_part_ii.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/ron_paul_quackery_enabler_part_ii.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_vssoejD9vE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250006815189"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/may_the_force_of_the_command_l.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e908fde30c1bbcf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">May the force (of the command line) be with you</title><published>2009-08-11T16:59:57Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T16:59:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/AGlNJiIat5Q/may_the_force_of_the_command_l.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/may_the_force_of_the_command_l.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of a series of posts on the Power of the Command Line.

It's almost unavoidable since I use the encyclopedia daily and keep running into stuff to correct -- facts, spelling, stylistic mishaps. In the past, though, I've been really discouraged when trying to improve the articles about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. Chinese Scientology). They used to be a battleground between Chinese Communist Party loyalists and Falun Gong devotees, both sides trying to cram as much propaganda into the articles as possible. Then the FGers managed to get the CCP guys banned from editing, which was excellent in itself. Unfortunately it led to a prolonged situation where the articles were entirely taken over by cult propagandists, some of whom checked the articles five times a day. And then I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/03/wikipedians_check_this_out.php"&gt;got involved&lt;/a&gt;. As it turned out, I could do very little on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back in May, English Wikipedia &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/29/wikipedia_bans_scientology/"&gt;barred&lt;/a&gt; all users on servers belonging to the Church of Scientology from editing the encyclopedia, and two dozen individual user accounts on Wikipedia were zapped too because they had been used extensively to push the Scientology agenda. The crackdown took a lot of work since these decisions aren't made lightly: you need to document in detail &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; somebody needs to get kicked out. And now a similar clean-up effort has reached the Falun Gong pages. A swarm of experienced Wikipedians with no pro-FG or pro-CCP agenda has descended on them. Yesterday the nastiest of the FGers (a fellow Scandy, no less) was banned for six months from touching any of the FG articles. And the delicious irony is that this is the very same guy who got the CCP propagandists thrown out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind all this clean-up is of course that if a person looks up an organisation on Wikipedia, then the article will be pretty useless if it's written by people with any sort of passionate relationship to that organisation. If they hate it, if they love it, they're not the right people to write about it. Myself, I dislike both FG and CCP since I see them as a crazy cult and a totalitarian regime respectively, but I can't say that I have any strong feelings about either. I just want those articles to be fair, well-sourced and factually correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I am kind of passionate, though, about those FG propagandists on Wikipedia who kept erasing everything I wrote. So the ongoing change is a double pleasure for me: a set of much-read Wikipedia articles will finally become worth reading, and the doublespeaking cultists I've had to deal with get their just deserts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on Wikipedia, vigilance must be eternal, because one day new propagandists will appear. They'll start small just to see if anybody's paying attention...&lt;/p&gt;

That interface with the general public is poorly cobbled together and we often seem to be working in completely different directions, producing a lot of, well, &lt;i&gt;chafing&lt;/i&gt;, where the citizenry is off supporting some lunacy like creationism or homeopathy and pissing us off, and we&amp;#39;re grumpily tossing off thunderbolts of scorn and pissing them off…and unfortunately, we do not have the benefit of the automatic deference given to such scoundrels as the clergy. I suppose we could aspire to indoctrinate the public into believing in our infallibility and saintliness, but it seems to me that learning how to communicate better would be &lt;i&gt;easier&lt;/i&gt;. Not easy, of course, but at least achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I admit that scientists need to improve their communication skills, you may have noticed that I tend to be scathing in my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php"&gt;reviews of pundits who try to tell us how to be better communicators&lt;/a&gt;. Too often they seem to have no understanding of how scientists actually think; they're outsiders who don't seem to understand &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; perspective while telling us to bow to the whims of non-scientists. They're also fond of dispensing generic advice, like "get more education in communication!", without actually telling us any specifics. It gets rather infuriating after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's Randy Olson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can be very annoying, and even infuriating, too: his movies, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/sizzle_a_global_warming_comedy.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sizzle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/flock_of_dodos.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flock of Dodos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, generate some interesting reactions from scientists, where "interesting" covers a range of emotions from bafflement to outrage. But the reasons he annoys are different from the way the communications experts and framers and media folk are exasperating: in his case, it's because he actually is a real scientist, one who left the ivory tower to try and succeed in the fantasy land of Hollywood. He has more credibility and a more informed view of both sides of the argument, so his criticisms have a little more bite to them. He's also a weird chimera, a kind of crocoduck of the science and media worlds, so he freaks us out a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randy has a new book out, &lt;i&gt;Don't Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1597265632/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=1597265632&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=1597265632&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=1597265632" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It's another of that genre that nags scientists to be better communicators, but it's a &lt;i&gt;productive&lt;/i&gt; kind of nag. He tells us exactly what the public finds annoying about us, and is specific about what we should do differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a short book with chapters with simple commandments: don't be so cerebral, don't be so literal minded, don't be such a poor storyteller, and don't be so unlikeable, and each chapter is illustrated with stories from his experiences in the transition from science to movie making (See? He's practicing what he preaches, by trying to be a good storyteller.) There is plenty of material here to convince any empiricist that we need to change our attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, he gives the case of the Pew Oceans Commission report, a major scientific policy report that should have fired people up to protect our coastal resources. Most of you probably haven&amp;#39;t heard about it — I hadn&amp;#39;t — because scientists sunk a huge amount of effort into it, and then plunked it down on desks in Washington DC…and left it to speak for itself. They invested a grand total of 3% of their budget in marketing. Randy reports that one of the staff members said, at the completion of the study, that &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not sure we&amp;#39;ve even got enough money for coffee at the press conference.&amp;quot; Compare that to a movie that was released at about the same time as the report, &lt;i&gt;Napoleon Dynamite&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;b&gt;96% of the budget was marketing&lt;/b&gt;. You've probably heard of &lt;i&gt;Napoleon Dynamite&lt;/i&gt;. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you liked it or not…it raked in the cash at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lessons worth learning throughout the book; one of them is one I&amp;#39;ve known for a long time, that science is at odds with popular culture because it is largely an exercise in constant criticism, and people hate being criticized. We encourage a culture of negativity, because it works for us…which means, of course, that I can&amp;#39;t simply let the book slide by with a happy two thumbs up. I &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be such a scientist. One of the things Randy seems to be oblivious to is the fact that character and personality are an essential part of the style element he is endorsing, and scientists can capitalize on their particular, peculiar, aggravating set of common characteristics. He tells his story of being the scientific dufus in the company of artists; the guy who takes things too literally, who has strange stories, who can obsess over odd stuff that no one else cares about, and who has enough character that his friends can talk about &amp;quot;being a Randy&amp;quot; and everyone knows exactly what they&amp;#39;re talking about. He writes as if this was a problem, and I can sympathize with some of his embarrassing moments…but it was a &lt;i&gt;strength&lt;/i&gt;. He sounds like he was one of the interesting people in his group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I end up feeling a bit torn. He's telling us "Don't be &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a scientist", and it's true that there are many occasions when the scientific attitude can generate unnecessary obstacles to accomplishing our goals. At the same time, though, I want to say "&lt;b&gt;Do&lt;/b&gt; be such a scientist", because it's part of our identity and it makes us stand out as unusual and, like Randy, &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt;, even if it sometimes does make us a bit abrasive. But, you know, some of us revel in our abrasiveness; it's fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's definitely a book worth reading, even if what I'm saying is that a better title would be "Be Conscious of When You Are Being Such a Scientist and Modulate Your Behavior According to the Situation". But then I'm being &lt;i&gt;such&lt;/i&gt; a scientist, and his choice of a title is a bit snappier. Probably more marketable, too.&lt;/p&gt;

on the subject a few weeks ago. I was happy that my fellow SGU guys were interested in the subject, so we had Carrie come on and talk a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation went smoothly. Carrie and I laid out several points, among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the majority of TAM attendees are white males&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all but one speaker was a white male&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few speakers made comments that were upsetting to many women in attendance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also covered the following in response to those points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the majority of the people at TAM are very friendly and accepting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the JREF faces many challenges when booking speakers and is not purposely excluding women&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the speakers in question responded and said they had not meant to insult anyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discussion was friendly and upbeat. We talked a little bit about the TV show &lt;em&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/em&gt;, though Carrie rightfully said she wanted to minimize that as a topic since whether or not it’s sexist isn’t as relevant as other topics. To sum up our viewpoints on it, Carrie had never seen the show, the guys really enjoy the show, and I’ve seen the first 13 episodes and found the sole lead female annoying and insulting. We agreed to disagree about whether it was a good show, and moved on to the more important issue of sexism amongst skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrie and I both took pains to declare that there is no overt, conscious effort to be sexist and exclude women, and that the main hurdle at this point is to eliminate unintended behaviors that might drive away women and minorities, and to focus more on promoting women and minorities who are gaining prominence. I learned later that a few important points were cut out of our interview for time, but the gist seemed to come through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses I’ve received by email and through the SGU forum have been interesting, with a few people thanking us for having a frank discussion about an oft-ignored topic and some others offering more examples of ways they felt the skeptical community as a whole could be improved with greater focus on issues of sex and race. Some emails thanked us for the discussion and disagreed with a few points. And then, unfortunately, some other people responded with ZOMG FEMINAZIS! Basically, the latter group heard the same interview as something resembling this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.stripgenerator.com/2009/08/10/what-some-people-heard/"&gt;&lt;img style="border:none" title="What Some People Heard" src="http://static.stripgenerator.com/generated/skepchick/strip/2009/08/10/what-some-people-heard_embed.png" alt="Also, your favorite TV show sucks!"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Okay, not the abortion part.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people wrote in suggesting that the topic wasn’t worthy of discussion, and that Carrie and I exaggerated the problems. Many of the responses showed that on the contrary, we underestimated the problem and were downright wrong to say that the only sexism in the community is unintentional. Here are some highlights from the mailbag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mike in Orangevale, CA via email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the August 4th episode, and your guest was Carey from Skepchicks that was talking about the Big Bang Theory show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Carrie was talking about sexism. She mentioned a few clips she had seen at TAM of the Big Bang Theory and then asked that we discuss more important topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping ahead a bit (bolding mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean  is it surprising that attractive girls might be steered toward a path that is less than academic as they go through middle and high school? &lt;strong&gt;I rarely see really attractive women that are also highly intelligent or geeky&lt;/strong&gt; and i dont think its a result of some kind of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF? First of all, who said that all or most geeky women are or should be “really attractive?” Who cares? The point of our discussion was that we should focus on helping women feel comfortable in the skeptical community, not that we should . . . I don’t even know what Mike is saying here, actually. Is he saying that it’s rare for an attractive person to be smart, and therefore a TV show shouldn’t have a smart attractive person on? Someone call the producers of Bones, House, Fringe, Dollhouse . . . ah, screw it. Here’s how Mike wraps it all up, bolding mine again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And did i hear right that the attendance at TAM for women was 40%!,&lt;strong&gt; i mean what do you want?&lt;/strong&gt; i don’t understand what your guest is talking about saying that subjects and events like TAM are oppressive to women when you have half the TAM audience women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, bitches, what more do you want? You should totally be happy with being half the TAM audience! Which is now 40%! 40% is half, really, it is! Even though you pointed out that the actual percentage was closer to 30%. It’s still pretty much half! Look at this pie chart I made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:346px"&gt;&lt;img title="mans &amp;amp; womans" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/mans.jpg" alt="50/50!" width="336" height="176"&gt;&lt;p&gt;50/50!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yeah, we never said TAM is “oppressive to women.” But why get bogged down with the facts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that Mike is just a one-off, you’re wrong. Gary from Albuquerque wrote in to disagree with everything we ever said, including (bolding mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie lamented the fact that there aren’t enough women in the skeptical movement. Actually, when you consider the total population, there aren’t enough PEOPLE in the skeptical movement. &lt;strong&gt;And to be honest, most women that I know are more like the blonde character in Big Bang&lt;/strong&gt;, and along with many men, are too busy living their lives to be interested in science, skepticality, or even current events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; women and &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; men just aren’t interested in what we’re selling, and that’s why mostly men are at the conferences and why all but one speaker at TAM were men. Because women just don’t like science, guys! Case closed. Oh, you wanted scientific evidence that shows women just don’t like science? Gary prefers to base his assumptions on the people he assumes he knows, thankyouverymuch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s turn to the SGU forum for a few more disagreeing skeptics, like “BertrandBataille,” &lt;a href="http://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,21834.msg525861.html#msg525861"&gt;who writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly? It just felt like you were whining about stuff that, at the end of the day, doesn’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in response to our reporting of incidents that upset many women at the conference. Why do their feelings just not matter? Hey ladies, are you running to hang out with skeptics yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites on the SGU forum is user “Hanes.” At first it was tough to pick out just one gem of awesome from the veritable Tiffany’s he has erected, but then &lt;a href="http://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,21834.msg525654.html#msg525654"&gt;he posted this&lt;/a&gt; (bolding mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anyway, my point is:  fuck you&lt;/strong&gt;.  Fuck you, because I can tell you every single male at that conference would have enjoyed their time just as much if not more if their gender had been in the minority.  No group wants more women in skepticism more than men, and you claiming that there’s a quiet, insidious sexism at work only betrays some hidden persecution complex you harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in response to me correcting him on a strawman argument he built, saying that I called Kari Byron the “best example of women in the media” and then posting a picture of her nearly naked in some attempt to show that Kari isn’t worthy of being considered an intelligent, wonderful person since she’s actually a filthy slut, or something? I’m not sure as his “arguments” make no sense. He, like too many listeners, apparently, seems stuck on the minor point that I don’t like his favorite TV show, and that I feel the first season of it does a disservice to women by making the lone female main character a complete idiot. For that, I have a “persecution complex.” Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forumite “KarenX” does an admirable job of pointing out Hanes’ inanities, including an enlightening exchange in which he maintains that of course he wants more women in the community. She asks why. His response? &lt;a href="http://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,21834.msg525686.html#msg525686"&gt;To fuck them, of course&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would I want more women at a skeptic meetup?  Well, the reason is twofold.  First is the obvious one, which you have undoubtably guessed already.  I wish to meet more people of like mind and unlike gender, such that I may begin a life-partnership with one of them and perhaps one day create a young version of us, be it daughter or son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should have understood that when he said “fuck you” to me, he meant it as a romantic overture. Me and my silly girl brain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! There’s another reason he wants more ladies around, and not just because of their quivering ova just waiting to meet his skeptical seed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have noticed, when men are left to their own devices, a “locker room” atmosphere tends to develop.  Women are a moderating influence on this;  men, in the presence of women, are less likely to say, “and she is hot” and more likely to engage in conversation on the ideas presented by the female in discussion.  This may be in a subconscious attempt to not offend or impress the females present, but intentions are irrelivent for my purposes.  I hate locker rooms.  Most nerds do.  Bring on the enlightening discussion; women are a great help at doing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! So it turns out that after all that bluster, he actually agrees with what we said? That maybe, just maybe, a bunch of dudes all together in one place might unknowingly create an atmosphere that makes women feel unwelcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, but when KarenX calls him on it, he clarifies that that’s not sexism. Calling that sexism would be “rediculous” [sic]. Darn. We were so close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Hanes goes on to call me a sexist due to the Skepchick/Skepdude calendars and the fact that I have flirted with people. I responded to encourage him and others to discuss that because I’m just as accountable as anyone, and I think there’s certainly a case to be made that I’ve done or said some sexist things in my time. I figure, if this is the way they learn how to examine behaviors with a feminist eye, then all the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it that feminists are so often misrepresented as being too sensitive, when cases like this clearly show the opposite? Neither Carrie nor I ever told anyone “fuck you.” We never called anyone a sexist. We never lost our temper and we gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, assuming or accepting clarifications that an insult wasn’t intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only the same could be said for those who took offense to our discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I throw this all back to you in the Skepchick community. What did you think of the interview? Were Carrie and I off-base? Is the backlash obscuring legitimate critiques?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, the standards for posting here are a bit higher than on the SGU forum, so please try to avoid the Hanes-like approach to public discourse or else you may end up banninated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250001167762"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2723">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd1f45999a86609c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autism Omnibus: Cedillo appeal denied</title><published>2009-08-11T09:00:26Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T09:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/Ougn_eL4rOU/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1250001167762"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a66b9163a67e871f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients</title><published>2009-08-10T18:24:29Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T18:24:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are in the news at the moment.  There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting the Pittilo report.

Ana remains in the top ten, but is near the bottom of that list owing to cheaters working for the other contestants, I can only assume.  I mean, how else would she not be on top?  So, go in and vote!  Vote! Vote!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary that you &lt;a href="http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/photos/view/3339/sort:Photo.created"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt; and vote for Ana by giving her &lt;strong&gt;Five&lt;/strong&gt; Stars (below the photo).  Please do this right now, and again tomorrow.  Don't vote for any of the other contestants.

&lt;p&gt;I've known Ana for nearly as long as I've lived in Minnesota, and I can vouch for her many talents. She is an accomplished stage and movie actress and model.  She is also an excellent photographer, quite a good singer, and a diligent political activist, fine artist, and dog lover.  

&lt;p&gt;Ana took a large role in documenting the police actions at the Democratic National Convention one year ago, and more recently, donated hundreds of hours of her time working with a non-profit overseeing the Franken Senate Race recount.  She is one of the Quiche Moraine team as well.  I count Ana as one of my best friends evah.  Tomorrow, I'll be driving around town from coffee shop to coffee shop ... well, checking my email and stuff. If you catch my drift.  

&lt;p&gt;Ana is currently in the top ten females in the contest, and if she remains there she'll have a chance. &lt;a href="http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/photos/view/3339/sort:Photo.created"&gt;Please vote now, every vote counts&lt;/a&gt;.  If you don't vote for Ana, don't come back here because you are not my friend, OK????   &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/this_is_the_last_day_to_vote_f.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/PHQM7O8taYg" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249999155097"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=950">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5a69ddb1fdd87b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Legal issue/Regulation"/><category term="libel"/><category term="simon singh"/><title type="html">Simon Singh Libel Case Update</title><published>2009-08-11T13:18:17Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T13:18:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=950" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just received the following e-mail from Sense About Science regarding the British Chiropractic Association’s libel suit against Simon Singh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Legal Update BCA v Singh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Simon Singh announced today that he will continue the fight in his libel case with the British Chiropractic Association after his application to appeal the preliminary ruling was rejected last week. He has now has the option to try and overturn that decision at an oral appeal. If this fails his case will be tried on a meaning of a phrase he did not intend and is indefensible. This highlights the problem of narrow defences that, along with high costs and wide jurisdiction, make the English libel laws so restrictive to free speech. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Simon said today: “I can confirm today that I have applied for a hearing to ask the Court of Appeal to reconsider its recent denial of permission.  A great deal has happened since my original article was published back in April 2008 and I suspect that the libel case will continue for many more months (or maybe years). While my case is ongoing, it continues to raise a whole series of arguably more important issues, particularly the appalling state of English libel laws. I am pleased that the Culture Secretary has agreed to meet with signatories of the Keep Libel Laws out of Science campaign statement to hear how the laws affect writers. We are also pursuing a meeting at the Ministry of Justice and with front benchers in other departments to lobby for a change in the law.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorgeous, isn’t it? Drawn by artist Gregory Siegburg, it’s part of a new project called &lt;a href="http://www.experiencetheplanets.com/"&gt;Experience the Planets&lt;/a&gt;, started by a talented group of artists who want to create and collect beautiful artwork of the planets so that people can get a view of them that — so far — are difficult to obtain or cannot be achieved with our probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures they have there are incredible, and available for download as wallpaper, too. My only complaint is that they don’t have enough! But they’re looking for more artists, so if you have the talent, you might want to contact them.

You know it's legit, because it has "Museum" in the title.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is a photojournal of my experience, from beginning to end. The photos are generally less crappy than my TAM7 photos because I'm finally getting a handle on my new camera. There aren't really any group pictures or anything because the group was fairly diffuse and by the time there would have been an opportunity to get a shot of lots of atheists, I had a godawful headache. My pictures are almost exclusively of the actual stupid stuff at the museum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us, then, begin at the beginning...&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEeLOSiDRI/AAAAAAAAAuk/DhaeFXHoxNY/s1600-h/DSCF0601.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="It&amp;#39;s sad that they had a real mastodon fossil up there." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEeLOSiDRI/AAAAAAAAAuk/DhaeFXHoxNY/s400/DSCF0601.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This information was underneath a mastodon skeleton at the very entrance to the museum. Herein they tacitly admit that species to change over time, but they couch it in baraminology by talking about elephant "kind," whatever a "kind" is. We'll see later on that they aren't really sure quite how to differentiate "kinds." Also take note that the Pleistocene apparently took place "a few centuries" after Noah's flood. This will come back later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEfwQMhOAI/AAAAAAAAAus/1RLtGZuRwQY/s1600-h/DSCF0606.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="It can&amp;#39;t see you if you don&amp;#39;t move!" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEfwQMhOAI/AAAAAAAAAus/1RLtGZuRwQY/s400/DSCF0606.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a baby T-rex from the very beginning of the museum. It has, I am not making this up, &lt;i&gt;molars&lt;/i&gt;. The Fiancee was quite put out by this. It really is pretty silly. Next to the baby T-rex was his friend, whom he would never eat if even he had the teeth to do so, a little girl:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEgy8K1ygI/AAAAAAAAAu0/YPdP5GJuTwA/s1600-h/DSCF0605.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="Fucking uncanny valley." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEgy8K1ygI/AAAAAAAAAu0/YPdP5GJuTwA/s400/DSCF0605.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This thing was &lt;i&gt;creepy as hell&lt;/i&gt;. It moved jerkily like the ghosts in that remake of &lt;i&gt;House on Haunted Hill&lt;/i&gt; and it would occasionally stop and look you in the eye with a gaze that seemed to say "I would swallow your soul, but I can't loose myself from Ken Ham's blessed moorings." It, and its friend the molar-having baby T-rex, were also really crappy animatronics. I remember better animatronic dinosaurs at museums when I was &lt;i&gt;ten&lt;/i&gt;. They spared no expense on the creep factor, but they took it out of the "Moves in more than two directions" budget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEh_igIPHI/AAAAAAAAAu8/XlP7t1_7Hlo/s1600-h/DSCF0608.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:300px;height:400px" title="&amp;#39;C&amp;#39; is for &amp;#39;consummation;&amp;#39; that&amp;#39;s good enough for me." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEh_igIPHI/AAAAAAAAAu8/XlP7t1_7Hlo/s400/DSCF0608.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Across from Miss Creeptastic and Flumpy the Vegan Tyrannosaur was this. Apart from being a silly oversimplification (don't want nobody to be thinkin' &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; durn much) likely created by an undergrad marketing major from Liberty University, it made me think how convenient it is that the seven "pivotal events" they chose to represent the entirety of human history can all be represented in English by words that start with the letter "C." In order, they refer to the Genesis myth, Adam and Eve's fall, the flood, the Tower of Babel and the scattering of world languages, the birth of Jesus, the death of Jesus, and the apocalypse. Apparently the rest of the Bible is more or less expendable. Odd, that; I'd think they'd shoehorn in an eighth "C" to cover the one part of Leviticus they care about. Maybe "Care not about fags" or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They made a big deal about the many languages in which they offered audio tours, but apparently they didn't think that their cutesy little "7 C's" deal wouldn't translate into those languages as anything other than a plain ol' list. That thought got me wondering what seven letters would begin each word in the list in Hebrew and ancient Greek. Knowing Hebrew, probably not quite as cutesy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEkcpFKc3I/AAAAAAAAAvE/dvj_wYkEz5Y/s1600-h/DSCF0609.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="The date here is important." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEkcpFKc3I/AAAAAAAAAvE/dvj_wYkEz5Y/s400/DSCF0609.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is one of the first of many panels showing the difference between "God's Word" and "Human Reason," a topic to which we will return in due time. This one is especially important because, in concert with the mastodon panel above, it allows us to calculate Ken Ham's idea of when the Ice Age occurred: about 2000 BC. Among the things known to have happened around 2000 BC are the completion of Stonehenge after about 1500 years of off-and-on construction, the foundation Minoan civilization in Crete, and the beginning of Egypt's &lt;i&gt;twelfth fucking dynasty&lt;/i&gt;. That's the Middle Kingdom, folks; Egyptians, apparently, didn't notice the glaciers that very rapidly descended upon their northern trade partners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the pharaohs of the sixth dynasty also didn't notice the global flood that killed them and their entire culture about 300 years earlier. Those Egyptians. So oblivious, always with their heads in the clouds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoErE1jDvvI/AAAAAAAAAvM/arPJ1oTNkg4/s1600-h/DSCF0611.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="I don&amp;#39;t think they understand quite how long &amp;#39;billions of years&amp;#39; really is." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoErE1jDvvI/AAAAAAAAAvM/arPJ1oTNkg4/s400/DSCF0611.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here we have a fine example of the bare assertion fallacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEr2qNRc9I/AAAAAAAAAvU/E4nqpcofn1Q/s1600-h/DSCF0612.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="The frogs were cute as hell, though." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEr2qNRc9I/AAAAAAAAAvU/E4nqpcofn1Q/s400/DSCF0612.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A fine experiment that usefully proves their point. For the sake of rigor, though, I suggest they replicate it. With spitting cobras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the evening and the morning were the first section. And I said that it was very, very bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEsYp5tTuI/AAAAAAAAAvc/l8HYEdtX4mk/s1600-h/DSCF0613.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="They don&amp;#39;t have tags on them!

Playing in the background was a video of some quack paleontologist talking about his in &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; view, dinosaur fossils are evidence that supports the Bible. Which is his starting assumption. Hooray, science!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was the beginning of the theme for the second section: "Creation scientists" come to different conclusions than real scientists not because they're ignorant charlatans, but because the two groups simply have "different starting assumptions." This shows up on nearly every piece in this section of the museum. Around the next corner, they decide to define, for the sake of clarification, what they mean:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEtrvg2dSI/AAAAAAAAAvs/ucehkp4CWRU/s1600-h/DSCF0615.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="What a crock." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEtrvg2dSI/AAAAAAAAAvs/ucehkp4CWRU/s400/DSCF0615.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEtrKDkYrI/AAAAAAAAAvk/qkQ1LUliJo4/s1600-h/DSCF0618.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="Pot, meet kettle." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEtrKDkYrI/AAAAAAAAAvk/qkQ1LUliJo4/s400/DSCF0618.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we have here is the death-knell to their claims that they're just doing science. When you have to reject any and all "speculations" (don't you love the frame-job, too?) that contradict the Bible, you're just plain not doing science. You're masturbating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also redefine the process of science as some sort of philosophical exercise, a kind of reasoning in a vacuum. In their accounting of "human reason," they completely leave out the role of actually &lt;i&gt;looking for evidence&lt;/i&gt;, making it seem like anyone who engages in non-Biblical science is simply navel-gazing and making stuff up as he goes along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second paragraph (in the second picture) is a damn laugh riot. All holy texts but the Bible are "arbitrary," as is any other basis for fact. While I would argue that if one holy book is arbitrary, all holy books are arbitrary (after all, they all claim to be true), the corollary to this statement would seem to be something like "Philosophies that use God's Word as a starting point are prone to misinterpret the facts because their starting point is fixed, and therefore they're rigidly dogmatic and completely unable to change their minds should new evidence arise."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEvk8u-P0I/AAAAAAAAAv0/SZxytpLaEkY/s1600-h/DSCF0616.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:300px;height:400px" title="Sorry it&amp;#39;s blurry and diagonal." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEvk8u-P0I/AAAAAAAAAv0/SZxytpLaEkY/s400/DSCF0616.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I took this one because it nicely illustrates the way they're intentionally framing everything for the mooks that come in thinking they're learning real information. Here we have the scientific view of history, from the Big Bang onwards, and &lt;i&gt;every single stage in the formation of the universe&lt;/i&gt; is called "evolution."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us never again wonder why people go about claiming that evolution can't explain the origins of matter and energy as if that was a valid criticism of the theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEwOh1vz5I/AAAAAAAAAv8/S8FJRdh87fA/s1600-h/DSCF0617.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="Apparently the triceratops was the prototypical dinosaur." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoEwOh1vz5I/AAAAAAAAAv8/S8FJRdh87fA/s400/DSCF0617.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Remember when they said that billions of years wasn't enough to get the current level of biodiversity out of a single-celled ancestor? Apparently a couple of hundred is enough to get every single dinosaur from a single "dinosaur kind," and a few thousand is enough to get every single fungus from a single "mushroom kind."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's funny about their baraminology model of "microevolution" is that it requires exponentially faster change than good old &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; evolution. A single "kind" of butterfly had to differentiate itself into thousands of different species, all over the world, in the space of a couple of millennia. How is this a &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; model than Darwinian gradualism? How, if they accept this as true, do they have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; grounds whatsoever so dismiss the theory of evolution as impossible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This picture also shows how confused their "kind" designation is. Apparently butterflies are one "kind," instead of, say, all insects, but &lt;i&gt;all dinosaurs&lt;/i&gt; comprise a separate and unified "kind." Amoronsayswhat?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE1vkNxMyI/AAAAAAAAAwE/_gNsmYSRcyU/s1600-h/DSCF0619.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="What about on day 7, when God smoked a bowl?" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE1vkNxMyI/AAAAAAAAAwE/_gNsmYSRcyU/s400/DSCF0619.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I took this picture to highlight the way they use dinosaurs in every possible place to get kids excited about being lied to. "Kids like dinosaurs, right? Let's lure 'em in with that and then tell them all sorts of crazy shit!" Like this picture illustrates, dinosaurs were popping up in places where they weren't what you'd call strictly necessary, or even useful, just as a patronizing eye-catcher for kids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE2qVu8piI/AAAAAAAAAwM/a6aNrPGoal0/s1600-h/DSCF0621.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="It really is quite funny." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE2qVu8piI/AAAAAAAAAwM/a6aNrPGoal0/s400/DSCF0621.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here, Magus laughs at a funeral that was meant to make him sad.

It's odd; they're not looking at each other's word bubbles, so how do they know what the other is saying?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and, kid in the red jacket?

To take the picture, I asked someone standing in front of it "Excuse me, could you move back so I can get a good picture of this particular bullshit?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, seriously, &lt;i&gt;everything on this panel is a lie.&lt;/i&gt; The Bible has &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; consistent message, especially Old Testament to New Testament, and is riddled with contradictions, hence the necessity of the &lt;i&gt;entire endeavor of apologetics.&lt;/i&gt; I don't know what the hell scrolls they're talking about, but  I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; know that the Dead Sea Scrolls confirm that there was a whole lot more that could have ended up in there that didn't. The archaeology claim is laughable; archaeology has falsified the Flood, the existence of Jewish slaves in Egypt, and has aided in our understanding of the world as far older than 6000 years (just to name a few). Hell, writing itself is older than 6000 years. And which prophecies have been fulfilled? The ones in Part I that someone shoehorned scenes in Part II to fit? Sorry; I wasn't spiritually impressed when Anakin Skywalker fulfilled the Jedi prophecy, and I'm not spiritually impressed when your fiction matches its earlier parts. Hooray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE6RBWZ90I/AAAAAAAAAwk/RTmnHrittss/s1600-h/DSCF0623.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="They&amp;#39;re all wearing dresses, too." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE6RBWZ90I/AAAAAAAAAwk/RTmnHrittss/s400/DSCF0623.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here they're just cribbing from "History of the World Part I."

Isaiah there on the left looks an &lt;i&gt;awful&lt;/i&gt; lot like Osama bin Laden. Him or Saruman the White. Either way, he's surely up to no good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE7TrGUMMI/AAAAAAAAAw0/F7iQc38fK-U/s1600-h/DSCF0627.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="It&amp;#39;s so simple!" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE7TrGUMMI/AAAAAAAAAw0/F7iQc38fK-U/s400/DSCF0627.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Here they forgot the word "eventually." And they always fail to juxtapose this with the fact (later flogged for all it's worth) that one of Adam's descendants, Methuselah, lived for over 900 years. Yeah, you'll die, but you'll do all right before that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These next four pictures are claims made for how archaeology backs up the Bible. The short answer to all of them is "There is history in the Bible. That does not make the Bible history. There is history in &lt;i&gt;War and Peace&lt;/i&gt;, too." I will, however, comment on each individually to the best of my knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8hlMYnOI/AAAAAAAAAw8/BGKmc4osEQU/s1600-h/DSCF0628.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8hlMYnOI/AAAAAAAAAw8/BGKmc4osEQU/s400/DSCF0628.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Did archaeologists ever consider this an error? For a long time, Near Eastern archaeology used the Bible as a fucking &lt;i&gt;guidebook&lt;/i&gt; until it became clear it wasn't really that useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8h1MVSaI/AAAAAAAAAxE/J843lYWR60c/s1600-h/DSCF0629.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8h1MVSaI/AAAAAAAAAxE/J843lYWR60c/s400/DSCF0629.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Good Lord, where to start? Again, I see no reason to believe that anyone thought writing hadn't been invented at the time. The Code of Hammurabi, written in cuneiform, is hardly the first piece of writing we have. The origins of the written word, like I said before, go back &lt;i&gt;before the 6000-year mark the creationists give for the age of the Earth&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, it would seem like &lt;i&gt;Hammurabi&lt;/i&gt; wrote the law, not Moses. Bad choice of example, friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you connect the bottom of the above picture with the top of the bottom one you'll see that the discovery of Sargon the Great is also seen as a vindication of the Biblical account. What they don't tell you is far more interesting. According to their bullshit chronology, Sargon conquered and united Mesopotamia &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_BC"&gt;before, during, and after the Great Flood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Bit of an oversight, that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8ieHZaUI/AAAAAAAAAxM/cPARumAfKug/s1600-h/DSCF0630.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8ieHZaUI/AAAAAAAAAxM/cPARumAfKug/s400/DSCF0630.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So? What's that got to do with the truth of the rest of the Bible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8itZrCwI/AAAAAAAAAxU/3UYpn80Ea30/s1600-h/DSCF0631.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoE8itZrCwI/AAAAAAAAAxU/3UYpn80Ea30/s400/DSCF0631.JPG" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Doesn't that mean it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; in secular records?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And look there at the bottom bit that got cut off. "Literally hundreds?" Really, now. That would take more panels than this weak little effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is all like that "Science Confirms the Bible" nonsense. Even if it &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; true, finding that some part of the Bible refers to actual people, places, or events does not render the entire thing an accurate historical document.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFIAKv5siI/AAAAAAAAAxc/1vghni4z2vk/s1600-h/DSCF0635.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="God, I hate this guy." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFIAKv5siI/AAAAAAAAAxc/1vghni4z2vk/s400/DSCF0635.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This bit was part of a timeline showing how "human reason" has done nothing but bring people further and further from God throughout history. This one was particularly nonsensical because the entire First Meditation (from which the famous "Cogito, ergo sum" is drawn) rests on Descartes' stone-cold certainty that God exists and is the provider of all things. In a way, the First Meditation is one long and very elaborate proof of God's existence. Epic Philosophical Phail, Creation Museum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFJPsLwj2I/AAAAAAAAAxk/yZMztBLfHgU/s1600-h/DSCF0638.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="All inner cities look like this." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFJPsLwj2I/AAAAAAAAAxk/yZMztBLfHgU/s400/DSCF0638.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This was the start of the fourth section. It was like a movie studio backlot where they film "ghetto" scenes for cop dramas. The whole thing was made to look like a damaged, crime-ridden inner city, and the predominant message was "This is what life is like without the Bible." They have apparently never been to Scandinavia, nor have they looked at actual statistics for the rate of Christianity in the inner city. Somehow, I doubt that places like this are full of atheists, given that atheists make up only 1% of the prison population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFKYdj2hJI/AAAAAAAAAxs/hiVPJqSVogc/s1600-h/DSCF0640.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="This is MY United States of Whatever!" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFKYdj2hJI/AAAAAAAAAxs/hiVPJqSVogc/s400/DSCF0640.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFKyBEJBzI/AAAAAAAAAx0/OOnD5RGNUuw/s1600-h/DSCF0641.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="And there was much rejoicing." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFKyBEJBzI/AAAAAAAAAx0/OOnD5RGNUuw/s400/DSCF0641.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If these stats are to be believed, they are heartening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFLW7H9BaI/AAAAAAAAAx8/2u14j4XVS8E/s1600-h/DSCF0643.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="Will they never tire of this one?" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFLW7H9BaI/AAAAAAAAAx8/2u14j4XVS8E/s400/DSCF0643.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yeah, they really are. Well, except for that blind spot. And night blindness. And the whole designed-backwards thing. And macular degeneration. And astigmatism.

What a cunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFPhCnOmLI/AAAAAAAAAy0/BBqy4SBsKvg/s1600-h/DSCF0662.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" title="This guy is about to eat Samuel L.

This raptor, at about eight feet long, proves without doubt that they attended the &lt;i&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/i&gt; school of paleontology. Raptors were &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor"&gt;only about a meter long at best&lt;/a&gt;, and they were likely feathered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFQTQNIIgI/AAAAAAAAAy8/Ec7actjlRm4/s1600-h/DSCF0663.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFQTQNIIgI/AAAAAAAAAy8/Ec7actjlRm4/s400/DSCF0663.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This panel was one of many surrounding the giant raptor and containing vast amounts of bullshit. Venom used to not be venom? The potential for venom was always there but didn't show up until Adam ate the fruit? If Adam "corrupted" God's creation and fucked up his divine plan, why did God build these lethal contingencies into his formerly peaceful animals? This is pure ridiculousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFRZRUAF6I/AAAAAAAAAzE/WPlfwiPcEm8/s1600-h/DSCF0666.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFRZRUAF6I/AAAAAAAAAzE/WPlfwiPcEm8/s400/DSCF0666.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This panel exists only to reinforce misconceptions about evolutionary theory. The sheer dishonesty of it is appalling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFRwUCZ6wI/AAAAAAAAAzM/42QTMgev-cQ/s1600-h/DSCF0674.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFRwUCZ6wI/AAAAAAAAAzM/42QTMgev-cQ/s400/DSCF0674.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This was a little scale model of Noah the sociopath ignoring the rocks full of people (Ancient Egyptians, maybe) crying for help as they were being eaten by tigers (no kidding). After all, God said they were evil. They must deserve to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFSLFOWL9I/AAAAAAAAAzU/GX8AvXaatfc/s1600-h/DSCF0675.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFSLFOWL9I/AAAAAAAAAzU/GX8AvXaatfc/s400/DSCF0675.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They're right; it's not. It's only part of the puzzle. How this is an argument against evolution I have no idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFSjhSPPwI/AAAAAAAAAzc/Bm9_k2OT76A/s1600-h/DSCF0684.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFSjhSPPwI/AAAAAAAAAzc/Bm9_k2OT76A/s400/DSCF0684.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a reconstruction (more or less) of the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. I just had to take this picture because, while the Ishtar Gate itself was a later addition, Babylon was built and inhabited during the entire time the Near East was supposed to be covered in glaciers. Oops...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFTJdqgxXI/AAAAAAAAAzk/8GyoPvzSYII/s1600-h/DSCF0687.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SoFTJdqgxXI/AAAAAAAAAzk/8GyoPvzSYII/s400/DSCF0687.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And, finally, just outside the last section of the museum, is the famous triceratops with a saddle on it. Here Magus in joyous exclamation at the amazingness of the triceratops with a saddle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After that, who can stay an unbeliever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah: every SSA member that walked through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/actionskeptic/sets/72157622007992340/"&gt;my Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; for most of the pictures I took. I'll be adding to it over the next few days, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were other oddities that I didn't get good pictures of that are worth mentioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A mannequin of Paul of Tarsus writing one of his epistles in what appeared to me to be nonsense Greek (I snapped a picture of his missive for later translation to see if I'm right).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A partial reconstruction of Noah's ark filled with crappy animatronic workers speaking in bad Russian accents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- An animatronic Methuselah who sat in a dark room and talked about how old he was. He sounded a whole lot like Yoda, in voice &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; content: "For 963 years have I walked this Earth," and so on. "For 800 years have I trained Hebrews. My own council will I take on who is ready."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A panel describing how antibiotic resistant bacteria do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; provide evidence of evolution because they can't survive in other contexts where non-resistant bacteria can. People sat around this one for a while, talking incredulously. Even if it was true, and we had no reason to believe it was, it was still in support of evolution because the resistant bacteria evolved to fill its antibiotic-filled ecological niche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A facade of the outside of a house with three windows "open" to video screens showing the "terrible" things going on in middle America without the Bible: a kid listening to music while his friend played Xbox, a family having dinner, and a couple having coffee. WTF?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A white room where there were no words or displays, just a constant video loop projecting onto the walls. It's content? The rise of Nazi Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Many, many posters and panels listing the different Hebrew words used for "God" or "Lord," each one conspicuously ignoring the fact that "Elohim" is plural and of indeterminate gender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A panel claiming that "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercane"&gt;hypercanes&lt;/a&gt;" are real things and not esoteric hypotheticals. It also claimed that the Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a hypercane. It is not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A map showing the land and sea routes that the various animals took from Mt. Ararat to their current locations on the globe. Someone asked "But how did anything get to Australia?" The answer was on the next panel: giant rafts made of debris from the flood connected all of the world's landmasses. Of course!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A text-filled panel on a wall that went to great lengths to defend the Biblical practice of incest. After all, who else would Adam's kids marry? And it was okay because mutation (defined as "damage to the genome") wasn't rampant until many years &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the fall, so their kids wouldn't have birth defects, which is really the only reason you shouldn't go bone your sister right now. It was very creepy and weird and entirely unnecessary. If they had left the incest thing unsaid, most people probably wouldn't have even brought it up. But then they would have missed out on making the panel's final point: fags and dykes who want to get married have no right to judge Biblical incest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A petting zoo with a pair of zorses (zebra/horse crossbreeds) bred solely to prove the "point" that "kinds" can interbreed past the "false" species designation of modern science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except zorses are sterile. Like ligers and mules. But that's not important, and neither is the fact that a housecat cannot interbreed with a cheetah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the corollary is that people who defend Biblical incest have no right to judge gays who want to get married. They left that part out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, the experience was kind of surreal. There were many people there &lt;i&gt;in earnest&lt;/i&gt;, including the douchebag pastor who promised to be there to "confront" us, who instead was pretty much a bitch. The place was like entering a different world, where different physical laws applied and everyone was tripping balls all the time. It was hard to mock; its very existence kind of mocked itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of the staff members were polite to a &lt;i&gt;fault&lt;/i&gt; to us. They even called us by name (thanks to our little SSA nametags), which I found kind of creepy. I think they were instructed to be even nicer than normal to us, at least until someone decided &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/expelled_from_the_creation_mus.php"&gt;to boot a guy out for no apparent reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When that happened, I was in the gift shop with Magus, The Fiancee, some members of Purdue's Non-Theists Society, and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/"&gt;Hemant Mehta&lt;/a&gt; looking at the hundreds of books of total nonsense on sale. There was a book supposedly on logical fallacies that, at one point, insisted that "the reason so many people believe in an afterlife is because it actually exists." Yeah, about that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in the middle of reading an apologist's bullshit take on Egyptology (short summary: if we assume that the Egyptians meant "Jews" when they said "Asiatics," and if we assume that their own meticulously recorded history was, in actuality, centuries off, then we have evidence that Jews were enslaved in Egypt, which reminds me of Homer Simpson saying "If by 'no,' you mean 'yes...'") when Hemant, reading his Twitter feed, sighed loudly and said "&lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt; just Twittered that a guy with a video camera got kicked out."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it turned out, the "guy with the video camera" was the ABC news correspondent sent to cover our visit. Good call, Creation Museum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stupid thing about it all is that chances are good that I was being louder and more disruptive in the gift shop than the poor guy who got booted. They just needed an "example," but really it just proved how pathetic they are and how they won't even stick by their word as we stuck by ours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who does PR for these guys? Seriously? A retarded toddler?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can only say two nice things about the "Museum." Firstly, the grounds are beautiful. But that's really nothing that the "Museum" did. Secondly, the food was pretty good and reasonably-priced for that sort of attraction. Usually at a place like that, the food is crappy and twenty bucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, we got some really great evil eyes from quite a few people. Apparently the Mennonites who chose that day to show were none too happy with our presence, and one kept glaring at us while we ate lunch. I was in too much headache pain to notice. I'm honestly kind of surprised that one or more of the mullet-clad hillbillies wandering the place didn't try to start a fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, if truth be know, I'm kind of disappointed, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good riddance, Creation "Museum." May your joists rot and your roof collapse in on your Hallowed Halls of Bullshit. I will not be going back. I have seen the enemy, and he is really, really lame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-8798786308747414522?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249995449838"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=765">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bbdd6fe89808d9f9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="end-of-life care"/><title type="html">End-of-Life Decision Making</title><published>2009-08-11T12:29:47Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T12:29:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=765" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Much attention is being paid recently to the culture of medicine in America. Health care reform is triggering a much needed (although certainly not new) discussion about many aspects of health care, trying to find solutions to a very complex problem, and even just trying to define the problem. One small aspect of this broad discussion, one part of the culture of medicine in America, is the conflict between patient choice and cost-effective medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a strong advocate of patient choice – long gone are the paternalistic days of doctors dictating care to passive patients or their surrogates. But part of the problem with rising health care costs is the culture of medicine – from the doctor and patient side. And therefore any attempts at making medicine more cost effective are going to require a change in that culture. I believe the preferred method is through education of best practices, but expectations may need to be altered as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conflict between choice and standards is perhaps most emotional when it comes to end-of-life decisions, but this may also be where significant savings can be made without compromising quality of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context I want to focus on are those situations when a loved-one has had a catastrophic event – heart attack, stroke, or severe trauma, that has left them severely brain injured. And I only want to consider the end of the spectrum where the patient has no or an insignificant chance of surviving, and if they do survive they are guaranteed to be significantly impaired (not able to live independently, or walk and talk again).  And further I only want to consider older adults (not children or adults &amp;lt; around 70).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past in such a situation the Marcus Welby paternalistic doctor might have come to the family and explained how grave the situation is, and then say that there is nothing that they could do, so come say your goodbyes and we will make sure your loved-one is completely comfortable. Of course, 50 years ago there really wasn’t much they could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have the technology to keep people alive for a long time with heroic and expensive interventions, and this technology is advancing all the time. Recently a new technique of chilling a patient after a heart attack has become standard as it improves long term outcome, albeit modestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time that our technology has advanced and given us more choices, those choices have shifted to the family, who may or may not be prepared to make that decision. The health care team can educate the family as to the situation and the options, and we generally do a good job of that. But the greatest challenge is the emotional one. Many family members do not want to feel guilty about letting their parent or other loved-one die, and there may be disagreements among family members about what is the right thing to do and who gets to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news169120074.html"&gt;A recent study &lt;/a&gt;found that slightly less than half of so-called surrogates in this situation do not want recommendations from the physicians.Why that is needs to be further explored – it likely has much to do with trust, but there are likely cultural issues. In any case, many surrogates may be going it alone when they are making perhaps the most emotional decision of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, in my experience, most families are very reasonable and deal with this situation surprisingly well. But occasionally things do not go well – there is no clear surrogate, no clear advanced directives from the patient, or the family does not seem to trust the system, or one individual simply cannot let go. When this occurs the result can be days, weeks, even months of futile and very expensive care. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of futile care may be spent on a single case without any hope of a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the cases for which we need to find solutions. This is not only pure waste, such situations are emotionally devastating to the families. One might also question the ethics of performing heroic and invasive procedures on a patient without any reasonable hope of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can look for ways and take steps to prevent these situations from developing – encouraging advanced directives is one option that seems to help. Older adults seem to be more comfortable with the closeness of their mortality on average than their children – and so physicians can encourage their older patient not only to have advanced directive but to talk to their children about their wishes. One conversation in which “mom said she would not want to live like this” can solve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when all efforts to prevent these impasses fail, then how should we respond. Right now the family has all the power – that is the balance that our society has opted for. If the cost of health care were not an issue, then this balance would be reasonable, but it is an issue. It is so much of an issue that we are rationing health care and talking about how to further ration it. So those hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on futile care affect everyone by raising the cost of the whole health care system. It may therefore be worthwhile to explore ways to resolve impasses regarding futile care in a fair, objective, and compassionate way. And such measures should only be considered in extreme cases when care is truly futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should at least pick the low-hanging fruit. All that is required is the political will. But that is likely to be a difficult if not insurmountable hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

Ben Stein, that old fraud, was recently fired from his gig as a columnist for the New York Times because he crossed an ethical line: he was shilling for one of those 'free credit report' scammers. Well, that's what the NYT said, but he has written a long whine in which he carefully explains that what he did wasn't unethical at all, and he was actually &lt;a href="http://spectator.org/archives/2009/08/10/expelled-from-the-new-york-tim/"&gt;fired because he offended a cabal of Goldman-Sachs bankers, Obama supporters, and…neo-Darwinists and atheists&lt;/a&gt;! I think that last bit was a reference to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch him blubber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final thought. Well, maybe two final thoughts: first, it's sad that the Internet has become a backyard gossip freeway for the whole world's sick people to pour out their neuroses. I have seen a tiny fraction of all of the hate mail that's come in the wake of the NY Times announcement (which they promised they would not make in any event). Too many sick people out there on the web for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Second, among those who are not really such hot items, I fully include myself. Without doubt, I have made as many mistakes as a person not in custody can make. I make no claims to anything even remotely like perfection or even desirability as a role model. It is just that in this case, I didn't do anything wrong. In my life, I have done plenty wrong. I am not the master. I am the servant and a poor one at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget "incoherent"! He's also pathetically whiny! There are so many things Ben Stein could apologize for as he says goodbye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/we_made_a_sad_old_man_cry.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ROJmc_-4YHY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249994556831"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1655">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0fe0e622d994041</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Eggcorns"/><category term="Language and the media"/><category term="Language change"/><title type="html">Fry's English Delight: So Wrong It's Right</title><published>2009-08-11T12:31:15Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T12:31:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1655" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stephen Fry — British comedian, quiz show host, and public intellectual — has just started a new series of his BBC Radio 4 program on the English language, &amp;quot;Fry&amp;#39;s English Delight.&amp;quot; In &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lv1k1"&gt;So Wrong It's Right&lt;/a&gt;," Fry "examines how 'wrong' English can become right English." Our old friend the &lt;a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/"&gt;eggcorn&lt;/a&gt; makes an appearance about 11 minutes in. Jeremy Butterfield, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Damp-Squid-English-Language-Laid/dp/0199239061/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Damp Squid: The English Language Laid Bare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, explains eggcorns to Fry (&lt;a href="http://eggcorns.lascribe.net/english/416/squid/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;damp squid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an eggcornization of &lt;em&gt;damp squib&lt;/em&gt;, in case you didn't know). Butterfield also talks about spelling changes, like the back-formation of &lt;em&gt;pea(s)&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;pease&lt;/em&gt;, and how lexicographers use corpora to track changes in language (with specific reference to the Oxford English Corpus, the main subject of &lt;em&gt;A Damp Squid&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

One has written, among mathematical equations, “Then a miracle occurs,” to which his colleague replies, “I think you need to be more specific here in step two.” This nicely sums up the relationship between science and religion: one deals in the natural while the other deals in the supernatural. And never the twain shall meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were only it were so. Unfortunately, religions routinely make claims about the natural world that are in direct conflict with the scientific evidence. Young-Earth Creationists, for example, believe that the world was created around 6,000 years ago, about the same time that the Babylonians invented beer. These claims cannot both be correct, and anyone who thinks the former is right has relegated all of science (along with brains) to the dumpster of life. Many people of faith believe that prayer can cajole the deity into taking action in our world to do everything from healing cancers to winning wars. Yet a comprehensive controlled scientific study on the efficacy of prayer on healing, funded by the religiously-based Templeton Foundation and conducted at the prestigious Harvard Medical School, found no relationship between the two: subjects in the non-prayed for group did just as well (or poor) as those in the prayed for group. And why is it, scientists want to know, that prayer only seems effective for things that might have happened anyway, such as tumors going into remission. A more dramatic and unmistakably religious miracle that would shock even the most skeptical of scientists would be if prayers for amputees (especially our brave wounded Christian soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan) resulted in renewed whole limbs; i.e., a true miracle.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, can we reconcile the natural and the supernatural? Most people keep them separated in logic-tight compartments, even scientists. Surveys conducted in 1916 and again in 1997 found that 40 percent of American scientists said they believe in God. As well, hundreds of millions of practicing Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and members of other faiths both believe in God and fully embrace science, even evolution: a 2005 Pew Research Center poll found that 68 percent of Protestants and 69 percent of Catholics accept the theory. So, demographically speaking, most people find no conflict between science and religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the natural world does not bend to the demographics of belief. Millions of people also believe in astrology, ghosts, angels, ESP, and all manner of paranormal piffle, but that does not make them real. The veracity of a proposition is independent of the number of people who believe it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I go so far as to conclude: &lt;em&gt;There is no such thing as the supernatural or the paranormal. There is only the natural, the normal, and mysteries we have yet to explain&lt;/em&gt;. God is a mystery, and the God of Abraham may very well be an eternal mystery for the simple reason that any God explicable through science and the laws of nature would, by definition, lose the status of supernatural and enter the realm of the natural. A God definable by science is not a God at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There may be more language-related research being done in social psychology than you're aware of.   Attached is a chapter Jen Pardo and I contributed to a book about connections between social psych and other disciplines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see the chapter, which was published a few years ago as Robert M. Krauss and Jennifer S. Pardo, "Speaker Perception and Social Behavior: Bridging Social Psychology and Speech Science", pp. 273-278 in Paul A.M. Van Lange (Ed.), &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mtU4d4T-jeMC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridging Social Psychology: Benefits of Transdisciplinary Approaches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2006. But reading this chapter, and skimming the rest of the book, confirmed my view that at present, there is remarkably little language-based research in the social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Their (persuasive) abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Language plays a critical role in social life, and the semantic-pragmatic levels of linguistic analysis has become an important research  focus in social psychology. Considerably less attention has been paid to the organized sound system that underlies speech.  We distinguish between speech perception, which studies the processes underlying comprehension of the linguistic content of speech, and speaker perception, which examines effects of variability in speech that is not linguistically significant. Much of the latter deals with phenomena that lie at the heart of social psychology.  We describe two broad research areas that illustrate the insights consideration of the phonological level of speech can contribute to an understanding of social behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their (inspiring) conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In this brief essay, we have argued that the sound structure of speech contains information that can contribute importantly to our understanding of social behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Speaker perception studies the way a particular utterance reflects a speaker's identity and internal state, and his/her definition of the situation. The variability that these factors produce can be studied both as a dependent variable and an independent variable. That is to say, we can examine the effects on voice of inductions involving activated identities, internal state or situational definitions; we also can examine how variability in features of voice (either natural or synthetically created) affect listeners' perceptions of the speaker and the semantic content of the utterance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't seen their chapter before, but I know most of the works in their bibliography. And in keeping with the theme of my earlier post, I'll predict that as digital audio archives become more and more available, and computational analysis and synthesis of "voice features" becomes more and more accessible, this kind of work should logically increase in prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, when Bob and I overlapped at Bell Labs 30-odd years ago, if you wanted (for example) to compare the "activated identities" of politicians as revealed in their speeches or press conferences, you'd need to buy audio tapes from media companies, have them physically shipped to you, and then digitize and analyze them using million-dollar minicomputers. ("In the snow, uphill, both ways.") Today you can download the audio for free over the internet,do acoustic analysis and synthesis on your laptop, and run perception experiments over the net as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite Bob's 30-odd years of evangelism from positions of well-deserved authority and respect, and despite the fact that various forms of speech-and-language-based research  are becoming easier and easier, it's still not very common for social psychologists to do the sort of  research that he persuasively recommends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Krauss and Pardo chapter is 5 pages in a &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mtU4d4T-jeMC"&gt;489-page book&lt;/a&gt; focusing broadly on interdisciplinary applications of social psychology — and I was unable to find any other discussion in the book of research based on linguistic analysis of any sort. (&amp;quot;Conversation analysis&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;discourse analysis&amp;quot; are mentioned once each, in a parenthetical and essentially contentless sort of way.) This sampled proportion (5/489 = 1%) strikes me as a plausible estimate for the field as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I predict that this is certain to change, as social-science researchers (and social psychologists in particular) respond to their changing environment. But the cultural conservatism of the academy means that it's going to take a while.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249989873202"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BpsResearchDigest/~3/NxGpflj9-SY/surprising-links-between-anger-and-time.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/078c77191cbfa12c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The surprising links between anger and time perception</title><published>2009-08-11T04:32:08Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T04:32:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BpsResearchDigest/~3/NxGpflj9-SY/surprising-links-between-anger-and-time.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The way we think about abstract concepts like time is grounded in physical metaphors. For example, we talk about re-arranged events being moved from one day to another, as if through space. Similarly, there is a metaphorical, embodied aspect to our emotions - fear is associated with physical withdrawal, for example, whilst anger is associated with approach and confrontation. An intriguing new study shows that this shared way of thinking about time and emotion can lead to some surprising effects.David Hauser and colleagues first showed that people with an angrier temperament are more likely to think of themselves as moving through time, than to think of time as moving towards them. You can test this on yourself by considering which day of the week a meeting has changed to, if it was originally planned for Wednesday but has been moved forward two days. If you think it&amp;#39;s now changed to Friday, then you&amp;#39;re someone who thinks of themselves as moving through time, whilst if you think the meeting is now on Monday, then you&amp;#39;re more passive, and you think about time passing you by.In a second study, Hauser&amp;#39;s team asked student participants a version of this question but they made it so the re-arranged event was either anger-provoking or neutral. On average, more students presented with the angry version said the event had been moved to Friday (as if they themselves were moving through time) than students presented with the neutral version. Moreover, the angry-version students were more likely (than the neutral students) to say that they felt as though they were approaching the event, rather than that the event was approaching them. In other words, it seems that angry thoughts can change the way we think about time.A final study turned this on its head and showed that thinking about moving through time can induce anger. The researchers presented students with a computer screen flat on a desk, facing the ceiling. On it were the days of the week, in a vertical line with Saturday at the top, then Friday, Thursday, all the way down to Sunday at the bottom, nearest the participant. Commands were given that either provoked thoughts about moving through time, away from the participant (e.g. a meeting has moved forward two days from Sunday to Wednesday - please highlight the new day on the screen), or thoughts about time moving towards the participant (e.g. a shift down the screen, towards the participant from Wednesday to Sunday). Participants primed to think about their movement through time subsequently rated themselves as feeling angrier than participants in the &amp;quot;time moving towards them&amp;quot; condition.&amp;quot;These studies support theories of embodied cognition by showing that abstract concepts that share a perceptual domain can influence each other in a novel but predictable manner,&amp;quot; the researchers said._________________________________Hauser, D., Carter, M., &amp;amp; Meier, B.

Palmer claimed to have restored deaf janitor Harvey Lillard’s hearing by manipulating his spine. This makes no anatomical sense, and few if any chiropractors claim to be able to reverse deafness today. But now a chiropractic website is attempting to vindicate D. D. Palmer. They list deafness among &lt;a href="http://www.chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/Conditions.shtml#Deafness"&gt;a long (wrong) list of “Conditions That Respond Well to Chiropractic” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/Deafness.shtml"&gt;They list 6 supporting studies. &lt;/a&gt;Three are case reports, two are case series, and one is a review of the literature that is labeled in its title as “A Search to Validate” D.D. Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study No. 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study is a case report entitled “Hearing Loss, Otalgia and Neck Pain: A Case Report on Long-Term Chiropractic Care That Helped to Improve Quality of Life.” I’ll copy the entire abstract to give a flavor of the quality of evidence these chiropractors find acceptable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To describe symptom reports, multiple chiropractic assessments and adjustments over 7 years with a patient experiencing neck pain and complex ear symptoms consistent with Meniere’s syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical Features: A 43-year-old female, injured years earlier in a motor vehicle collision, suffered recurrent exacerbations of otherwise continuous neck pain. Later she developed aural symptoms of severe otalgia, hearing difficulty, tinnitus and dizziness that increased and decreased in severity with her neck pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intervention and Outcome: The intervention was repeated application of chiropractic adjustments using a modified Pettibon adjusting device. Over 7 years of observation, the subject consistently reported reduction in symptom severity after adjustments, with relief lasting up to 2 months. Consistent with the natural history of Meniere’s syndrome, an overall deterioration was noted during the observation period. Hearing fluctuated in approximate synchrony with changes in angular displacements of upper cervical vertebrae during the treatment period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Observation over an extended period assists in understanding the progression of chronic disorders. This patient experienced substantially reduced symptoms with chiropractic care during the 7-year observation period. Of note is the repeated exacerbation of neck pain that often precedes exacerbation in ear symptoms, along with the relief of both following adjustment and an association between improved hearing and improved cervical alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: This woman’s deafness was part of her Meniere’s disease and was presumably not related in any way to her auto accident or her neck symptoms. The association of reported increases in neck pain with exacerbation of Meniere’s symptoms could be due to the fact that people in pain and people who are in a depressed mood are more likely to report other physical symptoms. Reduction in symptoms after adjustment is compatible with nonspecific effects of any treatment, with placebo response, or with the natural course of illness. Fluctuating hearing loss is one of the characteristics of Meniere’s disease. The Pettibon system is an upper cervical method that is not supported by any credible evidence. The finding of “angular displacements of upper cervical vertebrae” is an upper chiropractic delusion: actual displacements have not been confirmed by conventional radiologists. “Improved cervical alignment” cannot be scientifically demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study No. 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a case report of a 41-year-old woman who had bilateral ear pain, tinnitus, vertigo, “altered or decreased hearing acuity,” and headaches. She had a history of ear infections treated with antibiotics. She had been diagnosed and treated for temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ). The chiropractor diagnosed an atlas subluxation and after 9 treatments her symptoms resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: We don’t know what was wrong with this patient. What does “altered or decreased hearing acuity” mean? Hearing can be temporarily decreased by infections with fluid in the middle ear. TMJ does not cause deafness. Atlas subluxations are mythical. Symptoms like these typically fluctuate and may resolve spontaneously over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study No. 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case report of a 75 yr old woman with longstanding vertigo, tinnitus and hearing loss. Her symptoms increased over a 5-week period before she sought chiropractic care. Her symptoms improved during upper cervical chiropractic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: Symptoms fluctuate over time. The chiropractor saw her when the symptoms were at their worst, and regression to the mean explains why she improved. Did she have Meniere’s disease? A fluctuating hearing loss is characteristic of Meniere’s. Upper cervical chiropractic treatment has never been shown to cure anything. There is no reason to think the treatment had anything to do with her improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study No. 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Improvement in Hearing after Chiropractic Care: A Case Series.” &lt;a href="http://www.chiroandosteo.com/content/pdf/1746-1340-14-2.pdf"&gt;Full text available online &lt;/a&gt;The subjects were a “sample of convenience” of 15 patients who presented for chiropractic care and whose chief complaint was not hearing loss. All subjects were found to have hearing loss, more in the left ear than the right, and after a single chiropractic visit 8 patients improved in one ear, 3 improved in both ears, four were unchanged, and 3 were worse. The post-treatment tests continued to show worse hearing in the left ear than the right. The author indulges in wild speculation about possible mechanisms including brain plasticity and the effect of peripheral stimulation on thalamic activity in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: The discussion section of the report admits that this study can’t prove a cause and effect relationship. To support his speculations, the author references Carrick’s ridiculous blind spot study which I critiqued at length in &lt;em&gt;The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.chirobase.org/06DD/blindspot.html"&gt;briefly on Chirobase&lt;/a&gt;. Just citing Carrick’s article is enough to completely discredit the author in my mind. It is junk science and its conclusions depend on circular reasoning. One thing that particularly bothers me about this study is the finding of more hearing loss on the left side. As far as we know, hearing loss should be evenly distributed. What could account for the discrepancy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study No. 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vertebrogenic Hearing Deficit, the Spine, and Spinal Manipulation Therapy: A Search to Validate the D.D. Palmer/Harvey Lillard Experience.” This review of the medical and chiropractic literature &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggests that hearing deficits may be associated with spinal joint motion restriction, spondyloarthrosis, irritation of the sympathetic nervous system, decreased cervico-cerebral circulation and/or decrease in tinnitus…It is proposed that some cases may benefit from SMT. Further research is needed to determine the role of SMT in the treatment of vertebrogenic hearing deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: The very title indicates bias. This author cherry-picked the literature in a vain attempt to validate D.D. Palmer. While the literature may “suggest” the associations he lists, it does not “prove” those associations, much less show that any association represents a causal relationship. He does not provide any evidence that SMT can restore hearing. He calls for research into the treatment of “vertebrogenic hearing deficits” but that would just be Tooth Fairy science, since we have no evidence that hearing deficits can be due to vertebral causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study No. 6&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chiro.org/research/ABSTRACTS/Cervicogenic_Hearing_Loss.shtml"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Cervicogenic Hearing Loss.”&lt;/a&gt; The author of this case series starts by admitting “there remains a dispute whether a “vertebragenic hearing disorder” exists. This latter disorder is believed accompanied by tinnitus, a feeling of ear pressure, otalgia and deafness as symptoms of a functional deficit of the upper cervical spine.” It studied 259 patients with “well-defined functional deficits of the upper cervical spine and symptoms of cervical vertigo,” and found subjective hearing disorders in 15% and audiometric threshold shifts in 40%. 62 patients with vertebragenic hearing loss improved during chiropractic management. He concludes that the therapy of choice is chiropractic manipulation of the upper cervical spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments: He doesn’t have any evidence that the disorder exists, but he diagnoses it in 62 patients (!?) At best, this is a case series of questionable significance; at worst it is Tooth Fairy science, studying something that probably doesn’t exist. There were no controls. How can he conclude that the treatment of choice is chiropractic manipulation when he has not compared that to any other treatment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere chiropractic apologists have hypothesized how problems in the spine might lead to effects in the ear. The vertebrobasilar artery passes through the neck and a branch of it supplies the inner ear. Conceivably a neck injury could damage the artery and reduce blood supply to the ear, but it is inconceivable that manipulating the neck could then reverse the damage. Some have posited effects via the autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system, but they have not demonstrated that an autonomic problem is present, that it could account for the symptoms, or that autonomic effects could be corrected or compensated for by manipulation. Some argue that sensory stimulation of the body can affect stuff in the brain. Sure, if you hit your toe with a hammer, there will be a change in brain activity. That’s a truism, not an argument for spinal manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rumor (unconfirmed) that Harvey Lillard’s widow later said he was deaf until the day he died. We will never know enough about his case to understand what really happened. But I think we can reasonably conclude that spinal manipulation is not an effective treatment for hearing loss. And that the authors of this website have no understanding of what constitutes credible scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Naturally: it’s where we stash presents and stuff that we don’t need right away. Now and then I think of  a new hiding place (behind a pile of crap that he’d never think to look behind; under the kitchen sink) and I am momentarily happy. The whatever-it-is (bag of pretzels, wrapped gift) is safe from prying hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/raccoon.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of Arrr! (flickr.com)" width="500" height="358"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of Arrr! (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But daily our closets are under assault. “Alex, get out of my closet!” is a frequent scream. “Get AWAY from  there!” It’s not always intriguing toys — sometimes it’s a box of family photos or Elmo videos we couldn’t stand any longer. For a few difficult months when Alex was little, he could not keep his hands off my underwear drawer. He pawed through the entire contents saying, “Black? Black?” or sometimes “Black t-shirt?” He was searching for silky black things to finger as he fell asleep. We solved this by buying him his own silky black t-shirt. I think we even cut it into smaller pieces so there were several and he never had to do without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the closets. Anything is fair game, in his eyes. A box of discarded toys for the yard sale? Not discarded by Alex, is his opinion. Books we’d like to donate? Alex thinks he’d like another look at them. The only thing that doesn’t interest him is clothes — possibly because he thinks we might try to make him wear something non-khaki or possibly printed or maybe even with buttons down the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my current strategy is to assemble a bunch of stuff I don’t want — toys, books, bric-a-brac — on the bottom of  a carton of shopping bag. Top with generous serving of old clothes and voila. Guaranteed not to attract pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This came as quite a shock to a lot of biologists I spoke to at the time. A lot of them couldn’t understand how it have happened. Some decided to get together to plan what to do in response. With lightning-fast reflexes, a meeting was arranged over a year later. Representatives from major scientific societies gathered to make a plan. They invited a number of other people to join them. I was one. And, frankly, I felt like I was observing a meeting of representatives of tribes from some New Guinea highland forest, who were following rules and speaking a language that I could not begin to understand. At the end of the meeting, these dozens of scientists made a momentous decision. They would…wait for it…go back to their societies and suggest that they post on their web site a statement that evolution is good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there, gob-smacked, wondering exactly how many people actually visit, say, the American Phytopathological Society. And yet everyone at the meeting seemed so happy, so excited that they had really done &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;–that they had let the public know just where they stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience was a stunning lesson for me about what scientists think is effective communication. And while some of that spirit still survives today, a lot has changed–at least based on my highly non-scientific intuition. Many scientists have been thinking about what they can do in their interactions with the media to get a better sense of their science across. Many, fed up with what they consider to be a sadly broken media machine, have taken matters into their own hands with blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three books are coming out this year directed at these scientists. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future&lt;/a&gt;, by my fellow Discobloggers Sheril Kirshenbaum and Chris Mooney, was the first. I talked to Chris about the book in this &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/11/bloggingheads-robot-superbowls-oversized-electrons-and-other-thoughts-with-chris-mooney/"&gt;Bloggingheads talk&lt;/a&gt;. Cornelia Dean of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is publishing another, called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674036352?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0674036352"&gt;Am I Making Myself Clear?: A Scientist’s Guide to Talking to the Public&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a lean, straightforward tour of the media landscape, led by a journalist who has written about science for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third is by a scientists–but it’s called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597265632?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1597265632"&gt;Don’t Be Such a Scientist: Talking Substance in an Age of Style&lt;/a&gt;. The author is Randy Olson, a biologist who headed to Hollywood. Back in 2006, I &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2006/02/14/movie-night/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about his documentary, &lt;em&gt;Flock of Dodos&lt;/em&gt;–which was his own response to the events in Kansas. Rather than post a statement on a web site, Olson made a funny movie that not only demonstrated the flim-flammery of creationists, but also showed how dismally evolutionary biologists communicated to those beyond their guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, Olson draws on his own experience making movies to offer some advice to his fellow scientists on how to tell their story, and to get that story heard. Olson doesn’t want scientists to stop being scientists, but he does urge them to pay more attention to what they say and how they can say it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By now you may be thinking, “What’s this guy got against intellectuals? He’s calling them brainiacs and eggheads.” Well, I spent six wonderful years at Harvard University completing my doctorate, and I’ll take the intellectuals any day. But still, it would be nice if they could just take a little bit of the edge off their more extreme characteristics. It’s like asking football players not to wear their cleats in the house. You’re not asking them not to be football players, only to use their specific skills in the right place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above figure illustrates the sensory homunculus, where each body part is placed onto the region of cortex that represents it, and the size of the body part is proportional to its cortical representation (and sensitivity). It's rare to see the genitals represented at all. And if they are present, they are inevitably male genitals. To remedy this puritanical and androcentric situation, Swiss scientists at University Hospital in Zurich conducted a highly stimulating study in 15 healthy women to map the somatosensory representation of the clitoris (Michels et al., 2009).The authors begin by reviewing the work of Wilder Penfield et al.:During the last 70 years the description of the sensory homunculus has been virtually a standard reference for various somatotopical studies (Penfield and Boldrey 1937;  PDF). This map consists of a detailed description of the functional cortical representation of different body parts obtained via electrical stimulation during open brain surgery. In their findings they relied on reported sensations of different body parts after electrical stimulation of the cortex. Assessment of the exact location was generally difficult and sometimes led to conflicting results. The genital region was especially hard to assess due to difficulties with sense of shame.Recent studies have tried to map the somatosensory represenation of the human penis using neuroimaging methods, but there has been disagreement over whether it shows the classic medial representation seen in the figure above, or a more laterally located representation in the postcentral gyrus. For example,  Kell et al. (2005) noted that......classical and [some] modern findings appear to be at odds with the principle of somatotopy, often assigning it to the cortex on the mesial wall. Using functional neuroimaging, we established a mediolateral sequence of somatosensory foot, penis, and lower abdominal wall representation on the contralateral postcentral gyrus in primary sensory cortex and a bilateral secondary somatosensory representation in the parietal operculum.But there are no comparable fMRI studies of female genitalia. So how is such a study conducted, methodologically speaking? Electrical stimulation of the dorsal clitoral nerve was compared to electrical stimulation of the hallux (big toe). It was all very clinical, no sexual arousal involved. Here's the experimental protocol:Prior to the imaging session, two self-attaching surface disc electrodes (1 × 1 cm) were placed bilaterally next to the clitoris of the subjects so that we were able to stimulate the fibers of the dorsal clitoral nerve. Before the start of the experiment, electrical test stimulation was performed to ensure that subjects could feel the stimulation directly at the clitoris. In addition, the strength of electrical stimulation was adjusted to a subject-specific level, i.e. that stimulation was neither felt [as] painful nor elicited – in case of clitoris stimulation – any sexual arousal (see below). Functional imaging was performed in a block design with alternating rest and stimulation conditions, starting with a rest condition. ...  In addition to the clitoris stimulation, we performed in eight of the recorded subjects a second experimental session, in which we applied electrical stimulation of the right hallux using the same type of electrodes, stimulation and scan paradigm.If you "see below" in the Methods you'll discover that after the fMRI session, participants rated their level of sexual arousal and discomfort on a visual analogue scale that ranged from -10 (unbearable pain or strong sexual arousal) to 10 (pleasure or no arousal at all/sleepiness). The median score for sexual arousal was zero with some variability [range: −7.5 to 8; −2 (25% percentile) and 2.5 (75% percentile)]. The median score for comfortableness was −2 [range: −7 to 9; −2.5 (25% percentile) and 0 (75% percentile)]. C'est la vie.The neuroimaging results revealed that compared to the rest blocks,Electrical clitoral stimulation produced significant activations predominantly in bilaterally prefrontal areas (BA 6, 8 and 45), the precentral, parietal and postcentral gyri, including S1 (BA 2 and 3; 40–70% probability) and S2 (BA 43 and ventral BA 40, 30–60% probability). In addition, distributed activations were also seen in the anterior and posterior parts of the insula and the putamen.Fig. 3 (Michels et al., 2009). Illustration of the random-effect group-activation pattern for the contrast ‘electrical clitoral stimulation versus rest’ (orange–yellow color code; p less than 0.02 uncorrected for multiple comparisons) and for the contrast ‘electrical hallux stimulation versus rest’ (green–blue color code; p less than 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons) on a group average brain. A cluster extent threshold of p less than 0.05 is applied for both contrasts. Electrical clitoral stimulation elicited bilateral activations of lateral surface of S1 as indicated by the white circles.The major result was similar to the penile homuculus findings of Kell et al. (2005): a failure to replicate the original 1937 studies of Penfield and Boldrey. Although the statistical thresholds here for the clitoral stimulation were not stringent enough, the authors use this to their advantage:We found no evidence of clitoral representation in the mesial wall, even when using unconventionally low statistical thresholds. This finding is further substantiated by other recent cytoarchitectonic studies revealing that BA 2 does not reach the inter-hemispheric fissure and BA 3 and BA 1 reach the postcentral mesial wall with a probability of only 30% . Our results are also in good agreement with [neuroanatomical] studies on nonhuman primates. In conclusion, it appears that Michels et al. (2009) have indeed mapped out a new clitoral homunculus, to go along with the new penile homunculus. The standard somatosensory images should be revised accordingly....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I mean, i- i- i- if you like the Post Office and the Department of Motor Vehicles, and you think they're run well, just wait till you see Medicare, Medicaid, and health care, done by the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Dylan Matthews at The Treatment ("&lt;a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_treatment/archive/2009/08/04/quot-now-don-t-you-let-the-government-get-a-hold-of-my-medicare-quot.aspx"&gt;Now Don't You Let The Government Get A Hold Of My Medicare&lt;/a&gt;", 8/4/2009) compared this to an earlier example of conservative pandering to public ignorance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;[&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Senator John Breaux] was walking through the New Orleans airport, returning home, when an elderly female constituent approached him. "Senator, Senator," she said, plucking emotionally at his sleeve. "Now don't you let the government get a hold of my Medicare." Breaux, ever the charmer, smiled and said reassuringly of this greatest of government entitlement programs, "Oh, no, we won't let the government touch your Medicare."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Matthews commented, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t believe I have to explain what this says about the Republican economic policy elite&amp;quot; — which is a bit confusing, because John Breaux was a &lt;em&gt;Democratic&lt;/em&gt; senator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramesh Ponnuru at NRO ("&lt;a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Yjk4ZTNmZGU4OGQxYzRhYmI3ZDFmZDAwMDljNDk2YjU="&gt;Re: Hands Off Medicare&lt;/a&gt;", 8/5/2009) compounded the confusion by making an implausible linguistic argument in Laffer's defense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I think this is a simple misunderstanding. Laffer seems to me to be saying that Medicare and Medicaid are not run well, and neither will health care in general when the government expands its role in it. "Done by the government," that is, modifies only "health care," not "Medicare, Medicaid, and health care."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes no syntactic, semantic, rhetorical, or phonetic sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laffer is using a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;start=10&amp;amp;ei=HdqAStHrLZGMtge-1LTICg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=spell&amp;amp;resnum=0&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;q=%22if+you+like+*+just+wait+till+you+see%22&amp;amp;spell=1"&gt;common rhetorical pattern&lt;/a&gt; of the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;If you like X, just wait till you see Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be used straight ("If you like the single, just wait til you see the video") or ironically ("Government: If you like the problems we cause, just wait 'til you see our solutions!") But in either case, the author suggests that X is viewed by many as good (or bad, in the ironic case), and predicts that if you're one of those that share that view, then Y will turn out to be even better (or even worse, in the ironic case). This implies that you're not already familiar with Y, or that Y will change in some way that will affect your evalution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laffer&amp;#39;s statement is clearly an instance of this rhetorical template being used ironically. When he says &amp;quot;If you like X&amp;quot;, for X = &amp;quot;the Post Office and the Department of Motor Vehicles&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;s suggesting that many people view the Post Office and the Department of Motor Vehicles as bad — and indeed these are standard objects of right-wing scorn, disdained as bloated, inefficient and unhelpful bureaucracies. And thus in his next clause, &amp;quot;just wait till you see Y&amp;quot;, for Y = &amp;quot;Medicare, Medicaid, and health care, done by the government&amp;quot;, he&amp;#39;s predicting that Y will turn out to be even worse than those icons of awfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Medicare, Medicaid, and health care already exist, as Laffer's hearers know well. So why is he making a prediction about our future perceptions of their quality? The only sensible construal is that these programs will change their nature when the government takes them over. Which in turn implies the absurd (but apparently widely-held) view that Medicare and Medicaid are not now government programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ponnuru's proposed parse doesn't work phonetically either. If we eliminate punctuation from our transcript of the crucial clause, and annotate pause durations, we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;just wait till you see [0.194]&lt;br&gt;
Medicare Medicaid and health care [0.285]&lt;br&gt;
done by the government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fluent speech, we expect the duration of pauses between words to correlate with the syntactic and semantic importance  of the juncture. On that basis, if we place two pauses within a structure like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[just wait till you see&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ffffff"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;[ Medicare Medicaid&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ffffff"&gt;……&lt;/span&gt;[and health care done by the government]]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we'd expect them to fall after &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medicaid&lt;/em&gt; — which is not what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if the structure were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[just wait till you see&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ffffff"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;[[ Medicare Medicaid and health care]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ffffff"&gt;…. &lt;/span&gt;[done by the government]]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we'd expect the two pauses to occur after &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;health care&lt;/em&gt; — which is exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;#39;s more! The pitch contour is also exactly what we&amp;#39;d expect if [Medicare Medicaid and health care] were a constituent, with [done by the government] as a following modifier — but it makes no sense under Mr. Ponnuru&amp;#39;s prefered construal. Listen again, and look (click on the image for a larger version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LafferMedicare.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LafferMedicare.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I can see three ways to explain this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Dr. Laffer believes that Medicare and Medicaid are not now government programs, and would be changed for the worse if the government took them over. If this is true, he should educate himself, modify his views, and apologize to those that he may have misled. And CNN should be ashamed of itself for giving air time to an "expert" who is so badly informed about the topic he's asked to comment on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Many older Americans have a high opinion of Medicare and Medicaid, believe (counterfactually) that these programs are not now run by the government, and worry about the government "taking them over" and ruining them. Dr. Laffer knows that this belief is preposterously at variance with the truth, but chose to pander to it anyhow. If so, no self-respecting news organization should ever give him a platform again, except perhaps to give him the opportunity to apologize for being a lying weasel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Dr. Laffer because confused, got his clauses tangled up, and by mistake seemed to say something that he didn't believe. If this is true, then he should take the next opportunity to go on national television to clarify his views and apologize to those he may have misled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timothy Noah at Slate takes (2) for granted, which leads him to &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2224350/"&gt;observe&lt;/a&gt; that "If there is a hell for libertarian poseurs, Laffer has secured himself a berth in it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Krugman &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/what-did-laffer-mean/"&gt;comes down&lt;/a&gt; at about 2.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… if he was garbling his words, there was method in his garble. Right now, right-wingers do not, repeat, do not want people to understand that Medicare is the prime example of that dreaded condition, “government-run health care”; because if people understood that, they might think that government-run care is actually pretty good. So we don’t need to worry about what Laffer really meant; what he said was the party line, which is, “don’t let the government get its hands on Medicare.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own impression is that the error bars run from about 1.8 to 2.2. There&amp;#39;s some more evidence from Dr. Laffer&amp;#39;s own mouth: his next statement is &amp;quot;… I mean, the single provider, I think, is a real problem, Judy, …&amp;quot;, which suggests that he is either deeply ignorant or shamelessly deceitful, since no single-provider plan is even remotely under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly I'm shocked (&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005148.html"&gt;shocked!&lt;/a&gt;) that the CNN anchordroid didn't pick up on Laffer's idiocy/dishonesty/gaffe during the broadcast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note, by the way, that &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/hey-mister-postman/"&gt;Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/08/nothing-sucks-worse-than-post-office.html"&gt;Nate Silver&lt;/a&gt; are not convinced that the DMV and the Post Office should be "unquestioned bywords for 'something bad'", and apparently most Americans &lt;a href="http://www.openleft.com/diary/14504/its-not-1994-anymore-or-1984-for-that-matter"&gt;agree with them&lt;/a&gt;, at least as far as the postal service is concerned.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249967242737"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/069649a6d1cab31f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Muslim Demographics</title><published>2009-08-11T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/demographics.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Video presents statistics demonstrating that "Islam will overwhelm Christendom unless Christians recognize the demographic realities and begin reproducing again."</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249964050374"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=1533">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aaccb012fe19db36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Psychology"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="1930s"/><category term="belief"/><category term="college students"/><category term="fortune telling"/><category term="Malinowski"/><category term="psychic"/><category term="research"/><category term="science papers"/><category term="superstition"/><title type="html">Retrospectacle - Belief in Fortune Telling Amongst College Students</title><published>2009-08-11T04:06:47Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T04:06:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/EwKHWDTmJ8c/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/?p=1533"/><summary xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">What is Retrospectacle?

The weekend was full of swimming and biking, but also food.  I didn't eat too many things that were "empty" of nutrients, but I consumed more mass than I'd hoped too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm not doing too badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast:&lt;br&gt;
2 eggs scrambled with a cup of spinach and a couple of pinches of Romano cheese&lt;br&gt;
1/2 cup shredded wheat with 1/4 cup milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little over 300 calories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch:&lt;br&gt;
A "cobb" salad from the hospital: fresh greens, some shredded cheese, boiled chicken breast, tomatoes, bacon bits and a tablespoon of fat free italian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best guess, about 380-420 calories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner: Bad Doctor, Bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A "vivanno" banana-strawberry smoothie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;280 calories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, not too bad so far.  Nutritive content would have been better without the smoothie.  I plan to consume a healthy "second dinner" when I get home around 9:30 or so.  This will likely be a chickpea/spinach curry I made yesterday.  I'm guessing that the serving I have left is about 300 calories, but it's only a guess.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_tmi_update_4.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/gwpbr5OBnVc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249953032199"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/who_are_you_calling_fat_eh.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc9e7fffcefb1ff3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Food"/><title type="html">Who are you calling fat, eh?</title><published>2009-08-11T01:49:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T01:49:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/dVQ34lfRenE/who_are_you_calling_fat_eh.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/who_are_you_calling_fat_eh.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/weight_loss_-_what_works_reall.php" title=""&gt;weight-loss&lt;/a&gt; topic is still going strong in the blogosphere (see that post for links for several initial posts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry's had &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/good-food-bad-food.html" title=""&gt;something related&lt;/a&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see how experts differ on the topic...and the comment threads are enlightening as well. Take-home message: don't trust a "TV dietitian"...or diet advice in your local newspaper or Cosmo....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/weight_loss_-_what_works_reall.php" title=""&gt;know&lt;/a&gt;, my problem has always been the opposite. How to gain weight?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time I managed to put on a few pounds was when I was working at a horse farm back in 1991/92. I was outdoors for about 13 hours a day. I walked many miles each day catching horses on distant pastures to bring them in, then walking them back to let them out again. I helped feed and muck stalls. I caught, groomed, tacked-up and rode a few young, strong, unruly horses every morning. I taught a couple of riding lessons every afternoon (never standing still - always walking or running along, sometimes hopping on a pony to demonstrate, etc.) and more on Saturdays. So, it was a time when I exercised a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also a time when my diet abruptly changed. I just moved to the USA. I had no idea what was what, food-wise. I was also, for the first time in my life, free to make my own food choices. This is also the only time when I ate breakfast regularly - don't cringe: a big bowl of Coco Puffs, Cocoa Pebbles and Coco Crispies with chocolate milk - I needed all that raw energy to operate! Lunch break was short, so it was either some greasy Stouffers microwaveable crap, or a quick run to Burger King. Dinner consisted of enormous quantities of home-made spaghetti or pizza or steak/potatoes (all very yummy) with a big bowl of salad with lots of cheese and dressing, followed by a beer or two. And in-between those meals I constantly grazed from my hidden stash at the barn: chocolate, bananas and Coke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What those few extra pounds were - muscle, fat? - I have no idea. They disappeared as soon as I stopped working there and started grad school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, some people look at my skinny body and think I am weak or unhealthy - oh, how wrong they are! On the other hand, I wonder how many people who look huge are also strong and healthy. Here are some pictures of top athletes, Olympic gold medalists and World Champions, super-fit, super-strong, super-healthy, yet if you saw them in the street you'd think they were obese - am I mistaken?&lt;/p&gt;

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006578" title=""&gt;Long-Term Functional Side-Effects of Stimulants and Sedatives in Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Small invertebrate animals, such as nematodes and fruit flies, are increasingly being used to test candidate drugs both for specific therapeutic purposes and for long-term health effects. Some of the protocols used in these experiments feature such experimental design features as lifelong virginity and very low densities. By contrast, the ability of both fruit flies and nematodes to resist stress is frequently correlated with their longevity and other functional measures, suggesting that low-stress assays are not necessarily the only useful protocol for testing the long-term effects of drugs. Here we report an alternative protocol for fruit fly drug-testing that maximizes reproductive opportunities and other types of interaction, with moderately high population densities. We validate this protocol using two types of experimental tests: 1. We show that this protocol detects previously well-established genetic differences between outbred fruit fly populations. 2. We show that this protocol is able to distinguish among the long-term effects of similar types of drugs within two broad categories, stimulants and tranquilizers. Large-scale fly drug testing can be conducted using mixed-sex high-density cage assays. We find that the commonly-used stimulants caffeine and theobromine differ dramatically in their chronic functional effects, theobromine being more benign. Likewise, we find that two generic pharmaceutical tranquilizers, lithium carbonate and valproic acid, differ dramatically in their chronic effects, lithium being more benign. However, these findings do not necessarily apply to human subjects, and we thus do not recommend the use of any one substance over any other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000170" title=""&gt;Distinct Parietal and Temporal Pathways to the Homologues of Broca's Area in the Monkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two distinct cortical areas in the frontal lobe of the human brain, known as Broca's region, are involved with language production. This region has also been shown to exist in nonhuman primates. In this study, we explored the precise neural connectivity of Broca's region in macaque monkeys using the autoradiographic method to achieve a level of detail impossible in the human brain. We identified two major streams of connections feeding into Broca's area: a ventral stream from the temporal region, which includes areas processing auditory, multisensory, and visual information and a dorsal stream originating from the inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent superior temporal sulcus. Our detailed connectivity analysis illuminates the pathways via which posterior cortical areas can interact functionally with Broca's region, in addition to contributing to an understanding of the evolution of language. We suggest that a fundamental function of Broca's region is to retrieve information in a controlled strategic way from posterior cortical regions and to translate this information into action. This fundamental function was adapted during evolution of the left hemisphere of the human brain to serve language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006582" title=""&gt;Motor Properties of Peripersonal Space in Humans&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A stimulus approaching the body requires fast processing and appropriate motor reactions. In monkeys, fronto-parietal networks are involved both in integrating multisensory information within a limited space surrounding the body (i.e. peripersonal space, PPS) and in action planning and execution, suggesting an overlap between sensory representations of space and motor representations of action. In the present study we investigate whether these overlapping representations also exist in the human brain. We recorded from hand muscles motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by single-pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) after presenting an auditory stimulus either near the hand or in far space. MEPs recorded 50 ms after the near-sound onset were enhanced compared to MEPs evoked after far sounds. This near-far modulation faded at longer inter-stimulus intervals, and reversed completely for MEPs recorded 300 ms after the sound onset. At that time point, higher motor excitability was associated with far sounds. Such auditory modulation of hand motor representation was specific to a hand-centred, and not a body-centred reference frame. This pattern of corticospinal modulation highlights the relation between space and time in the PPS representation: an early facilitation for near stimuli may reflect immediate motor preparation, whereas, at later time intervals, motor preparation relates to distant stimuli potentially approaching the body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006587" title=""&gt;Adaptive Lévy Walks in Foraging Fallow Deer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lévy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. Lévy walks maximise search efficiency of mobile foragers. Recently, several studies raised some concerns about the reliability of the statistical analysis used in previous analyses. Further, it is unclear whether Lévy walks represent adaptive strategies or emergent properties determined by the interaction between foragers and resource distribution. Thus two fundamental questions still need to be addressed: the presence of Lévy walks in the wild and whether or not they represent a form of adaptive behaviour. We studied 235 paths of solitary and clustered (i.e. foraging in group) fallow deer (Dama dama), exploiting the same pasture. We used maximum likelihood estimation for discriminating between a power-tailed distribution and the exponential alternative and rank/frequency plots to discriminate between Lévy walks and composite Brownian walks. We showed that solitary deer perform Lévy searches, while clustered animals did not adopt that strategy. Our demonstration of the presence of Lévy walks is, at our knowledge, the first available which adopts up-to-date statistical methodologies in a terrestrial mammal. Comparing solitary and clustered deer, we concluded that the Lévy walks of solitary deer represent an adaptation maximising encounter rates with forage resources and not an epiphenomenon induced by a peculiar food distribution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000086" title=""&gt;Can We Systematically Review Studies That Evaluate Complex Interventions?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The UK Medical Research Council defines complex interventions as those comprising "a number of separate elements which seem essential to the proper functioning of the interventions although the 'active ingredient' of the intervention that is effective is difficult to specify." A typical example is specialist care on a stroke unit, which involves a wide range of health professionals delivering a variety of treatments. Michelle Campbell and colleagues have argued that there are "specific difficulties in defining, developing, documenting, and reproducing complex interventions that are subject to more variation than a drug" [10]. These difficulties are one of the reasons why it is challenging for researchers to systematically review complex interventions and synthesize data from separate studies. This PLoS Medicine Debate considers the challenges facing systematic reviewers and suggests several ways of addressing them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000120" title=""&gt;Schizophrenia and Violence: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Schizophrenia is a lifelong, severe psychotic condition. One in 100 people will have at least one episode of schizophrenia during their lifetime. Symptoms include delusions (for example, patients believe that someone is plotting against them) and hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there). In men, schizophrenia usually starts in the late teens or early 20s; women tend to develop schizophrenia a little later. The causes of schizophrenia include genetic predisposition, obstetric complications, illegal drug use (substance abuse), and experiencing traumatic life events. The condition can be treated with a combination of antipsychotic drugs and supportive therapy; hospitalization may be necessary in very serious cases to prevent self harm. Many people with schizophrenia improve sufficiently after treatment to lead satisfying lives although some patients need lifelong support and supervision.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000123" title=""&gt;Cross-National Analysis of the Associations among Mental Disorders and Suicidal Behavior: Findings from the WHO World Mental Health Surveys&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. Every 40 seconds, someone somewhere commits suicide. Over a year, this adds up to about 1 million self-inflicted deaths. In the USA, for example, where suicide is the 11th leading cause of death, more than 30,000 people commit suicide every year. The figures for nonfatal suicidal behavior (suicidal thoughts or ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts) are even more shocking. Globally, suicide attempts, for example, are estimated to be 20 times as frequent as completed suicides. Risk factors for nonfatal suicidal behaviors and for suicide include depression and other mental disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, stressful life events, a family history of suicide, and having a friend or relative commit suicide. Importantly, nonfatal suicidal behaviors are powerful predictors of subsequent suicide deaths so individuals who talk about killing themselves must always be taken seriously and given as much help as possible by friends, relatives, and mental-health professionals.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_50.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/CzBJkVn4DQ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249951502414"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=14523">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c1adebd5b6eaac7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Art"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Atheism in “Raisin in the Sun”</title><published>2009-08-11T00:00:10Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T00:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/10/atheism-in-raisin-in-the-sun/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember reading &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt;’s “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679755330?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0679755330"&gt;Raisin in the Sun&lt;/a&gt;” the summer before I entered high school.  Which means I read it before I became an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why the following passage didn’t stick out in my mind (video below) back then.  A reader brought it to my attention recently, though, and I’m just in awe of it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mama&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Kindly)&lt;/em&gt;: ‘Course you going to be a doctor, honey, God willing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beneatha&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Drily)&lt;/em&gt;: God hasn’t got a thing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mama&lt;/strong&gt;: Beneatha — that just wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beneatha&lt;/strong&gt;: Well — neither is God.  I get sick of hearing about God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mama&lt;/strong&gt;: Beneatha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beneatha&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean it!  I’m just tired of hearing about God all the time.  What has He got to do with anything?  Does He pay tuition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mama&lt;/strong&gt;: You ’bout to get your fresh little jaw slapped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s just what she needs, all right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beneatha&lt;/strong&gt;: Why?  Why can’t I say what I want to around here, like everybody else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mama&lt;/strong&gt;: It don’t sound nice for a young girl to say things like that — you wasn’t brought up that way.  Me and your father went to trouble to get you and Brother to church every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beneatha&lt;/strong&gt;: Mama, you don’t understand.  It’s all a matter of ideas, and God is just one idea I don’t accept.  It’s not important.  I am not going out and be immoral or commit crimes because I don’t believe in God.  I don’t even think about it.  It’s just that I get tired of Him getting credit for all the things the human race achieves through its own stubborn effort.  There simple is no blasted God — there is only man and it is &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; who makes miracles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(MAMA absorbs this speech, studies her daughter and rises slowly and crosses to BENEATHA and slaps her powerfully across the face.  After, there is only silence and the daughter drops her eyes from her mother’s face, and MAMA is very tall before her)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mama&lt;/strong&gt;: Now — you say after me, in my mother’s house there is still God.  &lt;em&gt;(There is a long pause and BENEATHA stares at the floor wordlessly.  MAMA repeats the phrase with precision and cool emotion)&lt;/em&gt;  In my mother’s house there is still God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beneatha&lt;/strong&gt;: In my mother’s house there is still God.  &lt;em&gt;(A long pause)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/T5fo1mbumYA%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure the slap is what Jesus would’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I shouldn’t be so surprised to see this sort of dialogue, especially in a play about African-Americans.  Though the play debuted in 1959, there’s a proud legacy of &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/10/09/interview-with-mike-estes/"&gt;Humanism in black America&lt;/a&gt; in the early part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;br&gt;

Their emails, which I’ve noted here before, are almost always full of bull which annoys me, but today’s, whilst low on the quackery, made me laugh very hard indeed. It was headed “Unbeatable Value”, and if they’re talking about giggles then they certainly provided that, given the email cost me nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it was 996 words. Yep, a sales email that runs to nearly 1000 words. That’s a small essay in any universe except, perhaps, that of the quackery-loving detoxers who run the spa. I won’t print the whole thing because it’s tedious, but I have grabbed a few of my favourite bits for your amusement. All spelling, punctuation and stupidity is exactly as the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine taking 30 minutes out each week, or, if you’re busy every other week, to relax and unwind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a question, because it has a question mark. But what’s the answer? Also, what’s the question? I did a double giggle at this one because the missing comma after ‘busy’ renders the second half of the sentence nonsense. If I was only busy every other week I’d have bigger problems than a back rub could cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seriously imagine now how much better you would feel if you took 30 minutes out on a regular basis to enjoy a massage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, I’m seriously imagining it. Ever so seriously. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you feel happier? Would you feel better able to cope? Would you have more patience? Would you energy levels improve? Would you make better decisions because your mind was more focused? Would your body look and feel more toned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. No. Nope. No. Hell no. Definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re probably now thinking yes, that would be amazing but i don’t have the time or the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. Sorry, I must have meant yes. Probably. But wait! Here comes the science bit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howver, if you’re working 40 hours each week then a 30 minute massage once a week would equate to 1.6% of your working week. Is that really too much to ask? If you come once a fortnight than that is ony 0.6% of your working week, and if the worse comes to the worse and you can only spare a visit once every 4 weeks then that equates to 0.3% of your working time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.6% of my working week sounds a hell of a lot. This is already the worst sales-pitch-backed-up-by-dubious-stats. But what about the cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the cost if your salary is £25k per annum then a monthly massage is going to cost you less than 1.5% of your earnings! not much now is it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh the stupid. It HURTS. We’re in a recession, and apparently 1.5% of your earnings is not much (now-is it-no-question- mark). 1.5% of your earnings is not much for food, yes. Massage backed up by dubious claims of a better life, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time therefore thatwe want to make you an irristible offer on massage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mmm irristible. So irristible thatwe cn’t rsist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said right at the top, this may not be for you, but if it does, act quickly because there are only 12 packages available and we are mailing out to over 6000 clients!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it does what? What? I can’t stand the suspense! I am delighted to learn that another 5999 people are laughing at them, though. Delightfully, the email was signed off “Angel Blessings!”, a nod to the name of the spa and perhaps some sort of confirmation that the owners are into in more areas of BS than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t print the rest, it’s babble. I had three choices today. I could have ignored the email. I could, as a professional marketing genius, have emailed with a very nice, constructive response and my business number. Or I could have laughed my head off at their chakra-realigning ignorance, sent the following reply, then blogged about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I don’t think I’ve ever received such a badly-written, misspelled, poorly-constructed sales email as that. You are to be congratulated.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to receive a reply, which simply said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Tracy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angel blessings!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, it wasn't just &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; at the horrible little creationist theme park — there were over 300 of us! In this blog entry, I intend to collect &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; stories about the zerg in Kentucky. &lt;a href="mailto:pzmyers@gmail.com?subject=CreoZerg!"&gt;E-mail links to me&lt;/a&gt; and I'll add them to this list.

&lt;p&gt;Le Café Witteveen &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/ssa-and-pz-myers-visit-to-creation-museum-creozerg/"&gt;confirms what I've said about it&lt;/a&gt;: no biology, and well-behaved atheists. He also has a &lt;a href="http://cafewitteveen.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/photos-from-the-creation-museum/"&gt;photo collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati Man also &lt;a href="http://thecincinnatiman.com/2009/08/tcms-trip-to-the-creation-museum/"&gt;took lots of pictures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen has &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-1.html"&gt;two summaries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-2.html"&gt;up already&lt;/a&gt;. She also has a &lt;a href="http://www.zazzle.com/blaghag"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt; — buy swag with PZ vs. Ham art!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now added: &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-3.html"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;! And &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-4.html"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-5.html"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-6.html"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-7.html"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-8.html"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/08/creation-museum-part-9.html"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;! I think the &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/07/i-made-it.html"&gt;blogathon&lt;/a&gt; has permanently warped her brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://thomas2026.wordpress.com/"&gt;Christian minister has several comments&lt;/a&gt; — he&amp;#39;s critical of the &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot;, but he&amp;#39;s also critical of the atheists (in which he is wrong — Sean Faircloth&amp;#39;s talk at the SSA meeting was superb.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pensive Corner &lt;a href="http://darkshrowds.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/the-"&gt;reviews some of the very silly displays&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark &lt;a href="http://theinternetstopshere.blogspot.com/2009/08/walking-tour-of-creation-museum-part-i.html"&gt;obviously&lt;/a&gt; got a &lt;a href="http://theinternetstopshere.blogspot.com/2009/08/walking-tour-of-creation-museum-part-ii.html"&gt;laugh&lt;/a&gt; out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ruffington Post &lt;a href="http://www.ruffingtonpost.com/2009/08/pz-myers-and-hemant-mehta-at-creation.html"&gt;captured both Hemant and me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freethought Fort Wayne sent a &lt;a href="http://freethoughtfortwayne.org/2009/08/08/creation-museum-field-trip/"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://freethoughtfortwayne.org/2009/08/07/lolcreashuns/"&gt;representatives&lt;/a&gt; on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may have noticed a small odd green and white blob on the nose of the saddled triceratops. That was a &lt;a href="http://evodevo-mike.blogspot.com/2009/08/i-have-faced-demons-of-idiocy-and-have.html"&gt;little birdie placed there by Evo-Devo Mike's son Alexander&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Laden &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/the_creozerg_visit_to_the_crea.php#more"&gt;collects a few links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will of the People &lt;a href="http://dachte.livejournal.com/639658.html"&gt;summarizes the whole conference, as well as the "museum" trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AiG claims the continents rearranged themselves during the Flood year. Here's a &lt;a href="http://darkshrowds.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/creation-math-the-flood-and-reforming-of-the-earth/"&gt;little math to show how crazy that idea is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "museum" is &lt;a href="http://creationmuseum.wordpress.com/"&gt;full of dogmatic presuppositions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berlzebub &lt;a href="http://berlzebub.blogspot.com/2009/08/what-i-learned-at-creation-mausoleum.html"&gt;learned a few things at the mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. I missed Nessie in the pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute. &lt;a href="http://pastoraaron.info/2009/08/11/scarlet-a-for-a-day/"&gt;This fellow in our group is a Christian&lt;/a&gt;. Weren't we supposed to stone him or something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t just look — at least &lt;a href="http://davenichols.net/creation-museum-visit-believer-atheist-discussion"&gt;one person had a conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip has already &lt;a href="http://wagthegonzo.blogspot.com/2009/08/strategic-battle-lines-were-drawn-and.html"&gt;entered legend as the journey of the 300&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="http://creationmuseum.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/creation-museum-on-martin-luther-and-charles-templeton/"&gt;learned a few interesting things about Martin Luther and Charles Templeton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the &lt;a href="http://jthewonderllama.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/13/"&gt;Flintstones Museum&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/08/prepare-to-believe.html"&gt;"Creepy as hell"&lt;/a&gt; is a good description of the animatronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people &lt;a href="http://pnrj.xanga.com/709441435/what-i-learned-from-the-creation-museum/"&gt;learned things at the "museum"&lt;/a&gt;. Alas for Ken Ham, they weren't what he intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people &lt;a href="http://my-nerdspot.blogspot.com/2009/08/we-came-we-saw-we-laughed-our-asses-off.html"&gt;brought their children into that den of ignorance&lt;/a&gt;. It was OK, though, since it inspired some rational discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://theobligatescientist.blogspot.com/search/label/creation%20%22museum%22"&gt;Obligate Scientist has several posts on the museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/12/what-i-learned-at-the-creation-museum-and-the-secular-student-alliance-conference/"&gt;Hemant has a round-up of his impressions&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a sampling of the &lt;i&gt;offensive&lt;/i&gt; t-shirts people were wearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you turned something from the visit into art? I'll put it here. (My pose atop the dino seems to have caught a little attention here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flickr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people had lots of cameras, and the images are being dumped onto Flickr right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People and their new-fangled video cameras…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Epic Poetry!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A visit from PZ"&lt;br&gt;by Rich Stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a Professor from Morris&lt;br&gt;who gathered the cast and the chorus.&lt;br&gt;And we all headed down&lt;br&gt;to visit the clowns&lt;br&gt;and the bibleists that all abhor us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As day broke, sunny and grand,&lt;br&gt;the heathens from all o'er the land&lt;br&gt;north, east, west and south&lt;br&gt;all by different routes,&lt;br&gt;for reason we'd take a firm stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Kentucky we all did flock.&lt;br&gt;Racing so we'd beat the clock&lt;br&gt;so if we were inclined&lt;br&gt;we might head up the line&lt;br&gt;so we could be the first to mock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With ticket and button in hand&lt;br&gt;we followed through with our plan:&lt;br&gt;for ourselves to see&lt;br&gt;the insanity&lt;br&gt;of Ken Ham's folly first hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as we walked in the door:&lt;br&gt;Behold! A large pterasaur!&lt;br&gt;Graceful and free -&lt;br&gt;or not.

&lt;p&gt;Sheril told the inspiring (and funny) story of how she went from being an expert on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_cucumber"&gt;sea cucumber&lt;/a&gt;, to a pop radio DJ, to a Capitol Hill staffer and &lt;a href="http://www.seagrant.noaa.gov/knauss/"&gt;Knauss Fellow&lt;/a&gt;, to a blogger and author on science with a specialty in the subject of kissing. Inevitably, Sheril related, her trajectory away from academia and towards the worlds of media and policy forced her to communicate with people–fisherman, congressional aides, her senator–who tended to treat scientists as though they were “from another planet.” Traditional scientific language wasn’t the way to reach these folks; a new way had to be found. In particular, Sheril learned that talking about the economic aspects of marine science and fisheries issues helped spark much more interest from the senator she was working for–Bill Nelson of Florida–than a presentation full of p values and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her talk, the point Sheril wanted to drive home to the class–comprised of science grad students at Scripps–was to dare to take a nontraditional career path. The solution to the problems we face are necessarily going to come from many different kinds of people–and scientist-policy wonk-communicator hybrid personalities have a unique leg up not only when it comes to succeeding in communication, but also in the job market at a time when not all young scientists can count on landing academic careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we heard from Tom Bowman, a professional communicator and designer whose background originally was in informal science learning (creating content for museums, aquariums) but has increasingly shifted to communicating about issues at the intersection of science and policy, like climate change. In his talk, Bowman started out by asking a critical question: Sure, we all say science communication is important, but “&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; are we communicating?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific organizations often act as though they don’t have a clear answer to this question. Take the subject of ocean health, for instance; or climate change and the reports of the IPCC; or any scientific topic where many, many blue ribbon committees have sounded off. It turns out, Bowman said, that big science assessment reports are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; written “with the objective of helping you figure out what the most important issues are”–what to care about as a citizen. What really matters. Rather, they are data dumps, attempts to assess the state of knowledge, but hardly made usable or accessible to nonscientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly need to make these products more accessible, but as Bowman asked, what are our goals in doing so? Are they: Changing civic behavior? Changing consumer behavior? Improving scientific literacy? Fulfilling some institutional mission?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we’re not clear about this, scientific communication won’t “succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowman also addressed another issue–how to convey a complex body of data. “People simplify,” he observed. “It is an inherent aspect of human cognition.” The problem is, scientists often want to tell you everything they know. And indeed, scientific communication in journals actually requires being comprehensive. But this makes such science content almost entirely incommunicable to anyone other than scientists. The trick is that we have to speak to people in the language &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; understand, not in the language we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot more other valuable stuff from Bowman’s talk (it was very popular), but I’ll just put up this post–it is more than enough food for thought, and for reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249948591134"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/overt_reader_love.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/14bcd2c133f96561</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ass Shaking Jams"/><title type="html">Overt Reader Love...</title><published>2009-08-10T23:29:15Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T23:29:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/hKuSzAXtA9Q/overt_reader_love.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/overt_reader_love.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little love for my reader who I chatted with today and who referenced The Beatles...&lt;/p&gt;

However, the press coverage and discussion of a recent paper on the subject was weirder still. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For those of you not familiar with this period in Earth’s history, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum"&gt;PETM&lt;/a&gt; is a very singular event in the Cenozoic (last 65 million years). It was the largest and most abrupt perturbation to the carbon cycle over that whole period, defined by an absolutely huge negative isotope spike (&amp;gt; 3 permil in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C). Although there are smaller analogs later in the Eocene, the size of the carbon flux that must have been brought into the ocean/atmosphere carbon cycle in that one event, is on a par with the entire reserve of conventional fossil fuels at present. A really big number – but exactly how big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story starts off innocently enough with a new paper by &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ngeo578.html"&gt;Richard Zeebe and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Geoscience to tackle exactly this question. They use a carbon cycle model, tuned to conditions in the Paleocene, to constrain the amount of carbon that must have come into the system to cause both the sharp isotopic spike and a very clear change in the “carbonate compensation depth” (CCD) – this is the depth at which carbonates dissolve in sea water (a function of the pH, pressure, total carbon amount etc.). There is strong evidence that the the CCD rose hundreds of meters over the PETM – causing clear dissolution events in shallower ocean sediment cores. What Zeebe et al. come up with is that around 3000 Gt carbon must have been added to the system – a significant increase on the original estimates of about half that much made a decade or so ago, though less than some high end speculations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature changes at the same time as this huge carbon spike were large too. Note that this is happening on a Paleocene background climate that we don’t fully understand either – the polar amplification in very warm paleo-climates is much larger than we’ve been able to explain using standard models. Estimates range from 5 to 9 deg C warming (with some additional uncertainty due to potential problems with  the proxy data) – smaller in the tropics than at higher latitudes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting these two bits of evidence together is where it starts to get tricky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, how much does atmospheric CO2 rise if you add 3000 GtC to the system in a (geologically) short period of time? Zeebe et al. did this calculation and the answer is about 700 ppmv – quite a lot eh? However, that is a perturbation to the &lt;em&gt;Paleocene&lt;/em&gt; carbon cycle – which they assume has a base CO2 level of 1000 ppm, and so you only get a 70% increase – i.e. not even a doubling of CO2. And since the forcing that goes along with an increase in CO2 is logarithmic, it is the percent change in CO2 that matters rather than the absolute increase. The radiative forcing associated with that is about 2.6 W/m2. Unfortunately, we don’t (yet) have very good estimates of background CO2 levels in Paleocene. The proxies we do have suggest significantly higher values than today, but they aren’t precise. Levels could have been less than 1000 ppm, or even significantly more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (and this is a key assumption that we’ll get to later) this was the only forcing associated with the PETM event, how much warmer would we expect the planet to get? One might be tempted to use the standard ‘Charney’ climate sensitivity (2-4.5ºC per doubling of CO2) that is discussed so much in the IPCC reports. That would give you a mere 1.5-3ºC warming which appears inadequate. However, this is inappropriate for at least two reasons. First, the Charney sensitivity is a quite carefully defined metric that is used to compare a certain class of atmospheric models. It assumes that there are no other changes in atmospheric composition (aerosols, methane, ozone) and no changes in vegetation, ice sheets or ocean circulation. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the warming we expect if we just increase CO2 and let everything else adjust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the concept we should be looking at is the Earth System Sensitivity (a usage I am trying to get more widely adopted) as we mentioned last year in our discussion of ‘&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2/"&gt;Target CO2&lt;/a&gt;‘. The point is that all of those factors left out of the Charney sensitivity are going to change, and we are interested in the response of the whole Earth System – not just an idealised little piece of it that happens to fit with what was included in GCMs in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the Paleocene, it is unlikely that changes in ice sheets were very relevant (there weren’t any to speak of). But changes in vegetation, ozone, methane and aerosols (of various sorts) would certainly be expected. Estimates of the ESS taken from the Pliocene, or from the changes over the whole Cenozoic imply that the ESS is likely to be larger than the Charney sensitivity since vegetation, ozone and methane feedbacks are all amplifying. I’m on an upcoming paper that suggests a value about 50% bigger, while Jim Hansen has suggested a value about twice as big as Charney. That would give you an expected range of temperature increases of 2-5ºC (our estimate) or 3-6ºC (Hansen) (note that uncertainty bands are increasing here but the ranges are starting to overlap with the observations). ALl of this assumes that there are no huge non-linearities in climate sensitivity in radically different climates – something we aren’t at all sure about either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s go back to the first key assumption – that CO2 forcing is the only direct impact of the PETM event. The source of all this carbon has to satisfy two key constraints – it must be from a very depleted biogenic source and it needs to be relatively accessible. The leading candidate for this is methane hydrate – a kind of methane ice that is found in cold conditions and under pressure on continental margins – often capping large deposits of methane gas itself. Our information about such deposits in the Paleocene is sketchy to say the least, but there are plenty of ideas as to why a large outgassing of these deposits might have occurred (tectonic uplift in the proto-Indian ocean, volcanic activity in the North Atlantic, switches in deep ocean temperature due to the closure of key gateways into the Arctic etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the issue of the trigger though, we have the fascinating question of what happens to the methane that would be released in such a scenario. The standard assumption (used in the Zeebe et al paper) is that the methane would oxidise (to CO2) relatively quickly and so you don’t need to worry about the details. But work that &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/2003/Schmidt_Shindell.html"&gt;Drew Shindell and I&lt;/a&gt; did a few years ago suggested that this might not quite be true. We found that atmospheric chemistry feedbacks in such a circumstance could increase the impact of methane releases by a factor of 4 or so. While this isn’t enough to sustain a high methane concentration for tens of thousands of years following an initial pulse, it might be enough to enhance the peak radiative forcing if the methane was being released continuously over a few thousand years. The increase in the case of a 3000 GtC pulse would be on the order of a couple of W/m2 – for as long as the methane was being released. That would be a significant boost to the CO2-only forcing given above – and enough (at least for relatively short parts of the PETM) to bring the temperature and forcing estimates into line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, much of this is speculative given the difficulty in working out what actually happened 55 million years ago. The press response to the Zeebe et al paper was, however, very predictable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems probably started with the title of the paper “Carbon dioxide forcing alone insufficient to explain Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum warming” which on it’s own might have been unproblematic. However, it was paired with a &lt;a href="http://www.rice.edu/nationalmedia/news2009-07-14-globalwarming.shtml"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from Rice University that was titled “Global warming: Our best guess is likely wrong”, containing the statement from Jerry Dickens that “There appears to be something fundamentally wrong with the way temperature and carbon are linked in climate models”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the know-nothings agree one hundred per cent with these two last statements, it took no time at all for the press release to get passed along by Marc Morano, posted on Drudge, and declared the final nail in the coffin for ‘alarmist’ global warming science on WUWT (&lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2009/07/global_warming_our_best_guess.html"&gt;Andrew Freedman at WaPo&lt;/a&gt; has a good discussion of this). The fact that what was really being said was that climate sensitivity is probably &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; than produced in standard climate models seemed to pass almost all of these people by (though a few of their more astute commenters did pick up on it).  Regardless, the message went out that ‘climate models are wrong’ with the implicit sub-text that current global warming is nothing to worry about. Almost the exact opposite point that the authors wanted to make (another &lt;a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/uhnews?20090714185609"&gt;press release from U. Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; was much better in that respect). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might have been done differently? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, headlines and titles that simply confirm someone’s prior belief (even if that belief is completely at odds with the substance of the paper) are a really bad idea. Many people do not go beyond the headline – they read it, they agree with it, they move on. Also one should avoid truisms. All ‘models’ are indeed wrong – they are models, not perfect representations of the real world. The real question is whether they are useful – what do they underestimate? overestimate? and are they sufficiently complete?  Thus a much better title for the press release would have been more specific “”Global warming: Our best guess is likely too small” – and much less misinterpretable!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a lot of the confusion is related to the use of the word ‘model’ itself. When people hear ‘climate model’, they generally think of the big ocean-atmosphere models run by GISS, NCAR or Hadley Centre etc. for the 20th Century climate and for future scenarios. The model used in Zeebe et al was not one of these, instead it was a relatively sophisticated carbon cycle model that tracks the different elements of the carbon cycle, but not the changes in climate. The conclusions of the study related to the sensitivity of the climate used the standard range of sensitivities from IPCC TAR (1.5 to 4.5ºC for a doubling of CO2), which have been constrained – not by climate models – but by &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/03/climate-sensitivity-plus-a-change/"&gt;observed climate changes&lt;/a&gt;. Thus nothing in the paper related to the commonly accepted ‘climate models’ at all, yet most of the commentary made the incorrect association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, there is still a great deal of mystery about the PETM – the trigger, where the carbon came from and what happened to it – and the latest research hasn’t tied up all the many loose ends. Whether the solution lies in something ‘fundamental’ as Dickens surmises (possibly related to our basic inability to explain the latitudinal gradients in any of the very warm climates) , or whether it’s a combination of a different forcing function combined with more inclusive ideas about climate sensitivity, is yet to be determined. However, we can all agree that it remains a tantalisingly relevant episode of Earth history.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249948249974"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/paul_romers_radical_idea_chart.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7248c350e76d390b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Paul Romer's radical idea: Charter cities</title><published>2009-08-10T23:26:01Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T23:26:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/EREl8XyTIMw/paul_romers_radical_idea_chart.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/paul_romers_radical_idea_chart.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/paul_romers_radical_idea_chart.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/EREl8XyTIMw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249947518660"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/08/10/far-away-but-not-out-of-radios-reach/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30734b7d7e280749</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Global Warming"/><category term="Talks"/><title type="html">Far Away, But Not Out of Radio’s Reach</title><published>2009-08-10T23:37:26Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T23:37:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/08/10/far-away-but-not-out-of-radios-reach/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/prevsite/bigappledore.jpg" align="left" height="225" width="300"&gt;We arrived on &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2007/08/20/voyage-to-organism-island/"&gt;Appledore Island&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, which is drenched in sunshine and heat.

But despite the fact that New Hampshire is just a strip on the horizon, the email and the cell phones work here, and this evening I was asked to talk on the radio tomorrow about my recent article on &lt;a href="http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2178"&gt;global warming and evolution&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Both Mark and K.C. are award winning journalists and authors.

K.C. teaches journalism and communication at &lt;a href="http://annenberg.usc.edu/"&gt;USC’s Annenberg School of Journalism&lt;/a&gt; and her latest book is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0151008221?tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0151008221&amp;amp;adid=17YZ8372A8TQVP7S37PG&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each expert shared their career experiences and offered advice on speaking with journalists. They weighed in on why science reporting matters and how it’s changing. Mark focused on the state of the media and K.C. shared her perspective on how a journalist collects information to tell the story. In the end we discussed what styles of communication are most sucessful in America.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll indulge me . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was baptized Catholic, and was raised as a Christian; at least until I was old enough to decide for myself about going to church. The odd thing is, I don’t really think I was ever a believer. Maybe my mind wasn’t equipped, at that time, to contemplate the stories and their place in reality. Or maybe my youth and my curiosity about things in the natural world around me superseded any desire I may have had to investigate the religion further. What ever the case, I never really thought about the supernatural elements that members of the church are expected to believe in any critical fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was, however, highly aware of the things I was supposed to do and of the things I was not supposed to do. After all, there were live, flesh and blood adults in the church and in my community re-enforcing the dogma, especially the ideas of sin and punishment. Through attrition, those ideas worked their way into my little boy brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that coupled with my desire to please my parents, and the other adults, was enough to keep me in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only after I had stopped going to church, and actually started studying the various world religions, that I turned a critical eye toward the supernatural elements and the legends I’d grown up with. And of course, a good critical, unbiased examination reveals that there is no magic. It also exposes the stories as merely re-hashed ancient myths and, by turns, renders religion itself quite useless to progressive people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before I found myself comfortable with the labels “agnostic” and “atheist”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a strange thing happened. I wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with a fresh, new worldview, I realized that a lot of my writing (and my part in a lot of discussions) was taking on a decidedly anti-religious tone. I seemed angry. I seemed to be attacking religious people for the simple fact of their belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concerned me a great deal, because I really like people. I enjoy interaction with everyone, despite their beliefs. I didn’t want to be making enemies, so I had to try to understand my anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after a lot of reflection, the answer became obvious. It was simply that I held a grudge for being made to feel guilty for certain things as a child. I was made to feel fear for no good reason. I had been forced to accept nonsense, as well as to spend a lot of time engaged in activities that kept me from doing things I really wanted to do. And all of that had stemmed from what amounted to one big lie. I sensed injustice in that, and I was pissed off about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with understanding comes healing, and I decided I didn’t want to hold grudges anymore. I didn’t want to cultivate anger. I thought it best to let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, the religions of the world still do things that make me angry, and I write about them here on occasion, sometimes with more vitriol than is probably called for. But it’s no longer personal, and I don’t hold the anger for long. I say my piece, and then I move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I feel that from an intellectual standpoint, I’m happier now without the anger, and certainly happier than I ever was as a member of a church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I think religious people are &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;happy. The opposite is most likely true; at least on some level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that once one learns that life is not about placating an unseen deity, but about enjoying, studying, growing within, and sometimes even fearing the human condition, one finds the size of the flock has expanded well beyond the confines of any church walls. The neighbors, the waves and handshakes, the smiles, the laughs, the tears, the births and deaths, the good times and the bad are more numerous and more substantively varied. It can be a catharsis, a wonderful, beautiful thing to step away from religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for me, it was just a matter of getting past the anger to fully enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249945478401"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3803">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/657151b05dfd3948</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Articles"/><category term="Francis Collins"/><category term="Frans de Waal"/><category term="morality"/><category term="Steven Pinker"/><title type="html">The origins of morality</title><published>2009-08-10T22:06:08Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T22:06:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/the-origins-of-morality/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Greg Mayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the curious things in Francis Collins’ &lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt; is his claim that there are no, or scarcely any, antecedents of moral behavior in animals.  He writes (p. 23):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As best I can tell, this law [the &amp;quot;Moral Law&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;&amp;#39;the law of right behavior&amp;#39;&amp;quot;] appears to apply peculiarly to human beings. Though  other animals may at times appear to show glimmerings of a moral sense, they are certainly not widespread, and in many instances other species’ behavior seems to be in dramatic contrast to any sense of universal rightness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite aside from the all too frequent times when human beings’ behavior seems to be in dramatic contrast to any sense of universal rightness (&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/11/world/middleeast/11iraq.html?hp"&gt;see any newspaper&lt;/a&gt;), a point made by, among others, &lt;a href="http://www.reasonproject.org/archive/item/the_strange_case_of_francis_collins2/"&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt;, the statement is jarring to anyone at all acquainted with the behavior of vertebrate animals, especially a phylogenetically diverse group of them. The incipient stages of the development of the moral sense, and the gradations in the complexity of familial and social behavior in animals, have long been known and documented (see, e.g. Darwin’s accounts in&lt;em&gt; Expression of the Emotions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Descent of Man&lt;/em&gt;), but they’re also pretty evident to anyone who’s owned a dog. Indeed, among my earliest contributions to the WEIT blog was an application of Steve Pinker’s “&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/15/steven-pinkers-take-on-the-material-mind/"&gt;rudimentary moral sentiments&lt;/a&gt;” to my &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/do-animals-have-morality-for-i-will-consider-my-cat-peyton-a-response/"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/sympathy-for-the-human-further-consideration-of-my-cat-peyton/"&gt;Peyton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic Christian theologians might also be surprised by Collins’ claim. St. Thomas Aquinas, in his account of &lt;a href="http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/issues/natural.asp"&gt;natural law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FS_Q94_A2.html"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because in man there is first of all an inclination to good in accordance with the nature which he has in common with all substances…  Secondly, there is in man an inclination to things that pertain to him more specially, according to &lt;em&gt;that nature which he has in common with other animals&lt;/em&gt;: and in virtue of this inclination, &lt;em&gt;those things are said to belong to the natural law, “which nature has taught to all animals&lt;/em&gt;…” [emphases added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just to make it clear, St. Thomas views these shared inclinations as good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because while in Costa Rica earlier this summer, I read &lt;a href="http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/dewaal.html"&gt;Frans de Waal&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Natured-Origins-Humans-Animals/dp/0674356616/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1249940904&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the book, de Waal makes a convincing case for a wide assortment of moral and pre-moral sentiments in non-human animals, especially primates.  There is in fact every indication of a wide range of such sentiments in animals, ranging from tender parental care in crocodilians and birds, to a sense of fairness in chimps. Jerry earlier  &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/17/two-articles-about-animal-morality/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about some of de Waal’s work, and a quote from him (i.e. de Waal) in an article in the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4632069/Morality-may-have-roots-in-our-primate-ancestors.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;, states it nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not arguing that non-human primates are moral beings but there is enough evidence for the following of social rules to agree that some of the stepping stones towards human morality can be found in other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's "death panel" so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their "level of productivity in society," whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such as system, were it to to exist, or even to be proposed, &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be evil.  Since no one has proposed any such thing, Palin has Godwined herself even closer to irrelevancy.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/sarah_palins_immoral_rantings.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/Q4UJlc9abwM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249944574615"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/10/another-carnival-in-space/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4019a77e982b036d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Another carnival!

&lt;p&gt;Wiker’s view depends in large part on the supposition that German evolutionary thinking about evolution actually followed Darwin.  However, as &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000162" rel="external "&gt;a recent book review&lt;/a&gt; in PLoS Biology points out, what reached Germany was not the English version of &lt;em&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, it was a translation by German paleontologist Heinrich Georg Bronn that was a main source of German notions of Darwinian evolution, and those notions were a distortion of Darwin’s views.  Bronn had a substantially different conception of evolution than Darwin, and Bronn’s translation apparently incorporated a good bit of his own conception rather than being a straight translation of Darwin.  Bronn even added an extra chapter to &lt;em&gt;OoS&lt;/em&gt; incorporate his own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get no hits searching for Bronn in &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/kpjljl" rel="external "&gt;three of Wiker’s books&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;10 Books That Screwed Up the Word&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Architects of the Culture of Death&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Moral Darwinism: How we became hedonists&lt;/em&gt;) in Google books.   (&lt;em&gt;The Darwin Myth&lt;/em&gt; is unfortunately not searchable.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, finding no mention of Bronn, particularly in &lt;em&gt;Architects of the Culture of Death&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Moral Darwinism&lt;/em&gt;, I tentatively infer that Wiker didn’t bother to note the translation and distortion of &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; through Bronn’s ‘progressive/perfection evolution’ lens.  That’s obvious in some places.  For example, in &lt;em&gt;Architects of the Culture of Death&lt;/em&gt;, De Marco and Wiker wrote&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to assertions of all too many historians, it is no stretch at all to fo from Darwin to Haeckel’s Darwinist Monism and on to Hitler’s Nazism, as the words of Hitler himself make quite clear: “Providence [i.e., the laws of nature] has endowed living creatures with a limitless fecundity, but she has not put in their reach, without the need for effort on their part, all the food they need.  All that is very right and proper, for it is the struggle for existence that produces the selection of the fittest.”  Natural selection is the engine of purification, and as with all other species of nature, this purification demans the isolation of particular breeds or races. (p. 115)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That skips right over Bronn’s insertion of progressive perfectionism into Darwin’s non-progressivist evolution.  And it’s that progressivism, that notion that evolution somehow is directed at perfection, that infected German biology via Bronn and Haeckel.  The authors go on to say &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, to find that Haeckel’s evolutionary eugenic arguments undergirded the Nazi eugenic program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haeckel&lt;/em&gt;, not Darwin, via Bronn, since Haeckel was not fluent in English but probably read &lt;em&gt;OoS&lt;/em&gt; in Bronn’s translation.  I welcome corrections from historians.&lt;/p&gt;

All reactions in various polymerization known today are not unconceivable in the scheme of organic synthesis. There is no new concept in reaction mechanisms. In contrast, the unique properties of polymer materials mainly stem from chain topology rather than detailed chemical structures, which have led the polymer physics research from Flory’s mean-field theory, in a statistical physical scheme, to de Gennes’s scaling theory, in a fractal and non-equilibrium physical scheme. This strand of study have long been stimulating the synthetic effort for precise, monodispersed model polymers for experiment, because most theories that are mathematically tractable assume a monodispersity presumption.

However, stories from the industrial world may be a little different. Broader molecular weight distribution, for example, is favorable in rubber processing, for the resulting plasticizing effect from the lower molecular weight portion. Branched structures are also desired in many cases of polyolefin applications, i.e. blends. In some rarer cases, unknown additives during processing can affect the product properties so significantly that alternative routes assumed to result in the same product would mysterious give a very different product in fact. In the theoretical aspect, empirical equations, derived by phenomenological methods, are also more favored by engineers, although most of these equations have little to no physical meaning. The above mentioned differences between industrial and academic studies constitute a large part of the reasons for the depletion of the two fields. And researchers in the former fields may know much less about the latter than they should be, while not necessarily vise versa.

In the latest issue of Science, a special one of industrial chemistry, Phillip Hustad told a colorful story1 about how industrial research effort, under additional constraint of cost or price, give rise to new commercial polyolefins which continue the legend of polymeric material after a century of development. The article is also thought-provoking for academic research, trying to inform us a long-been-neglected origin of innovation.

The article mainly focus in one ongoing innovative process in the industry, namely Olefin Block Copolymers (OBCs), describing why early research failed when commercial consideration comes in, and highlighting the ideas that lead to recent commercial success. It is an amazing story. But more invaluable of this article are some in-depth words by the author that really tell some truth:

[T]he development of polymeric materials is much more challenging when practical constraints are imposed and success is defined by commercial viability. It is often the case that overcoming one obstacle simply leads to another, but useful innovations can stem from explorations of these perceived contradictions…It is common sentiment that “precise” and “useful” are directly correlated in polymeric materials. This may be tru for many applications, but the required level of precision ultimately depends on the material’s desired function. With biological systems, a single mistake can have drastic consequences, but in simpler polymeric materials, the penalties for imperfections are far less grave.

However, knowing now the difference in results between academic and industrial research, it is still impossible and unnecessary trying to extend the academic kind of research wisely and replace the industrial labs, because of their different in motives.

Industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D differ in a number of ways, most notably the motivation behind them…The difference between the two missions is evident in the way success is measured. In industry, success comes with commercial sales of the material, but in academia, success is measured by winning grants and publication of results in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. The academic researcher is less constrained with respect to practicality, scalability, or final product price; creativity is the bottom line. The industrial researcher, on the other hand, knows that even the most creative scientific breakthrough must ultimately lead to a commercially viable product for the company to realize an economic benefit.

Between lines, this comparison implies that the trait of academic research has been determined by the whole system, the journals, the publish-or-perish rule, and the peer reviewers — ourselves. Industrial labs have less pressure to publish, which allow the researchers with time and patience to identify and solve real world problems. Possibly the detached of academic research from the real world and ordinary life also causes the misunderstanding of scientists among the public. Most modern products which ordinary people enjoy have distant and vague relation to the ongoing research of pure science, while the creativity of academic researchers reported by various press releases is just “useless”, if not “dangerous”. In addition to strenuously explaining the relationship between the cutting-edge scientific breakthrough and the ordinary life for the public, as some scientists and science writers have been trying to do, maybe the research system itself should also consider a change that includes more real world problems, which makes the impact of research more obvious both for peer-review journals and for the mass.

One result of this visit is an epic post by PZ which pretty much obviates any need to actually to go to the museum yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a student assigned to go to the museum and do a report on it, just use PZ's blog post, it will be much easier.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_creation_museum_1.php"&gt;Here it is!  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She is beautiful, sweet and funny, and despite our obviously different worldviews, we have managed to stay good friends for  many years. When I painted a painting about psychics, she agreed to be the subject. Before I shared it with the world, she came over to take a look at finished painting to give her approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:503px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.surlyramics.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://surlyramics.com/Surlyramics/surly_amys_paintings_files/The%20psychic%20webs%20size.jpg" alt="" width="493" height="643"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Psychic&amp;quot; 2009 by Amy Davis Roth Acrylic on Canvas 3ftx4ft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her visit, we had a conversation about her psychic powers and she told me essentially that she was more of an “intuitive”. She told me that the lines on your hands and face are a road map to who you are, where you have been, and where you are heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her to tell me something about the future. She said she couldn’t predict the future; she can only warn people of where they might be heading. I asked here where the information comes from when she gives readings and if she has ever heard of cold reading. She told me that she is aware of cold reading but does not use it. She said there is energy all around us and just like a cell phone picks up waves, she too can tune in to certain energies to find answers and to give meaning to client’s questions. We went back and forth for a bit. I told her she had a profound misunderstanding of science and technology and that psychics are just scamming people for money. She smiled and told me that she inherited her abilities from the women in her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she got a call from a client who needed a private double reading done and had to leave. She approved of the painting and asked if I would make her a print. We hugged. Neither one of us had even slightly changed our opinion; both of us convinced that we are trying to help the world by spreading the truth in our own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a “reading” of my own that I put on the painting. It is meant for the viewer (that’s you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the moon begins to wane this month you may become more and more aware that things are not quite what you thought they were. Your house of finance may be threatened if you don’t come to terms with these new realizations. You may want to reevaluate where you stand in the world or you may find yourself disappointed. The truth is a slippery fish but the fishbowl it resides in is clear. You just must be willing to look. You may regret it if you let the chance slip by and remember, when the student is ready the teacher will appear, just be sure the teacher isn’t after your wallet. There is a new friend and a new foe around every corner and you will find them both. Put your trust into the outstretched hands of the wise and not the greedy or the uniformed. The future tells no tales. The cards and the stars are blind to your folly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Detail of “The Psychic”&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has left me with a few questions. If you truly believe in what you are doing or if you simply don’t know any better, is it less of a scam? Is it a scam at all if you are just giving advice based on what you believe to be true? Is my friend a psychic or a life coach with props? And ultimately, can a skeptic and a believer stay friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a 35 second video of me painting this painting. It is my first attempt at documenting the process of painting.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/history/hitler_zombie/"&gt;Hitler Zombie&lt;/a&gt;? He doesn't show up all that much anymore. The reason is not because a lot of brain dead Nazi analogies aren't being used to demonize political opponents. In fact, If I had a mind to, I could probably populate this blog with nothing other than people whose brains have obviously been eaten by the zombie, leaving so little intellectual firepower left that they actually believe that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/have_the_conservatives_in_just_two_and_a.php"&gt;comparing President Obama to Hitler&lt;/a&gt; makes sense. Mainly, the reason that I don't do Hitler Zombie bits so often anymore is that the monster has chomped so many brains, producing so much craziness and so many idiotic, historically ignorant Hitler analogies, that the crazy bar has been raised to too high a level. What would have been an excellent example of over-the-top nonsense for a satirical blog post featuring the undead &lt;em&gt;Führer&lt;/em&gt; in a story demonstrating his mad brain chompin' skillz three years ago would barely register as anything unusual today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is with, sadly, the health care debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest nonsense appears to be emanating from (who else?) Rush Limbaugh and other right wing pundits, and it's shown just how low opponents of President Obama's health care reform initiative will go. I'm not saying that there aren't a lot of problems with the bill and many points of legitimate disagreement. However, the latest attack has nothing to do with anything of the sort. Rather, it's the usual use of the argumentum ad Hitlerium gambit: pure demonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of this when a reader sent me this &lt;a href="http://209.157.64.200/focus/news/2309491/posts"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, in which Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referred to protesters crashing town hall meetings on health care reform "wearing things like Nazi swastikas." The implication was that Pelosi was saying that Republicans were Nazis and that maybe she'd make a good "victim" of the Hitler zombie. I've never liked Nancy Pelosi (I think she's an idiot, quite frankly), but I don't think that's the correct interpretation. Again, go back to the "Tea Parties" and see that, indeed, there were lots of protesters carrying Nazi swastikas and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/have_the_conservatives_in_just_two_and_a.php"&gt;equating President Obama to Hitler&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I think Pelosi just stated what she was trying to say very poorly and that she was simply referring to &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/06/anti-obama-protester-comp_n_252815.html"&gt;such protesters&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/blog/2009/08/ss-nazi-sign/"&gt;do in fact exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And certainly the opposition to Obamacare isn't shy about Nazi analogies. Get a load of the latest, namely the claim that President Obama's symbol for his health care initiative &lt;a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2009/08/obamas-healthcare-reform.html"&gt;looks like a Nazi symbol&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, go to Rush Limbaugh's website, and you will see a &lt;a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_080609/content/01125106.guest.html"&gt;Flash animation of the Nazi symbol morphing into the Obama symbol&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/the_latest_obama_hitler_shenanigans_too.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/the_latest_obama_hitler_shenanigans_too.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/L7piz_EthWk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249938207671"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/search_term_hilariosity.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1eb6943f29458692</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Search Term Hilariosity</title><published>2009-08-10T20:04:37Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T20:04:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/GFNT4BWgMeM/search_term_hilariosity.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/search_term_hilariosity.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I am bored, I look at the things people search for to find me.  Here are search terms for the last hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people.   The proposed ‘regulation’ would do nothing to protect the public.  Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are ‘properly trained’.  But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place.  The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this?  That’s easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation  committees simply don’t look.  They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on.  Here’s some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these ‘degrees’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places.  Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sanjiao-1.jpg" alt="slide 1" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sanjiao-2.jpg" alt="slide 2" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sanjiao-7.jpg" alt="slide 7" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sanjiao-8.jpg" alt="slide 8" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sanjiao-21.jpg" alt="slide 21" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious indeed.  The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/sanjiao-16.jpg" alt="slide 16" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Herbal approaches for patients with cancer.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having  these dangerous fantasies revealed.  The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-1x.jpg" alt="slide 1" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First get them scared with some bad statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-2.jpg" alt="slide 2" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of &lt;a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153"&gt;statistics at Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt; might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better (&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/#"&gt;from CDC&lt;/a&gt;). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/cancer-death-rate.jpg" alt="cance death rates" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-3.jpg" alt="slide 3" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939).  It  &lt;strong&gt;certainly poses a huge danger to patients&lt;/strong&gt;.  It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-11.jpg" alt="slide 11" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. “Strengthen vitality” sounds good but means nothing. And “enhancing the immune system” is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a ‘tonic’ was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently.  The use of the word by The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920"&gt;Prince of Wales’ company&lt;/a&gt;, Duchy Originals recently &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html" title="Quackometer site"&gt;fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/a&gt;, and his herbal ‘remedies’ were&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm"&gt; zapped by the MHRA (&lt;/a&gt;Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90"&gt; antioxidant myth&lt;/a&gt; is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-16.jpg" alt="slide 16" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Inhibits the recurrence of cancer”!   That sounds terrific.  But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a &lt;a href="http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/"&gt;part of NHS Evidence.  It &lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm"&gt;launched in 2006&lt;/a&gt;.  The clinical lead was none other than &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22" title="Lots of appearences of Peter Fisher here"&gt;Peter Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen’s homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22" title="Lots more about Westminster"&gt;University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;  (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that &lt;em&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/em&gt;, is even worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention &lt;em&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm"&gt;its herb list&lt;/a&gt;. It does get a mention in &lt;a href="http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&amp;amp;restrict=cochrane_org&amp;amp;scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&amp;amp;client=my_collection&amp;amp;scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&amp;amp;scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;site=my_collection&amp;amp;ie=&amp;amp;oe=&amp;amp;scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&amp;amp;scso_newsletters=newsletters&amp;amp;scso_cochrane_org=this_site&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;Cochrane reviews&lt;/a&gt; but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-21.jpg" alt="slide 21" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What on earth is a “lymph remedy”.  Just another marketing term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a very dramatic claim.  It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by “especially valuable in the treatment of”?  Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn’t the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM.  &lt;em&gt;Phytolacca&lt;/em&gt; is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn’t mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-23.jpg" alt="slide 23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah the mistletoe story, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists&lt;a href="http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&amp;amp;restrict=cochrane_org&amp;amp;scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&amp;amp;client=my_collection&amp;amp;scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&amp;amp;scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;site=my_collection&amp;amp;ie=&amp;amp;oe=&amp;amp;scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&amp;amp;scso_newsletters=newsletters&amp;amp;scso_cochrane_org=this_site&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt; three completed assessments&lt;/a&gt;. One concludes that more research is needed.  Another concludes that “Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy”, and the third says “The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of  mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved  ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCCAM &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe"&gt;says of mistletoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than 30 human studies using  mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but  major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their  findings (see &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21"&gt;Question 6&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very  few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe  extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans  (see &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25"&gt;Question 7&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) has not  approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28"&gt;Question 8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported,   sold,  or used except for &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&amp;amp;version=Patient&amp;amp;language=English"&gt;clinical&lt;/a&gt; research (see &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28"&gt;Question 8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviews lists &lt;a href="http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=mistletoe&amp;amp;restrict=cochrane_org&amp;amp;scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&amp;amp;client=my_collection&amp;amp;scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&amp;amp;scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;amp;sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;amp;site=my_collection&amp;amp;ie=&amp;amp;oe=&amp;amp;scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&amp;amp;scso_newsletters=newsletters&amp;amp;scso_cochrane_org=this_site&amp;amp;proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;several reviews of mistletoe&lt;/a&gt; with similar conclusions. &lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html"&gt;For example&lt;/a&gt; “The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find.  A post on that topic is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-25.jpg" alt="slide 25" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Indicated for cancers  . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung&lt;/strong&gt;“.  &lt;strong&gt;A cure for lung cancer?&lt;/strong&gt; That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words “indicated for”.  Even &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; makes no mention of any claims that &lt;em&gt;Thuja&lt;/em&gt;  benefits  cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn’t mention &lt;em&gt;Thuja&lt;/em&gt; for any indication.  Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews.  That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given.  In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-27.jpg" alt="slide 27" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey’s treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-28.jpg" alt="slide 28" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-30.jpg" alt="slide 30" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More unfounded claims when it says “treated successfully many cancer patients”. No references and no data to support the claim.  It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-31.jpg" alt="slide 31" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; you get “a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day.  Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.”. At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6"&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; carrot juice was given instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt; says “there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer”, and “The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.”  Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/herbal-cancer-36.jpg" alt="slide 36" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It’s nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide (&lt;a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf"&gt;from a talk by Melinda Wharton&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/wharton-slide2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/wharton-slide2s.jpg" alt="Wharton slide 2" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span&gt;Click to enlarge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="pox"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies,  Take a look at &lt;a href="http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/"&gt;Vaccine-preventable diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of ‘education’ which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/Baltimore-smallpox-1939s.jpg" alt="Baltimore smallpox, 1939"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html"&gt;Smallpox in Baltimore,&lt;/a&gt; USA, 1939.  This man was not vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. &lt;/p&gt;

There have been countless reviews investigating the effects of discrimination on health, but none that have quite looked at the quantitative nature of this relationship. Pascoe and Richman decided to undertake this task by examining the strength of the evidence for the effect of perceived discrimination on multiple health outcomes through a meta-analysis.  They discovered that an increased level of perceived discrimination is associated with more negative mental and physical health. In addition, they found that perceived discrimination was associated with heightened psychological and physical stress responses as well as increased participation in unhealthy behaviors. These relationships remained even when important covariates such as demographics were included. Moderating variables included social support and coping style.So the next time you feel like you&amp;#39;re being unfairly discriminated against be sure to have lots of family and friends to back you up, think logically through the problem, and take action!Pascoe EA, &amp;amp; Smart Richman L (2009).

Their recipe for the “compatibility” of science and religion consists of two teeny-weeny modifications to the scientific method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Observation is not a reliable way of gathering data&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting modern scientific ideas into [the Bible] distorts the meaning of the text, which is clearly about God’s faithful and caring relation to the world, not the details of how that world came to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, even though the &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1"&gt;very first chapter&lt;/a&gt; gives a somewhat explicit description of, well, how the world came to be, that’s “clearly” not what the book’s about, and “clearly” you’re supposed to ignore that part.  (Many of the other parts are “clearly” 100% true, of course.  Which parts?  I can’t believe you’d even ask such an impertinent question!  Clearly you have no future as a BioLogos Scientist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Only test &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of your hypotheses&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we learn from science cannot threaten our belief in God as the creator. If God created the universe in a Big Bang 15 billion years ago, guided its development with elegant mathematical laws so that eventually there would be big-brained mammals exploring things such as beauty, morality and truth, then let us celebrate that idea, not reject it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can what we learn from science threaten our beliefs in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_birth_of_Jesus"&gt;human parthenogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaves_and_fishes"&gt;non-conservation of bread and fish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_of_Jesus#Biblical_accounts"&gt;spontaneous heaven-ascension&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article doesn’t say, but based on my experiences with BioLogos, I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that “clearly” it cannot.

Allow me to explain.  You see, every so often, a comet zooms in from the Kuiper Belt.  As it approaches the Sun, it heats up, displaying a spectacular tail.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/get_up_early_this_wednesday/060227comet.jpg" width="500" alt="060227comet.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this "tail" actually?  It's tiny, tiny fragments of ice and rock that make up the comet.  You see, comets are like miniature, frozen planets.  The gravity holding a comet together is amazingly weak because they're so tiny.  For comparison, a grain of sand on the surface of a comet experiences less than 0.002% of gravity on Earth.  This gravity is so small that tiny, micron-sized pieces of dust, in combination with the ice-melting light from the Sun, can knock tiny fragments of this comet off of it, leaving a spectacular dust trail throughout the inner Solar System.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/get_up_early_this_wednesday/encke-trail.png" width="504" height="504" alt="encke-trail.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, here's the fun part.  The Earth takes one year to orbit the Sun.  So, if a comet happened to leave a trail through the space where Earth passes, then &lt;i&gt;every year&lt;/i&gt;, when the Earth passes through that part of space, we will collide with that comet dust.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when that happens, &lt;b&gt;we get a meteor shower!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/get_up_early_this_wednesday/leonids100_am.jpg" width="500" height="441" alt="leonids100_am.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseids"&gt;Perseid&lt;/a&gt; meteor shower -- thanks to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/109P/Swift-Tuttle"&gt;Comet Swift-Tuttle&lt;/a&gt; which last appeared in 1992 -- takes place on August 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.  They're called the Perseids because they appear in the constellation Perseus.  However, that's not where you should look.  Most people have a hard time finding all but the simplest constellations.  The Big Dipper, the North Star, and that's it for most people.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky for you, one of the next easiest to find is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_(constellation)"&gt;Cassiopeia&lt;/a&gt;, the big "W" in the Sky:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/get_up_early_this_wednesday/Cassiopeia.gif" width="500" alt="Cassiopeia.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, right next to Cassiopeia, early in the morning of August 12th (before sunrise), you can see the Perseid meteor shower.  Because the Moon will be out, estimates are that you will &lt;a href="http://stardate.org/mediacenter/20090807.html"&gt;only be able to see about 100 meteors per hour&lt;/a&gt;, which is still pretty damned impressive.  Where should you look?  Right here:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/get_up_early_this_wednesday/stardate-perseids-20090807.jpg" width="500" alt="stardate-perseids-20090807.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you fail to get up Wednesday morning, look up again after sunset.  The meteors will be less frequent, but the Moon will not have risen yet, so you may get a second chance!  The best part about meteor showers?  &lt;b&gt;No equipment is necessary.&lt;/b&gt;  No telescopes, no binoculars, &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt;.  All you need is to get away from city lights.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So get up early!  Go!  Look!  And enjoy the beautiful sights of comet dust burning up in our upper atmosphere.  And if you won't get up and see for yourself, &lt;a href="http://spaceweather.com/meteors/gallery_12aug09.htm?PHPSESSID=981d0vk4cmp5dtekjik2dl3p35"&gt;check out the 2009 Perseid photo gallery!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/get_up_early_this_wednesday.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249933105822"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6293676818437599469">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4382f4bc10406d8a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Atheism Explained: What is an Atheist?</title><published>2009-08-10T16:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-11T11:37:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/Wq6-vX9Z3iE/atheism-explained-what-is-atheist.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6293676818437599469/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6293676818437599469" title="10 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/atheism-explained-what-is-atheist.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Words mean what I use them to mean. Dictionary definitions merely report how most people use words. They may not always report how I use them or how small groups of people use them. So any word can mean anything I use it to mean. The problem is that using words in some private sense that is unfamiliar to others will result in miscommunication. There is a shared understanding of how English people use words so we must use them in the standard ways if we want to be understood. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words are not static in their definitions either, but dynamic and forever changing. The word “nice” previously meant “stupid” and the word “gay” previously meant “happy,” but now they mean something different. That’s because how we use words evolve down through the centuries. There is Old- Middle- and Modern English, which was derived in part from German and even Greek forbearers. There is American, Britain, and Australian English. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let’s think about the word “atheism” in this light. I am an atheist. What do I mean when I use this word? I mean that I do not think there are any supernatural beings or supernatural forces. It’s not that I have no beliefs about them. I do. I believe they do not exist. People who do not have any beliefs about such beings are people who have never considered them in the first place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By using this word in that way the ONLY question left unresolved is whether I am effectively communicating to others. The problem is that there is no agreed upon definition of this word by atheists themselves. One of the problems is that atheism is a negative word. Etymologically speaking an atheist is a non-theist (a=non theist). Christians themselves were called atheists in the Roman days because they did not believe in the Roman pantheon. But if I were to say that some object is not a door I have not told you what that object is, only what it is not. The problem is further compounded by Christians themselves who wish to define the word for us as meaning “metaphysical naturalists,” which may not adequately describe all of us in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skeptics have proposed other words to positively describe themselves as “Brights” or “Secular Humanists.” There are agnostic atheists, spiritual atheists, and Christian atheists. There is both a positive and negative atheism. Buddhism may be described as an atheistic philosophy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Christians listening in on these discussions let me say for the record that I consider them to be little more than Wittgensteinian language games, which will probably be solved in the future as more and more atheists adopt the same language to describe the same thing, which, when the dust settles will indeed communicate who we are and what we share (if there is a "we" to be found). [Keep in mind that Christians have the same problem with the word “Christian.” Is everyone a Christian who describes himself as one? I repeatedly hear that some group or person is/was not a “true Christian.”] I suspect that if most everyone in the world became atheists there wouldn't even be a word to describe us. We would probably be described as human beings, or members of the same golf club, or of another type grouping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, Dr. John Shook &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blog/atheism_explained/"&gt;recently attempted to define it&lt;/a&gt;. See what you think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6293676818437599469?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It’s an incredibly useful book, and I can’t believe how irresponsible it was of me not to read it long ago. I have a small child to protect! Not being prepared for a zombie attack is almost as bad as leaving sippy cups full of anti-freeze on the coffee table,*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only concern with the Survival Guide is that it might be too long. What happens if you’re a slow reader, like me, and the zombie apocalypse happens while you’re still working your way through chapter 2? Sure, it would be hilariously ironic, but the hipster zombie you will never appreciate it because zombies don’t get irony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s form a plan together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your plan if zombies attack? Do you seeflaws in anyone else’s plans here? Please, don’t hold back, the survival of the human species is dependent upon us having a solid plan to defeat the zombies! What advice do you have for anyone who doesn’t have a zombie fighting strategy? (Any zombies answering today’s AI should identify themselves as such.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Yes, I’m planning on moving those to the kitchen… as soon as you quit nagging me about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an explicitly political blog, and for that reason, I don’t feel it’s appropriate for me to advocate for one or another proposed health care reform plan.  But I do want to encourage everyone to follow health care reform closely, and to &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3200/text"&gt;go to the primary sources&lt;/a&gt;. Certain aspects of the proposed bill will be hard for any of us to understand, especially cost.  There are all sorts of wild claims about how much reform will save us or cost us, and I’m betting that none of these claims is completely congruent with the truth.  But some of  what we’re hearing on the news is so far from the truth that to call them lies would be generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are spouting outright fear-mongering propaganda regarding health care reform, and in medicine, propaganda is the enemy of good decision-making.  Whether you are personally conservative, liberal, libertarian, or none of the above, you can’t have an informed opinion about health care reform without going to the primary source, the actual text of the bill.  If you listen to the pundits, they make it sound as if this bill is so impossibly long that no mere mortal can read it—this is not true.  The bill contains a lot of mundane information regarding definitions, etc., as it is a law that must be implemented, but the information about health care is pretty clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this space we’ll examine some of the more fanciful—non-economic–claims made about the proposed health care plan, using the text of HR 3200 (linked above) as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative effectiveness or Soylent Green?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal published &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204619004574320421050552730.html"&gt;an OpEd piece&lt;/a&gt; claiming that provisions providing for comparative effectiveness research amount to a system for denying senior citizens life-sustaining care.  It claimed, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assault against seniors began with the stimulus package in February. Slipped into the bill was substantial funding for comparative effectiveness research, which is generally code for limiting care based on the patient’s age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is poppycock.  “Comparative effectiveness” is an &lt;em&gt;au courant&lt;/em&gt; term used to describe research that looks at medical practice and tries to assess its effects. For example, there are two surgical ways to fix blood flow to the heart muscle: percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) such as angioplasty and stenting, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG or “heart bypass”). I’m not going to tell you which one is better, because the answer is complicated and still being investigated, but to choose the correct therapy for a patient we must answer a number of questions: which works best in which kind of patient; how long does each last; which has lower complication rates; which leads to longer survival; which leads to longer survival without additional need for a second intervention; which costs more, and over what time period; which makes people feel and function better. These questions and others need to be asked about many of the things we do, and comparative effectiveness research is a reasonable way to approach this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the actual bill say about comparative effectiveness?  &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3200/text?version=ih&amp;amp;nid=t0:ih:3299"&gt;Quite a  bit actually&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll look &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3200/text?version=ih&amp;amp;nid=t0:ih:3411"&gt;at just a little.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘(2) DISSEMINATION PROTOCOLS AND STRATEGIES- The Center shall develop protocols and strategies for the appropriate dissemination of research findings in order to ensure effective communication of findings and the use and incorporation of such findings into relevant activities for the purpose of informing higher quality and more effective and efficient decisions regarding medical items and services. In developing and adopting such protocols and strategies, the Center shall consult with stakeholders concerning the types of dissemination that will be most useful to the end users of information and may provide for the utilization of multiple formats for conveying findings to different audiences, including dissemination to individuals with limited English proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill sets up a commission, and sets out all of the details about how it will be constructed, funded, etc.  It does not in any way mandate, recommend, or approve of withholding care from people who need it.  To continue to inject honesty here, there are real implications to this stuff.  If we find, for instance, that getting MRIs on people with less than six weeks of knee pain does not affect the course of their injury, then there could be specific incentives and mandates to avoid these studies.  This will affect people who own MRIs.  This will affect the way doctors practice.  This may impinge on patient “choice”.  But it does not require us to “pull the plug” on old folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logan’s Run &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common myth circulating is that the bill would require doctors to counsel old folks on euthanasia.  This is patently absurd, and an intentional misreading of the bill. Here is the relevant excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;..the term `advance care planning consultation’ means a consultation between the individual and a practitioner described in paragraph (2) regarding advance care planning, if, subject to paragraph (3), the individual involved has not had such a consultation within the last 5 years. Such consultation shall include the following:`(A) An explanation by the practitioner of advance care planning, including key questions and considerations, important steps, and suggested people to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(B) An explanation by the practitioner of &lt;strong&gt;advance directives, including living wills and durable powers of attorney&lt;/strong&gt;, and their uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(C) An explanation by the practitioner of the role and responsibilities of a &lt;strong&gt;health care proxy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(D) The provision by the practitioner of a list of national and State-specific resources to assist consumers and their families with advance care planning, including the national toll-free hotline, the advance care planning clearinghouses, and State legal service organizations (including those funded through the Older Americans Act of 1965).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(E) An explanation by the practitioner of &lt;strong&gt;the continuum of end-of-life services and supports available, including palliative care and hospice&lt;/strong&gt;, and benefits for such services and supports that are available under this title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(F)(i) Subject to clause (ii), an &lt;strong&gt;explanation of orders regarding life sustaining treatment&lt;/strong&gt; or similar orders, which shall include–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(I) the reasons why the development of such an order is beneficial to the individual and the individual’s family and the reasons why such an order should be updated periodically as the health of the individual changes;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(II) the information needed for an individual or legal surrogate to make informed decisions regarding the completion of such an order; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`(III) the identification of resources that an individual may use to determine the requirements of the State in which such individual resides so that the treatment wishes of that individual will be carried out if the individual is unable to communicate those wishes, including requirements regarding the designation of a surrogate decisionmaker (also known as a health care proxy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already provide my patients with counseling regarding advanced directives, end of life care, home care, nursing home care, etc.,  but I can’t get paid for it. What the proposed bill would do is make it easier for me to talk to patients once in a while by actually paying me for my time and expertise. I’ve bolded some of the key points above. To think there is anything sinister about this is to be completely ignorant of the problems older people deal with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absurdist&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;dystopia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-governor Sarah Palin of Alaska has perhaps &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2009/08/07/palin/index.html"&gt;the wildest claim&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s “death panel” so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their “level of productivity in society,” whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care reform is going to affect all of us, and the only way to have a rational discussion and to come to some agreement as a nation is to work from facts.  The bill isn’t written in some impenetrable gibberish: it’s fairly plain English.  If you hear wild claims, go to the text to see if it bears them out.  Remember than everyone—&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;—has a stake in this, beneficent, sinister, or neutral.  Judge, write, speak out, but do so as an informed citizen.  In science-based medicine, propaganda is the enemy, truth the most important tool.&lt;/p&gt;

The Spitzer Space Telescope &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/news/spitzer-20090810.html"&gt;has detected signs&lt;/a&gt; of an interplanetary smashup, and oh, what a colossal event it was… apparently, 100 light years away around the young star HD 172555, &lt;strong&gt;an object the size of the Moon slammed into a planet the size of Mercury!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the way cool animation they created portraying the event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/xvc7Wf1xj4c%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did they figure this out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomers used Spitzer to take infrared spectra of HD172555, a young star only a few million years old. By breaking up the light into a spectrum, you can determine what elements and molecules are in the light’s source (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/04/lcross-detects-life-on-earth/"&gt;I’ve written about this sort of thing before&lt;/a&gt;). When astronomer Carey Lisse looked at the spectrum from the star, he got a shock: it was a mess. His team finally figured out what they were seeing: amorphous silica, and lots of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glass?&lt;/em&gt; From a star?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely explanation is that the glass is in the form of tektites, which are blobs of glassy material that form when something big hits something else big. The silica gets fused into glass. But that means that there was a pretty big impact that must have happened at that star, and that in turn means that two planet-sized objects must have had a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad day. This was supported by the detection of other chemicals consistent with the aftermath of a massive collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best fit to the data suggest that one object was planet-sized and the other Moon-sized, meaning the collision would have been at very high speed — several kilometers per second — and launched an unimaginable amount of material into space. Furthermore, it couldn’t have happened too long ago, or else the material would have dissipated and wouldn’t have been seen. It looks like this was a recent event, then, occurring maybe only a few thousand years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s another thing that I find personally very cool. Remember, HD 172555 is only 100 light years away. That is extremely close on a galactic scale (our galaxy is 100,000 light years across, so this star is our next door neighbor). It seems incredibly unlikely that this is a rare event in the galaxy, since this happened so close by and so recently. It’s far more likely that it happens all the time in young solar systems, which means it happened to us, too. Well, a long time ago, like 4 billion years ago when planet-sized objects were more common and still forming in our solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it lends credence to the idea that planetary-scale collisions do happen. We know this already, of course, because we’re pretty sure the Moon formed when a Mars-sized object smacked into us over 4 billion years ago, and we see evidence of vast impacts on other bodies in the solar system as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to see evidence of it around another star, with different conditions, means this sort of thing is common, and is an inevitable step in the process of solar system formation. The Universe is a violent place, but every day it looks more likely that violence is necessary for us to be here at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure there’s a lesson in there worth extrapolating, but it’s certainly an interesting thing to be reminded of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. The animation above is cool, but not a perfect representation of what happened. For example, the shock wave ring travels around the planet as shown, but when the ring converges on the point opposite the collision point, there would be a huge explosion and a vast plume of material launched into space. No one ever puts that in their animations, and I think it would be very cool! I need to get people who create physics-based simulations to make one that’s accurate, so it can be used in situations like this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249930836102"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_7.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f90cf44f75cf1c7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'09 Interviews"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline'09 - interview with Danica Radovanovic</title><published>2009-08-10T17:46:46Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T17:46:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/lrPqY9shTZg/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_7.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/scienceonline09_-_interview_wi_7.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;The series of interviews&lt;/a&gt; with some of the participants of the 2008 Science Blogging Conference was quite popular, so I decided to do the same thing again this year, posting interviews with some of the people who attended &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/a&gt; back in January. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Danica Radovanovic from the &lt;a href="http://www.danicar.org/" title=""&gt;Digital Serendipities&lt;/a&gt; blog (you can also find her on her &lt;a href="http://www.danicar.org/sr/" title=""&gt;Serbian blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/author/danica-radovanovic/" title=""&gt;Global Voices Online&lt;/a&gt;) to answer a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="danica pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/danica%20pic.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I'm a web activist, practitioner, social media researcher and observer, information management professional, project manager, PhD scholar, global nomad. It is hard to define or label myself, synthesize what I do as I'm pretty much interdisciplinary. One of my friends, prof. from Berkeley would say (joking or not) that I'm a spiritual scientist, seeing me in academia. Others would label me as super dragon woman in her practical work attacking the tasks. But the fact is my work in the last twelve years would be the closest to information science, web of science, communication studies, social media, humanities, web publishing, open access intertwined with web activism and web pioneering. My background is in humanities, philology sciences, LIS, publishing, information science, communications, cybernetics later, but I've been always curious about social implications of Web and online media. I've been pioneering many web projects in Serbia starting from the first academic mailing list in 90's, electronic magazine in the beginning of '00 (funny there is still a trace about this &lt;a href="http://www.sk.co.yu/2001/09/skin03.html%22%22" title=""&gt;on this URL&lt;/a&gt;), comparative research on e-publishing in academia, open access using data from my US research studies, founder of the first science blog in Serbia (&lt;a href="http://kobson.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;KOBSON&lt;/a&gt;), faught for the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/06/do_serbian_scientists_need_a_b.php%22%22" title=""&gt;existence of this science blog&lt;/a&gt;, attended many local and international conferences, held sessions, talks, wrote and published many columns, was editor of open access database for Serbia, was a lecturer at School of Web journalism, and many other things that cannot fit this page. At this moment my life and work are pretty much dynamic, have to update all pages and services with new info ::smile::. More about my digital identity and beginnings on &lt;a href="http://danicar.wetpaint.com/page/My+Virtual+ID%2FEntity+-+Short+story" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last decade I found myself global nomading since I created my life to be a great adventure with unknown next destination. I've been living, travelling, working, studying both in Europe and United States. I've been blessed to interact, collaborate, work with fantastic people that supported me to put my ideas into action. My current work is based in Rome, Italy where I work for United Nations on the interesting projects dealing with the future web, semantic metadata systems, projects within EU and other international science and tech bodies. Beside my practical work - I want to keep up with my research, and I've been lucky to get into the Oxford Internet Institute where I'm a PhD scholar for 2009/2010, and in Fall I am moving on with my research right to OII.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An astronaut ::giggle::  But realistically I would go now for a pilot flying licence for smaller planes, that's more down to earth. Also, when I was a kid I wanted to be cybernaut [greek word cybernao - to govern] and when I saw the first Commodore 64, I dropped the idea of having a bike, but rather a computer, so I wanted to be computer cybernaut and to do something futuristic, wether it is travelling to cosmos or creating super interesting things on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
My real life job is creating super interesting things on the computer and the Web ::smile::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been so lucky to be invited by United Nations to join the Department that deals with Knowledge and capacity building, semantic web, science and technology. My colleagues are very supportive and we are creating new projects with other scientific and tech institutions and universities world wide. I am currently working on one that is based in Europe and covers science, education, technology, web of science, bioethics, etc. Working in brilliant surrounding I am learning every day from super smart people but also I have a freedom and flexibility to do whatever I want within my area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People ask me every day how did the heck I get to UN, and I usually say that has to do with serendipities and my belief that the knowledge is the power. It is a story about being in the right place at the right time.  After ScienceOnline conference in January 2009, I got back to Belgrade and gave a few lectures on social networks for the School of Web Journalism, when my current colleague/supervisor asked me for an interview offering me a job. After fifteen minutes of teleconference talk we've clicked and I've been asked to move to Rome within two weeks. The rest is &lt;a href="http://www.danicar.org/2009/02/21/i-am-joining-un-in-march/" title=""&gt;all written on Digital serendipties&lt;/a&gt;. I can say from this point of view, ScienceOnline09 helped me to reinvent new curiosities for science and tech and I carried around positive, good spirits from the event. So things just happened. I am very thankful for this fantastic opportunity I was given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I'm pretty much interdisciplinary in my approach to research and practice, since my work is oriented towards: social web, social media, social networks, open access, metadata, semantic web, web of science, web anthropology, linked data, information science, communications, virtual communities, web publishing, eLearning practices, metadata, semantic web. All these are occupying my mind and projects in the last few years, as they are intertwining at certain points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a blogger since 2003. I started to blog during my time at UNC-Chapel Hill and I've been blogging ever since. I blog in English since majority of my friends and colleagues are English speakers and Serbian is my native language. It's one of the ways to express myself, practice my written word, interact with the people who are reading my words and giving me the constant feedback in digital or analogue world. My blog is the hugest social network for my friends, allies as on one place there is info that one needs to know: on my current projects, plans, adventures, rants, reflections, links to the social software I use, and other musings. I do blog about social media, technology, information and life. Some of the material I blog I use as well for the articles, papers I publish or as initial idea for my presentations and lectures, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding social networks: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/DanicaR" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and Friendfeed I use every day, most of the time. Friendfeed and Twitter helps out in my work as there is a group of people with whom I exchange information and share it with others, comment on some issues, interact. I have to admit that I'm somewhat a Twitter addict, actually texting, and from its early beginnings I did silly things twittering from wherever I was, airplanes, unreachable places, broadcasting conferences, being in dangerous or funny situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook and I have an interesting history. Before massive madness I actually got my job in 2006 thanks to Facebook. Back then I had only academic folks and close friends as contacts. Now everyone wants to be Facebook "friend" with me, and I refuse to "friend" anyone who doesn't write in a note if we've met before somewhere at some conference, any other affiliation space or situation.  If someone writes that is my blog fan and what I write helps her/him out at the studies, or makes a comment on something I wrote - I cannot say "no". This refers to others social networks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I'm just trying to reduce the information noise. The same refers to Twitter: my attention span on Twitter is short so there are friends I know for years I don't follow and they are OK with that as we can meet whenever and chat. I may not follow thousands of people but I always reply/react to an interesting tweet. That's why I have a separate Twitter protected account for friends and family.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Thanks to you I discovered science blogs three years ago, and ever since I'm following your blog regularly. From the people who attended the conference  - I like to read &lt;a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/" title=""&gt;Bjoern Brembs&lt;/a&gt; blog, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/" title=""&gt;Greg Laden'&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/" title=""&gt;John Dupuis'&lt;/a&gt;s blog, and many others within ScienceBlogs network. I've discovered few new interesting science blogs of &lt;a href="http://theoystersgarter.com/" title=""&gt;Miriam Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://zelnio.org/" title=""&gt;Kevin Zelnio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://southernfriedscience.com/" title=""&gt;Andrew Thaler'&lt;/a&gt;s as marine and ocean blogging is like watching discovery oceanographic adventures but in words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
I enjoyed the entire conference, especially interacting with people in between the sessions. Two sessions I found very interesting for my work and research was extensive conversation on open access moderated by &lt;a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/" title=""&gt;Bjoern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sennoma.net/" title=""&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; and presentation by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/" title=""&gt;John Wilbanks&lt;/a&gt; from Science Commons on semantic web in science.  I think in the future conferences these two sections that are discussing the current issues should not be omitted as they are curating and shaping the science 3.0. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are you currently working on?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am finalizing a part of the major project I'm on since March this year. At the moment it is work on application profiles that involves social networking aspect  (people + connections) using FOAF as a base (geeks know whats FOAF - &lt;a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/" title=""&gt;machine readable ontology&lt;/a&gt;). I have full freedom in creating it, and beside people in-house, I do collaboration and consultations with the ingenious people and the creators of this project. I keep up with my UN job as it is very challenging for me in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I should be writing and finishing before departing for Oxford, a book (in co-authorship) for web journalists in Serbia. This will be my contribution to Serbian media regarding social web. My chapters in the book are covering topics such as: Web 2.0, social media software and tools for web journos, the special chapters on Social networks (Facebook and Linkedin), blogs, and Micro-blogging (Twitter), social marketing, etc. All this I have to finish before Oxford, and beside that I have zillion other tasks so this summer for me is working summer.  I hope to catch up a few days of so needed vacation and to get the energy for Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's your PhD research about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My PhD research is focused on exploring communication practices in the social networks, virtual communities, particularly on Facebook and young adults in Serbia, in specific media and conversation practices. I want to examine how young adults move between online and offline worlds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one so far examined how new digital media performances are embedded in a broader sociocultural and education frameset in Serbia, I want it to explore, so in the Fall I am finally returning back to my PhD research that I've put aside because of work. I am blessed and lucky to &lt;a href="http://www.danicar.org/2009/07/23/i-will-be-joining-oxford-internet-institute-this-fall/" title=""&gt;get the Oxford Internet Institute fellowship&lt;/a&gt;, which is giving me the great opportunity to collaborate with fantastic people in social media and interwebs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you. You and Anton organized a superb conference. I hope to see you and other people next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m taking today off work after having been on the road for nine of the past ten days.  For you, that just means I have the time to write up a quick post about the Secular Student Alliance Conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Highlights of the trip:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Seeing 50 people turn out to hear my new boss, &lt;strong&gt;Sean Faircloth&lt;/strong&gt;, speak in Cincinnati.  I had expected closer to 20, so the crowd was exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Visiting the Creation Museum.  I was stunned that they made no secret about their hostility toward human reason.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img title="CreationFolly2" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/CreationFolly2.jpg" alt="CreationFolly2" width="500" height="296"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sorry this picture is a bit blurry, but smoke would rise from my camera every time I used flash.  No joke.  I need a new camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Having my lobbying training workshop go well.  I’ve never given this particular presentation, but I’m hoping to get more practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Looking around the room and seeing the current leaders of the movement, and then reflecting on the fact that I was sitting with the future leaders as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Meeting various internet personalities in person.  I’d met Hemant before, but not &lt;strong&gt;Ashley &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/healthyaddict"&gt;healthyaddict&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;Jen &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/"&gt;BlagHag&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;strong&gt;PZ Myers &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;).  If I’m missing some, let me know!  I know a lot of the students have blogs, and I would love to see what everyone else thought of the conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Going out drinking with the fellow conference-goers.  I feel so at home in a dive bar discussing morality while finishing off the fourth pitcher of beer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Sleeping in dorms again.  It’s a sparse, Spartan existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Listening to Sean give a passionate speech and seeing the students fired up.  Some even gave him a standing ovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Hearing &lt;strong&gt;Dan Barker&lt;/strong&gt; (of FFRF) talk about how lucky he is to be one of the few “professional atheists” in the country – and realizing that I’m one, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;PZ Myers’ talk.  More on it later, but when you get a positive shout-out from PZ Myers – by name, no less – it’s strangely satisfying.&lt;img title="Galef_PZ_500x324" src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Galef_PZ_500x324.jpg" alt="Galef_PZ_500x324" width="500" height="324"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;More drinking and partying. I enjoyed talking to PZ about his family and his background in computer programming.  I have never been more willing to share my Cap’n Morgan than when it’s PZ asking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt;Going back to the dorms at 2:30 AM – and hearing later that my boss was out later than I was.  Way to make me feel lame, Sean.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a blast and encourage everyone to sign up for conferences like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm careful to put the title in quotes, because it is not a museum in any respectable sense of the word. I knew this ahead of time; I had no expectation of any kind of credible presentation in this place, but what impressed me most is how far it failed to meet even my low hopes. They clearly want to ape a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; museum,  but they can&amp;#39;t — their mission is the antithesis of open inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guards are a clear example. Real museums have guards, of course: they're there to protect valuable exhibits from theft and vandalism. But real museums want their guards to be discreet and not interfere with the attendees appreciation of the exhibits. At the Creation "Museum", one of the jobs of the guards is to suppress criticism. They hover about in rather conspicuous uniforms, armed with tasers, and some use police dogs to check out the visitors.  They don't want dissent expressed in their building, and 
&lt;a href="http://blogs.answersingenesis.org/aroundtheworld/2009/08/08/the-day-285-atheistsagnostics-visited-the-creation-museum/"&gt;they admit it themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of mocking inside the museum Friday (and to a lesser extent during Dr. Jason Lisle's noon lecture) by dozens of the 285 in the SSA group, and some of the mocking could be clearly heard by many of our guests (especially in our Noah's Flood rooms, but also in the Garden of Eden exhibit when words like "garbage" were uttered, etc.). Several times during the day we had to ask mockers to keep their voices down (I did it five times myself), but generally, it was more peaceful than what we expected (many blog comments from those who were coming were promising some very aggressive actions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the genuine museums you might have visited. Can you imagine the curators at the American Museum of Natural History being concerned that someone might openly disagree with an exhibit? Do you think Niles Eldredge bustles about the museum, shushing anyone who questions the displays? Would they turn away a visitor wearing a Jesus shirt, or one that baldly declared evolution is false? At real museums, the attitude would range from indifference to active encouragement of discussion. The Creation "Museum" cannot tolerate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were asked to sign a document before we entered that required us to be "respectful" of their facilities, which apparently meant more than simply appropriately regarding their building as private property. One of our atheists was in an entirely friendly conversation about evolution with a creationist visitor, when one of the guards came up and asked them to stop, saying that we had signed an agreement not to even &lt;i&gt;discuss&lt;/i&gt; anything in the building where others could hear. (To his credit, the creationist said that he welcomed the discussion the guards wanted to silence, and they continued outside.) They knew we disagreed with them, and they were clearly on edge…and they knew that their beliefs could not stand up in the face of free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other differences with real museums once we got inside. Think about the layout of serious museums, like the AMNH or the Smithsonian or our local Bell Museum: you enter, there are various rooms and areas organized by subject matter, but you&amp;#39;re free to explore. In fact, that word, &amp;quot;explore&amp;quot;, is a central theme of most museums. Maybe it&amp;#39;s unfair to compare a small potatoes, non-science affair like Ken Ham&amp;#39;s building to major scientific institutions; it&amp;#39;s more of a place for family entertainment. So compare it to the Pacific Science Center, or OMSI, or the Franklin museum or the Science Museum of Minnesota— places where kids come on field trips and families show up with  5-year-olds, and entertainment is a major function. Exploration is still the byword, and they also emphasize interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/7cs1.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/7cs-thumb-175x200-17211.jpeg" width="175" height="200" alt="7cs.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Ham&amp;#39;s Creation &amp;quot;Museum&amp;quot; does none of that. They have a script you&amp;#39;re supposed to follow. There is a single route that snakes through the building with a series of exhibits with a linear agenda. You are supposed to get their Sunday School lesson plan of the 7 C&amp;#39;s (creation, corruption, catastrophe, confusion, Christ, cross, and consummation). Exploration is not an option. You will follow their track. There is no interactivity, either — it&amp;#39;s a chain of displays, dioramas, and little scenes, supplemented with frequent videos that tell you what to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not a museum: it is a haunted house. It is a carnival ride. It shows throughout in the layout — the rubes are supposed to be shuttled through efficiently, get their little thrills, and exit so the next group can make the trip. If they&amp;#39;d had a few million more, I imagine they would have invested in tracks and little cars and turned it into the Creation Ride. The creators of this place wouldn&amp;#39;t recognize a museum if they woke up in the middle of the Smithsonian on a bed of museum maps with a giant sign saying &amp;quot;MUSEUM&amp;quot; in front of their faces and an army of docents shouting directions at them. They seem to have gotten all their information about how a museum works by visiting Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the scientific content? They must have made some kind of argument, right? Wrong. They didn't even try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/samefacts.jpeg" width="400" height="121" alt="samefacts.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is their core premise. They &lt;i&gt;claim&lt;/i&gt; that scientists and creationists are all working from exactly the same set of facts, and the only difference is in how we interpret them…and that they have an extra source of information that scientists reject, the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/twoviewsdiorama.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/twoviewsdiorama-thumb-200x132-17216.jpeg" width="200" height="132" alt="twoviewsdiorama.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their first big exhibit is a perfect example of the principle in action. It's a model of a dinosaur dig, with two men working away at excavating the bones. There is a video accompanying it in which the two views are presented. The younger Asian fellow in front says, and I paraphrase, "This animal died about a hundred million years ago. Its body dried in the sun for several days before being slowly buried under layers of sediment in a local flood." Then the avuncular creationist says, "I see the same bones, but I believe this dinosaur was killed suddenly about 4400 years ago in a huge global flood, which buried it deeply all at once." And then he goes on to explain that see, they have the very same evidence, but he understands it in the light of God's word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a profoundly dishonest display. No, they are not using the same evidence: the creationist is &lt;i&gt;ignoring&lt;/i&gt; all but the most superficial appearances. The scientist says a few details about this particular dinosaur, but what Ken Ham hides is that &lt;i&gt;every statement would have a large body of evidence in its support&lt;/i&gt;. This isn&amp;#39;t two guys stating their mere beliefs in a field…it&amp;#39;s one guy, the creationist, closing his eyes to the evidence and spouting Biblical gibberish, and one scientist stating the conclusions of substantial investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientist does not say a particular fossil is 125 million years old simply because he feels like it. It&amp;#39;s a conclusion built on careful observation of the geology — if you read a paleontology paper, you&amp;#39;ll often find a substantial discussion of the details of the rocks surrounding the specimen — and by the morphology of the rocks, the history of the area, the physics of the radioisotopes present, the other animal and plant fossils found in the same plane (which, in turn, had their ages evaluated). It is the product of an impressive consilience of evidence, all of which the creationist is rejecting, or more likely, of which he is utterly ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's part of our problem in getting the message of science out. In this video, the white-bearded creationist speaks calmly, acts like a pleasant and reasonable fellow, and appears capable of tying his own shoes. But if you know even a scrap of the actual science being misrepresented, you know that he's an ignorant fool who is telling lies to children, and he transforms instantly from Santa Claus to predatory propagandist. I think that's what they actually mean by "same facts, two views".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/human_reason_gods_word.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/human_reason_gods_word-thumb-200x277-17220.jpeg" width="200" height="277" alt="human_reason_gods_word.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an ongoing theme throughout the &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; that there are these two views in opposition, and it&amp;#39;s often stated quite unashamedly that the conflict is between God&amp;#39;s word and…&lt;i&gt;human reason&lt;/i&gt;. It's also quite clear that human reason is the enemy to Ken Ham and his crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This display is a beautiful example of their tactics, though. I had come to this place expecting a &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gish_gallop"&gt;Gish Gallop&lt;/a&gt; of misdirection, in which they'd hurl a barrage of half-truths, out-of-context information, and outright lies about the science at the viewer, which usually puts the informed critic in the position of having to struggle with correcting point after point, each one requiring more time to address than the creationist spent asserting it. This place is very different. Instead, we get a Ham Hightail, in which he hurtles along heedlessly pretending that the evidence simply doesn't exist, so he doesn't need to argue against it, and it's enough to back up his claims by quoting Bible verses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it works well for the gullible attendees, but for those of us looking for some ideas with which to wrestle, the impression left is one of credulous vacuity. It's an &lt;i&gt;empty&lt;/i&gt; "museum", with no real ideas, no evidence, just a collection of props to illustrate an unquestioned myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/creo_tree.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/creo_tree-thumb-190x200-17223.jpeg" width="190" height="200" alt="creo_tree.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they do make plain statements that contradict the science, they don't bother to provide a &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt; to accept their view over the scientific one — reason is the enemy, you may recall. It&amp;#39;s enough to simply declare that this is &lt;b&gt;GOD'S WORD&lt;/b&gt;, therefore it is true. Never mind that it is only one narrow interpretation of their god's awesomely vague words, that many of their fellow Christians can interpret it differently, or that the evidence of nature (which, presumably, is their god's creation) says something completely different. It is simply no problem to declare that human affinities to other animals are not real, we are unique and unchanging, and that divergence (of a very limited sort) only happens to animals. It is a simple-minded absolutism that relies on ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; actually spends more time condemning heretics than it does science, which, as I said, is mostly ignored. I was rather amused to discover several prominent exhibits frothing madly over Charles Templeton —&lt;s&gt; I almost felt some sympathy for his foundation, since they get hammered from all sides. Almost.&lt;/s&gt; (Never mind, wrong Templeton. The exhibits do no refer to the founder of the Templeton Foundation, but to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Templeton"&gt;apostate Canadian author and cartoonist&lt;/a&gt;…not to say anything against the fellow, but it&amp;#39;s even weirder that he was given such prominence here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/templeton_sign.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/templeton_sign-thumb-200x178-17227.jpeg" width="200" height="178" alt="templeton_sign.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/templeton_timeline.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/templeton_timeline-thumb-200x152-17230.jpeg" width="200" height="152" alt="templeton_timeline.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/millions.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/millions-thumb-160x200-17233.jpeg" width="160" height="200" alt="millions.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One mantra was repeated over and over: &amp;quot;millions of years&amp;quot;. This is also the enemy, an idea whose sole purpose is to undermine their literalist interpretation of scripture. In several places there are little tirades against the whole concept that the world could be more than 6,000 years old — it&amp;#39;s bad, not because there are problems in the evidence supporting an old earth, but simply because it would have the unfortunate consequence of opening the Bible up to interpretations other than their rigid formulation. They had a lovely symbolic representation of this idea with a wrecking ball labeled &amp;quot;MILLIONS OF YEARS&amp;quot; demolishing a church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason is an enemy, millions of years is an enemy, let's add another: reality is their enemy. No wonder they're so paranoid!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/eve_adam.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/eve_adam-thumb-200x132-17236.jpeg" width="200" height="132" alt="eve_adam.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the museum consists of little more than pretty affirmations. The various exhibits that have gotten a fair amount of press, such as the models of Adam and Eve, the construction of the Ark, the consequences of the Fall, etc., etc., etc., just sit there. There isn&amp;#39;t any evidence for them, other than a few sentences in an old book, so the construction crews in Kentucky just let their imaginations run loose and built improbably scenes out of the fabric of quaint myths. But there they are, solid and visible, and that&amp;#39;s their sole purpose — to solidify Bible scenes in the minds of the faithful. This stuff has all the verisimilitude and significance of a wax museum exhibit of Britney Spears, Queen Elizabeth, and Liberace…more emptiness, with much money spent to make it a &lt;i&gt;pretty&lt;/i&gt; void. There is a great deal of useless noise in this theme park…well, useless in making a defensible argument, at any rate. This is all eye candy for the believers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/ark1.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/ark-thumb-302x200-17247.jpeg" width="302" height="200" alt="ark.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/suffering.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/suffering-thumb-169x200-17258.jpeg" width="169" height="200" alt="suffering.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some jarring moments. A lot of effort is spent discussing how &lt;i&gt;horrible&lt;/i&gt; the consequences of the &amp;quot;millions of years&amp;quot; worldview are, yet they rather blithely skip over the horrible consequences of their imaginary god&amp;#39;s actions. The space dedicated to Noah&amp;#39;s Ark and the flood is very large — it might be the largest section of the &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; — and the grim horror of that story is treated callously. A diorama contains, rendered in loving detail, a few rocks in a rising sea covered with desperate people struggling and frantically waving to the Ark serenely gliding by. Ah, yes, a little hint of the joys of heaven, when the saved will be able to smugly watch the suffering of sinners in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an appalling video recreation of the flood which shows children playing and villagers going about their business in a small ancient town, when suddenly an immense wall of water rises on the horizon, and then…the roar of the tidal wave and the screams of the doomed. Charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think I like these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also a bit aghast at this display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/hamite.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/hamite-thumb-337x200-17254.jpeg" width="337" height="200" alt="hamite.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With complete seriousness and no awareness of the historical abuses to which this idea has been put, they were promoting the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham"&gt;Hamite theory of racial origins&lt;/a&gt;, that ugly idea that all races stemmed from the children of Noah, and that black people in particular were the cursed offspring of Ham. If they are going to reject science because of its abuses, such as eugenics, they should at least be conscious of the evils perpetrated in the name of their strange cultish doctrines, I should think.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Again, though, there's &lt;i&gt;absolutely no science&lt;/i&gt; in any of this — every conclusion is built exclusively on an idiosyncratic interpretation of the Bible. There is nothing at all for a scientist anywhere in this entire edifice. There is nothing for anyone other than a fundamentalist Christian who has bought into a great deal of presuppositionalist nonsense, either.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17607_p2.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/aftereden4b.jpeg" width="200" height="234" alt="aftereden4b.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last example of this irrational absurdity. This is a strange thing: they seem to take pride in their boldness of stating this idea, making comics about it and even selling t-shirts in their store that declare it. They have an answer for where the sons of Adam and Eve got their wives, and they are quite definite about it. They married their sisters. And that was all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they might be disappointed to know that I find nothing shocking about their conclusion. What I find terrible is their rationale, which they explain at some length in this ugly wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/cain1.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/cain-thumb-290x200-17244.jpeg" width="290" height="200" alt="cain.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, no science anywhere in there, just reasoning after the fact from a pre-determined conclusion. Everything written in the Bible must be literally true, so since 1 Corinthians and Genesis teaches that Eve was the mother of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; people, no other interpretation is possible but that Cain had to marry another child of his mother and father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is excuses, claiming that since they were genetically perfect, inbreeding wouldn't have been a problem, and most amusingly, it was OK because God said so. Anything god says is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since God is the One who defined marriage in the first place, God's Word is the only standard for defining proper marriage. People who do not accept the Bible as their absolute authority have no basis for condemning someone like Cain marrying his sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no rational argument that can address the claims of a group of people who claim absolute authority from an invisible man whose voice is heard only in their heads. We cannot change their minds with science; if you think you can sit down with a genetics text and a paleontology text and a geology text and run through the evidence and expose the foundations of the Creation &amp;quot;Museum&amp;quot; as false, you&amp;#39;re doomed — there is no rebuttal to the illusion of an omniscient authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also not make headway by coddling religious belief or respecting their delusions. I recalled this quote while I was there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American scientific community gains nothing from the condescending rhetoric of the New Atheists--and neither does the stature of science in our culture. We should instead adopt a stance of respect towards those who would hold their faith dear, and a sense of humility based on the knowledge that although science can explain a great deal about the way our world functions, the question of God's existence lies outside its expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;Mooney and Kirshenbaum, &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt;, 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what Ken Ham wants. He demands that you &lt;i&gt;respect&lt;/i&gt; his ideas, and he certainly does hold his faith dear. His whole premise in his theme park is to amplify uncertainty about science, to insist that scientists must be more humble, while asserting absolute certainty about the existence of his god, and that his belief is the sole explanation for all natural phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t give it to him. All his carnival act deserves is profound disrespect and ridicule. Go to his &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; as you would to a cheap freak show, and laugh, laugh, laugh…and go home to publicly mock and heap scorn upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irreverence is our answer, not dumb humble deference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night of Tuesday/Wednesday August 11/12, the annual Perseid meteor shower will peak. If you find a dark spot and go out after midnight, you should see up to 60 or so meteors zinging across the sky per hour. This year is not as great as previous years, since the Moon will be up almost all night and washing out the sky somewhat, but if you make the effort I’m sure you’ll see quite a few shooting stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 2007 Perseids I wrote up a post called &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/08/09/12-things-you-need-to-watch-the-perseid-meteors-sunday-night/"&gt;12 Things You Need To Watch the Perseid Meteors&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing really important has changed since then, so reading that will give you a good guide on what you need to do if you want to watch the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that has changed since then, though, is the advent of Twitter! It has a lot of uses, including those  astronomical and meteorical: the Newbury Astronomy Society has started &lt;a href="http://newburyas.wordpress.com/2009/08/03/twitter-meteorwatch"&gt;Twitter Meteorwatch&lt;/a&gt;, where you can follow the Perseids online, get links to live webcams, and ask questions about the shower as well. Just use the hashtag #Meteorwatch when tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in observing the shower, I urge you to find groups going out; it’s more fun with lots of people, and it’s easier to stay awake. &lt;a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/organizations"&gt;Sky and Telescope’s website has a searchable list of clubs and organizations&lt;/a&gt; so you can find out who’s near you. Added bonus: Jupiter is up all night, so if you’re with a group of folks with telescopes you’ll get to see one of the best sights in the sky. Bring binoculars if you have them too; they’re easy to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perseids are a great way to get kids into astronomy, and a wonderful way to spend an evening. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249926420558"><id gr:original-id="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/08/sedentary-behavior-sleep-and-obesity-in.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3653eb0d9748c96b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sedentary Behavior, Sleep, and Obesity in Children</title><published>2009-08-10T11:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T11:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/YU4iS0JBsSA/sedentary-behavior-sleep-and-obesity-in.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.obesitypanacea.com/2009/08/sedentary-behavior-sleep-and-obesity-in.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">It has been reported that up to 16% of children have a hard time falling asleep, resulting in shorter sleep duration.  That might not seem like such a big deal, but an increasing number of studies have report that decreased sleep time is a risk factor for obesity.  Although the idea is still quite controversial, it is has been suggested that insufficient sleep is likely to affect the hormones that regulate hunger, resulting in increased food intake, and eventually obesity.  Reduced sleep time has also been associated with reduced cognitive performance. So in general, we want to make sure that kids are getting enough sleep, but how can we do that?...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

But probably to a limited number of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's more fun to know how scientists got those facts - their thoughts, motivations and methods. How they did it. Why they did it. Where did they get the idea to do it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's even more fun, for a broader number of people, if that finding is placed in a historical context - how work of previous generations of scientists, meandering around various age-specific ideas, led to the work of this particular group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is even more fun watching the historians of science at work. Most recent science is pretty easy to figure out. But going into the past, it gets harder and harder. The unit of information today is the peer-reviewed scientific paper in a journal that is for the most part easily obtainable online. But in the past, books were more important. The standards of evidence were not as stringent. The various pseudoscientific and borderline scientific ideas were mainstream. Many scientific findings were made by adventurous explorers, not people with long and sophisticated scientific training. The line between science and fiction was not very clear. While today English is the language of science, in the past many languages were used, and not everyone could read all of them. Transport of books around the world was slow and difficult. Plagiarism was harder to detect, thus rampant. History of science, and even more the work of science historians, reads like a detective thriller! Now that's exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I regularly read John McKay at &lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Archy&lt;/a&gt;, who is a professional historian, slowly working on his book. And occasionally putting some of the essays on his blog for the commenters to help with corrections, ideas and additional information. See his latest output - all riveting reads:&lt;/p&gt;

to think historically about what science communication is, and how it has changed over time (due in significant part to changing communication technologies), I had them all read Chapter 8 of a fascinating little book entitled the &lt;a href="http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/sketch.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, penned in 1794 as the French Revolution turned bloody by one of the last of the philosophes, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet"&gt;Marquis de Condorcet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Sketch &lt;/em&gt;is Condorcet’s grand and impassioned argument for why science and reason must triumph in the long term against superstition and tyranny, and its author hangs much of the case on the power of one particular communication technology–the printing press. In particular, Condorcet’s Chapter 8–really, his “Eighth Stage,” as the book is organized in “Stages” along the path to full enlightenment–is entitled “From the invention of printing to the time when philosophy and the sciences shook off the yoke of authority.” It contains some powerful stuff; here are a few passages.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, I like to think of myself as being far more &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; science- and evidence-based medicine, than I am against against so-called "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even though the proportion of medical therapies not based on science is &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=51"&gt;far lower than CAM advocates would like you to believe&lt;/a&gt;, there are still more treatments in "conventional" medicine that are insufficiently based on science or that have never been validated by proper randomized clinical trials. This is true for some because there are simply too few patients with a given disease; i.e., the disease is rare. Indeed, for some diseases, there will never be a definitive trial because they are just too uncommon. For others, it's because of what I like to call medical fads, whereby a treatment appears effective anecdotally or in small uncontrolled trials and, due to the bandwagon effect, becomes widely adopted. Sometimes there is a financial incentive for such treatments to persist; sometimes it's habit. Indeed, there's an old saying that, for a treatment truly to disappear, the older generation of physicians has to retire or die off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why I consider it worthwhile to write about a treatment that appears to be on the way to disappearing. At least, I hope that's what's going on. It's also a cautionary tale about how the very same sorts of factors, such as placebo effects, reliance on anecdotal evidence, and regression to the mean, can bedevil those of us dedicated to science- and evidence-based medicine just as much as it does the investigation of CAM. Moreover, it's a story that I first encountered four years ago and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/02/avoiding_scientific_delusions.php"&gt;wrote about at that time&lt;/a&gt;. As such, writing a followup on it is one of the advantages of having been blogging for nearly five years now. It's one of those times when blogging is very satisfying, because it allows me to follow the development of of a story over years and comment on developments as they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest wrinkle should serve as a warning to those of us who might feel a bit too smug about just how dedicated to SBM modern medicine is. What will physicians do with the most recent information from very recently reported clinical trials that clearly show a very favored and lucrative treatment does not work better than a placebo?&lt;/p&gt;

The source suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Perhaps soon, archeologists will discover an even older LOLcat on the walls of an Egyptian tomb… perhaps a cat with the caption, &amp;quot;I see what you did there!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems to me that if there are Egyptian (or Sumerian, or Mayan, or Mycenean, or Etruscan, or …) LOLcats, they&amp;#39;ve probably already been dug up and are now lying on some dusty museum shelf, waiting to be revealed to the world by a scholar who reads Language Log.&lt;/p&gt;

This treatment appeals to women who want a more natural or gentle approach to their symptoms. Unfortunately, as the latest research shows, it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in herbal medicine has increased in the last 15 years as a response to weakened regulation and a successful marketing strategy by the supplement industry in the context of a cultural phenomenon of changing attitudes toward medicine. This has mainly led to, however, confusion about what herbal therapy really is. Most people I talk to think of herbal treatments as natural supplements – but they are not supplements and being “natural” is irrelevant. In fact it is much more accurate to think of them as unpurified drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botanical research is a legitimate and useful branch of pharmacology, with its own experts. The plant kingdom is a vast chemistry laboratory, specializing in chemicals that have some effect on other living things. The process of experimentation through evolution is slow, but has had hundreds of millions of years to operate. As a result we are surrounded by plant-based chemicals – some benign, most toxic, and a few with pharmacological properties we can exploit to our advantage if we’re careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That these chemicals are “natural” is meaningless. Beyond the fact that the term in this context has no useful operational definition, that these chemicals exist in nature should give us no comfort. They exist for the survival of the plant, mostly at the expense of animals who might want to eat it. No plant evolved to be a useful medicinal for one egocentric mammalian species. Toxicity, however, is all about dose, and in essence all useful drugs are simply toxins with a dose range in which they have an effect that can be exploited with acceptable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, plants have dozens or hundred of chemicals in them, and these vary in different parts of the plant, in different times of the season, in different regions, and from year to year. They are very dirty drugs, with variable doses of potentially useful but also strictly harmful substances. Botanical pharmacology focuses on identifying useful plants, and then figuring out which chemical substances in them are useful and which are simply adding toxicity. Useful chemicals can then be purified, quantified, and studied for their biochemistry and net health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a hard time understanding why someone would want to treat themselves with a dirty herb containing highly variable doses of multiple chemicals, rather than a precisely known quantity of a specific chemical with known properties. The justification I am almost always given is because they are “natural” – but as I pointed out, this is no justification at all, but clever marketing bordering on mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one saving grace of herbs is that the doses of most chemicals within them is likely to be low and therefore below the level of toxicity – or any useful effect, either. This does not mean their safety can be assumed, and many herbal remedies have been found to have toxicity, (like &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5147a1.htm"&gt;kava kava and liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.smw.ch/docs/archive200x/2003/11/smw-10204.html"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt; from a variety of botanicals) or to interfere with prescription drugs (so-called drug-drug interactions – because they’re drugs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once modern pharmacology came into its own our accumulated wealth of botanical knowledge was raided for useful drugs, and they now comprise the majority of the drugs we use today. We have already plucked the low hanging fruit. There are likely to still be useful drugs out there in the plant kingdom, but it will take some investigation and research to find them. Such efforts are ongoing, and will likely continue to feed pharmacy shelves for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the herbal remedies that have come into popular use are generally not the result of investigation and careful research, but either tradition (read anecdotes) or modern marketing masquerading as tradition. For example, echinacea may have been used by Native Americans for many things (as was tobbaco, incidentally) but they &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/353/4/337"&gt;did not use it for the common cold&lt;/a&gt;. That use was an invention of a German herbalist who used the Native American angle for marketing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not a surprise that the herbs most commonly marketed today for common ailments (read large customer base) have mostly failed in clinical trials. Gingko does not work for memory or mental focus, echinacea does not treat the common cold or its symptoms,  and St. John’s Wort has minimal to no effect on depression. Black cohosh for menopausal symptoms was held up as an herbal remedy that actually works, but now we have evidence from a double-blind trial that is clearly negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/160177.php"&gt;This trial had four arms &lt;/a&gt;- including black cohosh, red clover, placebo, and standard hormonal therapy. They followed women with menopausal symptoms for 12 months and found that, over time, they all had a decrease in symptoms by 34, 57, 63  and 94 percent respectively. The black cohosh and red clover were not statistically significantly different from placebo, while the hormonal therapy was significantly improved from placebo. The primary weakness of the study, which was generally well designed, was that it enrolled only 89 women – this is enough to run meaningful statistics, but is smallish for a clinical study of this type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also examined memory in the subjects and found no difference again among black cohosh, red clover, and placebo and a slight negative effect from hormonal therapy. So – standard hormonal therapy works, with a slight side effect on memory. The botanicals black cohosh and red clover had no detectable effects or side effects – not surprising. No one study is ever the final word on questions of clinical safety and efficacy – but the trend for research into popularly marketed herbs is definitely negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, raises many questions about regulation and research. The current regulation in the US is abysmal – botanical drugs are treated as if they were vitamins, and companies can even make pseudo-health claims for them (so-called structure-function claims), while having no obligation to prove safety. Research is now often funded by the NCCAM, which &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=574"&gt;recently came under criticism&lt;/a&gt; for spending 2.5 billion dollars of tax payer money over the last decade and having nothing to show for it. This might have something to do with using politics to create a center specifically to bypass the usual methods of deciding what is useful to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said – botanical research is already a separate and useful branch of pharmacology that can be funded through other centers at the NIH. In fact this legitimate research is marginalized when brought under the umbrella of “alternative medicine” – another marketing term with no useful definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that quality clinical research into the effectiveness and safety of commonly used herbal remedies is being done. This research recently has largely been negative, which is not surprising given the history and nature of many of the products being studied. The bad news is that common use, regulation, and marketing are almost completely divorced from the scientific research.What, then, one might wonder, is the purpose of the research?&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/09/like-the-fist-of-an-angry-god/"&gt;I wrote about a weird event at Saturn&lt;/a&gt;, where some object apparently blasted through Saturn’s rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only cool thing that’s happened out there. As I mentioned in that post, Saturn’s rings are almost exactly edge-on to the Sun, meaning that anything that sticks out above the phenomenally flat rings will cast a long, long shadow. We’re seeing more and more of that as the rings aim themselves at the Sun — with them being &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; aligned with the Sun — the Saturnian equinox, as it were — on August 11, tomorrow! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now there are wonders to behold. Saturn’s narrow F ring, outside the main A ring, has been getting tortured, twisted, manipulated by the gravity of nearby moons. Whenever some event or another moves particles in the rings above or below the ring plane, they cast one of these reaching shadows. We’re so close to the equinox now &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5756/Shadow_Reaches_A_Ring"&gt;that shadows fall a long way indeed&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view_media/28435/Shadow_Reaches_A_Ring"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/cassini_fring_aring_shadow.jpg" alt="Shadows stretches across Saturn’s rings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check that out! Whatever that lump is that you can barely see in the F ring (I marked it with an arrow to help you see it), it’s casting a shadow &lt;em&gt;over 5000 kilometers long&lt;/em&gt; — the width of the entire United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow is a little faint, but that’s because Cassini was looking at the unlit side of the rings, so we’re in essence seeing this shadow literally &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the rings themselves. Had the spacecraft been on the other side, the shadow would have been a lot more obvious. Incidentally, Cassini was almost 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from the shadow when it took this image; that’s four and a half times the distance of the Moon from the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image was taken on July 30, still two weeks before the equinox. What will we see on that exact moment, when the Sun shines straight down the knife-edge of the rings? A dozen shadows of moons as they circle hundreds of thousands of kilometers outside the rings?

This treatment appeals to women who want a more natural or gentle approach to their symptoms. Unfortunately, as the latest research shows, it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in herbal medicine has increased in the last 15 years as a response to weakened regulation and a successful marketing strategy by the supplement industry in the context of a cultural phenomenon of changing attitudes toward medicine. This has mainly led to, however, confusion about what herbal therapy really is. Most people I talk to think of herbal treatments as natural supplements – but they are not supplements and being “natural” is irrelevant. In fact it is much more accurate to think of them as unpurified drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botanical research is a legitimate and useful branch of pharmacology, with its own experts. The plant kingdom is a vast chemistry laboratory, specializing in chemicals that have some effect on other living things. The process of experimentation through evolution is slow, but has had hundreds of millions of years to operate. As a result we are surrounded by plant-based chemicals – some benign, most toxic, and a few with pharmacological properties we can exploit to our advantage if we’re careful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That these chemicals are “natural” is meaningless. Beyond the fact that the term in this context has no useful operational definition, that these chemicals exist in nature should give us no comfort. They exist for the survival of the plant, mostly at the expense of animals who might want to eat it. No plant evolved to be a useful medicinal for one egocentric mammalian species. Toxicity, however, is all about dose, and in essence all useful drugs are simply toxins with a dose range in which they have an effect that can be exploited with acceptable side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, plants have dozens or hundreds of chemicals in them, and these vary in different parts of the plant, in different times of the season, in different regions, and from year to year. They are very dirty drugs, with variable doses of potentially useful but also strictly harmful substances. Botanical pharmacology focuses on identifying useful plants, and then figuring out which chemical substances in them are useful and which are simply adding toxicity. Useful chemicals can then be purified, quantified, and studied for their biochemistry and net health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a hard time understanding why someone would want to treat themselves with a dirty herb containing highly variable doses of multiple chemicals, rather than a precisely known quantity of a specific chemical with known properties. The justification I am almost always given is because they are “natural” – but as I pointed out, this is no justification at all, but clever marketing bordering on mythology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one saving grace of herbs is that the doses of most chemicals within them is likely to be low and therefore below the level of toxicity – or any useful effect, either. This does not mean their safety can be assumed, and many herbal remedies have been found to have toxicity, (like &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5147a1.htm"&gt;kava kava and liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.smw.ch/docs/archive200x/2003/11/smw-10204.html"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt; from a variety of botanicals) or to interfere with prescription drugs (so-called drug-drug interactions – because they’re drugs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once modern pharmacology came into its own our accumulated wealth of botanical knowledge was raided for useful drugs, and they now comprise the majority of the drugs we use today. We have already plucked the low hanging fruit. There are likely to still be useful drugs out there in the plant kingdom, but it will take some investigation and research to find them. Such efforts are ongoing, and will likely continue to feed pharmacy shelves for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the herbal remedies that have come into popular use are generally not the result of investigation and careful research, but either tradition (read anecdotes) or modern marketing masquerading as tradition. For example, echinacea may have been used by Native Americans for many things (as was tobbaco, incidentally) but they &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/353/4/337"&gt;did not use it for the common cold&lt;/a&gt;. That use was an invention of a German herbalist who used the Native American angle for marketing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not surprise that the herbs most commonly marketed today for common ailments (read large customer base) have mostly failed in clinical trials. Gingko does not work for memory or mental focus, echinacea does not treat the common cold or its symptoms,  and St. John’s Wort has minimal to no effect on depression. Black cohosh for menopausal symptoms was held up as an herbal remedy that actually works, but now we have evidence from a double-blind trial that is clearly negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/160177.php"&gt;This trial had four arms &lt;/a&gt;- including black cohosh, red clover, placebo, and standard hormonal therapy. They followed women with menopausal symptoms for 12 months and found that, over time, they all had a decrease in symptoms by 34, 57, 63  and 94 percent respectively. The black cohosh and red clover were not statistically significantly different from placebo, while the hormonal therapy was significantly improved from placebo. The primary weakness of the study, which was generally well designed, was that it enrolled only 89 women – this is enough to run meaningful statistics, but is smallish for a clinical study of this type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also examined memory in the subjects and found no difference again among black cohosh, red clover, and placebo and a slight negative effect from hormonal therapy. So – standard hormonal therapy works, with a slight side effect on memory. The botanicals black cohosh and red clover had no detectable effects or side effects – not surprising. No one study is ever the final word on questions of clinical safety and efficacy – but the trend for research into popularly marketed herbs is definitely negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, raises many questions about regulation and research. The current regulation in the US is abysmal – botanical drugs are treated as if they were vitamins, and companies can even make pseudo-health claims for them (so-called structure-function claims), while having no obligation to prove safety. Research is now often funded by the NCCAM, which &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=574"&gt;recently came under criticism&lt;/a&gt; for spending 2.5 billion dollars of tax payer money over the last decade and having nothing to show for it. This might have something to do with using politics to create a center specifically to bypass the usual methods of deciding what is useful to research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said – botanical research is already a separate and useful branch of pharmacology that can be funded through other centers at the NIH. In fact this legitimate research is marginalized when brought under the umbrella of “alternative medicine” – another marketing term with no useful definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that quality clinical research into the effectiveness and safety of commonly used herbal remedies is being done. This research recently has largely been negative, which is not surprising given the history and nature of many of the products being studied. The bad news is that common use, regulation, and marketing are almost completely divorced from the scientific research. What, then, one might wonder, is the purpose of the research?&lt;/p&gt;

I was told that I am unusually smart and gifted. Whether or not this is true, it has given me a deep-seated expectation of myself to do great(ish) things, to achieve a bit more than the average Joe, to stand out from the crowd, to gain recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people of course achieve very little that is noteworthy beyond the solid humble everyday victories of a quiet life. I'm sure that most people do not have a sense that this is in any way insufficient. I'm also sure that many of these average achievers have talent and potential far beyond that needed to live a standard life. They just don't expect of themselves to do any more than the average person. I believe they are by and large content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills and training I have are not much sought after. There is very little professional demand for me. This clashes badly with my grandiose ideas about myself. I achieve things that I am proud of on a small one-man-project scale, but few care, and I gain little recognition. I am frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m thinking that maybe it isn&amp;#39;t such a good idea to tell your kids they&amp;#39;re anything else than just plain Joe &amp;amp; Jill. Because regardless of how talented (or not) they are, it is clearly possible to live a happy life without standing out in any way. It might be better for the &lt;i&gt;world&lt;/i&gt; if every talented person were encouraged to achieve their maximum. We'd get more scientific breakthroughs, more great art and music, more just and competent leaders that way. But it is probably not in general good for people to be thus encouraged, since most will still not achieve much -- only feel the expectation to do so. What good does it really do me, for instance, to believe that I should be a university lecturer and head projects involving thirty people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. A child of sub-average or average talent will almost certainly not be happier if they grow up to believe that they should be able to accomplish great things. But nor will in most cases a child of &lt;i&gt;above-average&lt;/i&gt; talent. Because smart people are a dime a dozen. There isn't any great demand for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/08/chasing_after_the_wind.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/pIS1yaj9MVo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249902732160"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2009/08/sunday-protist-ebria.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/46845074f74f7896</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sunday Protist - Ebria</title><published>2009-08-10T05:32:54Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T05:32:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/H4hjxRYSJoU/sunday-protist-ebria.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2009/08/sunday-protist-ebria.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Someone here wanted Ebriids and Ellobiopsids. Since I&amp;#39;m still in a bit of Rhizarian mood, let&amp;#39;s do Ebriids first. Just as you thought we couldn&amp;#39;t get any more obscure than Phaeodaria...Ebriids are biflagellate Cercozoans (see the Pawlowski &amp;amp; Burki 2009 Rhizaria tree in the Coelodiceras post for their phylogenetic neighbourhood) with a characteristic silica endoskeleton, permanently condensed nuclear chromatin and lack of cell wall or scales. They are rare and still unculturable, so very little is known about them. The taxon name derives from ebrius (&amp;#39;drunken&amp;#39; lat.) as they apparently swim in a strange fashion. (Hoppenrath &amp;amp; Leander 2006 Protist)They feed on diatoms and dinos, likely using pseudopodia in their feeding (an interesting feature of Cercozoans is their affinity for pseudopodia despite being flagellate...) Interestingly, they too, like some dinos, can devour diatom chains in a process that seems similar to palium feeding. Due to their silicoflagelate nature, they have been caught up in the taxonomic chaos and have been considered to be dinos or radiolarians; they were thrown around between the two for decades, until the eerie Enlightenment through molecular biology placed them in Cercozoa. (all from Hoppenrath &amp;amp; Leander 2006)(Hoppenrath &amp;amp; Leander 2006; arrow in A points to nucleus; scalebar: 10μm)The silica endoskeleton leaves behind a nice fossil record stretching back to the Cretaceous, although very few modern species have been found (Hargraves 2002 Plankton Biol).(Korhola &amp;amp; Grönlund 1999 J Paleolimnol. Silica Ebriid skeletons from Baltic sediment)I wonder if their genomes too conceal some quirky stuff. Permanently condensed chromosomes tend to do that (see dinos; Euglenids have them too but nothing seems to be known about their genomes yet).A bit tired and sleepy... apologies for low energy post today.---As for &amp;quot;just why is everything about dinoflagellates just so *%&amp;amp;$ing weird?&amp;quot;* - Simple. On the 7th day of creation, the intelligent designer took a break, got really high off some awesome shit he&amp;#39;d just finished creating, and made the protists. Dinos were created near the climax of his hallucinations, while ciliates were definitely made right AT the climax. Thus, ciliates are the Higher Eukaryotes, with dinos and the rest of Protista close behind. Now for a reading from the Book of Tom... oh, has anyone tried that while &amp;#39;under influence&amp;#39;? Does it help?*In case some are as clueless about dinos as I was less than a year ago, the following is some of the oddities:Nucleus- permanently condensed chromatin- massive genomes (&amp;gt;10x that of humans)- chromosome structure on crack- mandatory trans-splicing of 5&amp;#39;-cap-bearing splice leaders onto mRNA transcripts. Ie each mRNA transcript must have another specific mRNA sequence attached to its beginning, otherwise it gets degraded. Interestingly, Trypanosomes and some genome in C.elegans do that too, and have polycistronic genes, which is highly unusual for eukaryotes. Ie. several genes following one promotor... more on that later sometime!Mitochondria- tiny genomes- rRNA assembled from fragments, some of which are imported from the nucleus- some species: single gene linear chromosomes; some have long scrambled repeating permutations of three conserved mitochondrial genes (COX1,3; COB)- post-transcriptional RNA editing; ie a transcript is made, and then some bases are modified prior to translation- trans-splicing (of exons located on different loci) (usually splicing happens in cis, by remvoing a region between two exons; trans-splicing involves taking two exons from different regions and gluing them together. Plastids- single-gene minicircles - genome consists of tiny circles usually containing a single gene and a replication origin sequence.Misc- closed mitosis (Nu envelope doesn&amp;#39;t break apart; although not that unusual)- prone to tertiary endosymbiosis (eg. Karlodinium, Karenia, Kryptoperidinium, Lepidodinium, Dinophysis)- diversity of lifestyles, from endo- and ectoparasitism and endosymbiosis to myzocytosis (sucking prey through a &amp;#39;straw&amp;#39;) to palium-feeding; all while roughly half of them are photosynthetic- Warnowiid dinos with... camera eyes!Since it&amp;#39;s kinda late and I&amp;#39;m sleepy and don&amp;#39;t have time to reference all that... let&amp;#39;s just pretend this footnote never happened, k? ^_~  I should blog about this properly later...---Hoppenrath, M....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Dear Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an atheist who became an atheist after getting a job working for a church. I enjoy my work and it is well paying with good benefits (something I need as my wife has had many health problems). My job is not really religious in a major way. I do mostly clerical work. Yet, I still feel like a hypocrite. I do look for other jobs, but have not been successful so far. Should I come out even if it would cost me my job? Do you have any advice on not feeling like a hypocrite every day? Thanks for your help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. My wife knows about my atheism. She was happy when I ‘came out’ to her as she only went to church on my account. She considers herself a deist.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two issues to sort out here which may overlap: Hypocrisy about your beliefs, and deceiving your employers in order to safeguard your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it’s a credit to your character that the mere possibility of your being a hypocrite concerns you.  Sadly, many people don’t give such things a second thought.  However, simply being concerned is not enough to be assured that your character is strong and intact.  I follow the maxim, “You are what you do,” meaning that a person’s character is indicated by the persistent patterns of their actions, rather than by their thoughts or words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s first look at the possibility of hypocrisy and see how much, if any, fits what you persistently do:  The simplest description of hypocrisy is not practicing what you preach, or asking others to do something that you are not willing to do.  You say that your job is not really religious in a major way, that you mostly do clerical work.  It would seem to me that when you are doing clerical work, you’re not “preaching” or directly promoting a belief in others that you do not share.  So when you are doing those clerical things, you are not being a hypocrite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However,&lt;/em&gt; it’s not clear from your letter what the “religious” part of your job entails, if anything.  If in that part you directly promote in others belief in God and that church’s religion while you do not personally have that belief, then to that extent you are being a hypocrite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there’s the issue of deceiving your employers to safeguard your job.  You are at least passively deceiving them and your co-workers who are probably assuming that you still share their beliefs. If in conversations you pretend to still be a believer, then your deception is also active, and involves lying.  Unfortunately, many people have to keep secrets or even lie to their employers because of prejudice against things that have nothing to do with their work.  So an electrical engineer or an insurance salesman might keep their atheism a secret from their prejudiced boss.  I don’t see an ethical conflict in that because they are simply avoiding trouble that is not related to their work duties, and they’re working within a system that would penalize them unfairly if they were open about their beliefs.  As long as they have been honest about their qualifications to do their work, and are honest about the actual execution of that work, then they are acting in an ethically sound manner, and other issues are nobody else’s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the other hand,&lt;/em&gt; if you were originally hired on the condition that you are a believer in God and that particular religion, then having lost that belief, you do have an ethical conflict because you now no longer fulfill that condition.  It can be argued that a church clerical worker should not have to be a believer, but in the strictest sense, in the pickiest sense, I think it’s an ethical conflict.  I’m only being this picky to clarify the ethical issues. You seem to be a good, decent man, and yet in this particular area, it’s possible that you’re also being somewhat deceitful and dishonest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you do about that, if anything, probably will depend on how much it bothers you, if at all.  Life puts us into many ethical dilemmas. Sometimes we have to make tough choices, and at other times we have to make compromises.  We make those compromises as small as possible, trying to avoid building up large collections of rationalizations, which are good-sounding reasons for doing bad things. In the three-dimensional world, we have to find a workable balance between scrupulous honesty and self-forgiveness.  We have to make judgment calls and accept responsibility for the consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, my impression of you is that the small amount of hypocrisy inherent in whatever are your specifically religious duties at the church, (if any) and the mild to moderate ethical problem of deception for the sake of keeping your job may be minor dilemmas, but they are probably going to pester your conscience just enough to keep you less than happy while working there.  That is an effective way to never be very successful in your work.  The pay is good, and the benefits are important for your wife’s health needs, but that unhappiness may prevent you from excelling at your job, and you’ll get stuck at close to your present level.  I can’t tell from your letter how old you are, so I don’t know if this job is one of your first or perhaps one of your last, so the success issue may be irrelevant.  But either way, being constantly uncomfortable and having to be secretive and pretending for so many hours a day sounds like a pain in the neck.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve offered a couple of rationalizations that might “get you off the hook” with the hypocrisy and deception questions, but for a man with a strong and watchful conscience like yours, they’ll only work if you actually think they are valid rationalizations.  If you do, great.  Glad I could help.  But only you know the decisive details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If not,&lt;/em&gt; then I suggest that instead of “coming out,” you quietly increase your efforts to find similar clerical work in a secular setting, or get some training or education to open up a wider range of work opportunities. Take your time, but not too much time, and find a well-paying, good benefits-giving job elsewhere that allows you to be more relaxed and open about being you.  In the long run, you’ll be more successful and more satisfied, a happier worker and a happier husband. &lt;/p&gt;

I assume you mean "It's always the highly reputable sellers who get 'attacked.'" Back it up with evidence or withdraw it as specious. Second, what does "Highly Reputable" have to do with anything? It's not like a skeptic is going to buy a Haunted Carpathian Spider Vampire from moonstar; it's only you gullible dipshits who will toss money down that bottomless pit, and since you believe in the first place, &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; you'll be Very Satisfied Customers.

Some sellers (mostly the reputable ones) have taken the high road and not resorted to name calling and accusing people of fraud.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Damn, the woos are fighting it out tooth and nail over on eBay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When you are selling DVD players, you can't say that your biggest competitor is selling fake DVD players, easy to disprove.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"It's got Sony guts, I swear."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That's why calling a MP seller a fraud is effective.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I will take this as tacit admission that one cannot disprove the claims of the sellers, and their claims are therefore unfalsifiable and therefore useless. Also, "metaphysics" is one word. "MP" mean "Magic Points," "Mana Points," or "Military Police."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Try asking your dragon to stand there, hold his vessel and pose for a photo. I doubt mine would.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Those invisible, incorporeal, cold-fire-breathing dragons sure are stubborn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people aren't happy unless they're miserable, and you don't know who these people are that write those pages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm a skeptic. I'm twenty-six. I have a degree in philosophy and am working on another in anthropology. I work nights. I like video games, White Wolf's World of Darkness, Mel Brooks comedies, and pizza. I'm allergic to just about anything with fur. When I was fifteen, I snuck into a taping of &lt;i&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/i&gt;. If you met me in person, you'd think nothing at all was unusual about me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, I did go through a period of only being happy when I was miserable. It was called "adolescence," and I've been over it for quite some time. Your &lt;i&gt;ad hominem&lt;/i&gt; does not render my (admittedly very snarky) criticisms invalid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ignore it, stick with who you trust, that's what I do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Don't follow the evidence. Feel it out. Nice people are awesome."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The frauds will eventually get bitten by karma.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sure, no human action is needed. Just let the universe sort itself out and don't report anyone to a consumer protection website. Mysterious forces will see that they drive off a cliff, and that's how we'll know they were frauds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And the people who started this war (those who took the low road), look at their sales some time and see how well their auctions are going since they started spending their time trying to discredit others as opposed to focusing on their business and their craft (if they ever had one).&lt;/blockquote&gt;How to maintain a belief structure in three steps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step one: assume all criticism comes from other sellers. &lt;br&gt;Step two: assume "reputable" sellers do not engage in any criticism. &lt;br&gt;Step three: It therefore follows that all sellers who don't make much money are engaging in criticism, and thus the "anonymous" critics can be identified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy peasy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It's very eye opening.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If that's how you want to look at it, be my guest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I guess I needed to vent a bit on this too, since I've never chimed in on the subject before.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Your venting was as useful as that of a busted, leaky air conditioner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/Sn_qbbHS9DI/AAAAAAAAAuE/SkVkDHjGYbs/s1600-h/Moonstar6.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:104px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/Sn_qbbHS9DI/AAAAAAAAAuE/SkVkDHjGYbs/s400/Moonstar6.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have a devata from Rhonda...

Like yesterday. Because you're all fucking bonkers. You think that bulk-order jewelry is conscious and fun to hang out with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know what? I've changed my mind. Don't seek help. Leave the house. Go to a restaurant or a bar or a concert or a sporting event. Meet and interact with real people. Make some friends. Eventually, once you have a good crew of folks around you, you'll realize how empty self-delusions are, how pathetic and miserable it was to pretend that your only friend was a sterling silver and cubic zirconium tchotcke with the imbued consciousness of some misbegotten and misunderstood mythical beast while reinforcing your delusion by chatting online all day with similarly empty people.

In other words, we are far more for science-based medicine, than we are against against so-called “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM). My perspective on the issue is that treatments not based on science need to be either subjected to scientific scrutiny if they have sufficient prior plausibility or strong clinical data suggesting efficacy or abandoned if they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even though the proportion of medical therapies not based on science is &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=51"&gt;far lower than CAM advocates would like you to believe&lt;/a&gt;, there are still more treatments in “conventional” medicine that are insufficiently based on science or that have never been validated by proper randomized clinical trials than we as practitioners of science-based medicine would like. This is true for some because there are simply too few patients with a given disease; i.e., the disease is rare. Indeed, for some diseases, there will never be a definitive trial because they are just too uncommon. For others, it’s because of what I like to call medical fads, whereby a treatment appears effective anecdotally or in small uncontrolled trials and, due to the bandwagon effect, becomes widely adopted. Sometimes there is a financial incentive for such treatments to persist; sometimes it’s habit. Indeed, there’s an old saying that, for a treatment truly to disappear, the older generation of physicians has to retire or die off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why I consider it worthwhile to write about a treatment that appears to be on the way to disappearing. At least, I hope that’s what’s going on. It’s also a cautionary tale about how the very same sorts of factors, such as placebo effects, reliance on anecdotal evidence, and regression to the mean, can bedevil those of us dedicated to SBM just as much as it does the investigation of CAM. It should serve as a warning to those of us who might feel a bit too smug about just how dedicated to SBM modern medicine is. Given that the technique in question is an invasive (although not a surgical technique), I also feel that it is my duty as the resident surgeon on SBM to tackle this topic. On the other hand, this case also demonstrates how SBM is, like the science upon which it is based, self-correcting. The question is: What will physicians do with the most recent information from very recently reported clinical trials that clearly show a very favored and lucrative treatment does not work better than a placebo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story that illustrates these issues, fresh from the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/research/06spine.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new studies cast serious doubt on a widely used and expensive treatment for painful fractures in the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment, vertebroplasty, injects an acrylic cement into bones in the spinal column to ease the pain from cracks caused by osteoporosis, the bone-thinning disorder common in older people. Doctors began performing it in this country in the 1990s, patients swore by it — some reporting immediate relief from terrible pain — and it soon caught on, without any rigorous trials to determine whether it really worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new studies are exactly the kind of research that health policy experts and President Obama have been calling for, to find out if the nation is spending its health care dollars wisely, on treatments that work. A bill passed by Congress this year provides $1.1 billion for such so-called comparative effectiveness research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies of vertebroplasty, being published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found it no better than a placebo. But it remains to be seen whether the findings will change medical practice, because they defy the common wisdom and challenge a popular treatment that many patients and doctors consider the only hope for a very painful condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the two studies in question, and they were published in last week’s &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. Whenever a journal as prestigious and widely read as the NEJM publishes two studies of the same clinical question in the same issue, as companion studies, it’s trying to send a message. This time, the message is loud and clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/6/569"&gt;Kallmes DF, Comstock BA, Heagerty PJ, Turner JA, Wilson DJ, Diamond TH, Edwards R, Gray LA, Stout L, Owen S, Hollingworth W, Ghdoke B, Annesley-Williams DJ, Ralston SH, Jarvik JG (2009). A randomized trial of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic spinal fractures. New Engl. J. Med. 361:569-579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/6/557"&gt;Buchbinder R, Osborne RH, Ebeling PR, Wark JD, Mitchell P, Wriedt C, Graves S, Staples MP, Murphy B (2009). A randomized trial of vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. New Engl. J. Med. 361:557-568&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the meat of the studies, let’s take a look at what vertebroplasty is. Vertebral fractures in patients with osteoporosis represent a very difficult problem to deal with. The reason is that they can be extremely painful and, worse, very difficult to get to heal using conventional methods. Indeed, the pain can be so severe that powerful narcotics are the only thing that can control it. Given that it can sometimes take months for such fractures to heal (if they heal at all), “conservative” treatment is not very satisfactory. Not surprisingly, a search for treatments that could decrease the disability, pain, and even death from these fractures was imperative. Years ago, a procedure known as percutaneous vertebroplasty, which involved the injection of polymethylmethacrylate directly into the vertebral compression fracture under the guidance of fluoroscopy, was first reported. Initial anecdotal reports suggested a very rapid and effective relief of pain after the procedure. The other aspect of vertebroplasty that led physicians to believe that it could work to relieve pain from compression fractures is that the technique had some degree of prior plausibility. The concept was that the injection of cement into the fracture would provide rapid stabilization of the fracture and therefore rapid relief of pain. It’s never been proven that that is the mechanism, but, according to the principles of prior plausibility, there was at least a reasonable hypothesis as to how vertebroplasty might stabilize fractures and relieve pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look at the introduction of Buchbinder &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies suggest that there is an immediate and sustained reduction in pain after this procedure is performed,5 but data from high-quality randomized, controlled trials are lacking. The best currently available evidence for the efficacy of vertebroplasty comes from one randomized, open trial involving 34 patients and two quasi-experimental, open, controlled, before–after studies that compared vertebroplasty with conservative treatment. Although each study showed an early benefit of vertebroplasty, methodologic weaknesses cast doubt on the findings. In particular, the lack of blinding and the lack of a true sham control raise concern that the observed benefits reflected a placebo response, an effect that may be magnified with an invasive procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this sound familiar? For long-time readers of SBM, it should. I’ve written about it before, as have others, in two contexts. First, consider acupuncture. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=492"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=500"&gt;time again&lt;/a&gt;, we have pointed out how acupuncture studies tend to be positive for early, smaller, less rigorously controlled studies but in larger and better-controlled studies the observed treatment effect disappears. This sort of progression is very typical for interventions that don’t produce an effect that is measurably greater than that of a placebo. And it is this sort of progression that appears to have occurred for vertebroplasty. Indeed, look at this &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/health/28spine.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; article from four years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is sure why it helps, or even if it does. The hot cement may be shoring up the spine or merely destroying the nerve endings that transmit pain. Or the procedure may simply have a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some research hints that the procedure may be harmful in the long run, because when one vertebra is shored up, adjacent ones may be more likely to break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vertebroplasty and a similar procedure, kyphoplasty, are fast becoming the treatments of choice for patients with bones so weak their vertebrae break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two procedures are so common, said Dr. Ethel Siris, an osteoporosis researcher at Columbia University, that “if you have osteoporosis and come into an emergency room with back pain from a fractured vertebra, you are unlikely to leave without it.” She said she was concerned about the procedures’ widespread and largely uncritical acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? If not, consider this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I struggle with this,” said Dr. Joshua A. Hirsch, director of interventional neuroradiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He believes in clinical trials, he said, but when it comes to vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, “I truly believe these procedures work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I adore my patients,” Dr. Hirsch added, “and it hurts me that they suffer, to the point that I come in on my days off to do these procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again does this sound familiar? How many times have we heard the same sorts of quotes from CAM practitioners? Dr. Hirsch apparently started with the noblest of motives, wanting to relieve his patients’ unremitting pain from spinal metastases due to cancer or fractures due to osteoporosis. He still believed in 2005 that he was helping; otherwise he would probably have abandoned vertebroplasty. Many CAM practitioners start out similarly, no doubt. They come up with a method or a treatment, see what appears to be a good result, become convinced that it works, and thus become true believers. The difference is that, as an academician Dr. Hirsch at least felt uneasy about advocating this therapy without adequate research or strong objective evidence to show that it really works better than a sham procedure, because doing so goes against his academic training. Nonetheless, Dr. Hirsch convinced himself by personal observation and small pilot studies that the procedure works, even though before the studies I’m about to discuss the evidence supporting vertebroplasty was actually very similar to the state of evidence for acupuncture in that the best evidence for the efficacy of vertebroplasty were two unblinded trials comparing vertebroplasty with medical management. Not surprisingly, they were positive trials showing a benefit for vertebroplasty over medical management. That the the Director of Interventional Neuroradiology at Massachusetts General Hospital could convince himself that an unproven treatment works on the basis of personal observation and small pilot studies simply shows how easy it is to persuade oneself to believe what one wants to believe, no matter how scientific one views oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then comes hard, cold science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is a multi-institutional study (Kallmer &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;) involving five centers in the United States, five centers in the United Kingdom, and one center in Australia, led by David F. Kallmes, M.D. at the Mayo Clinic and Jeffrey G. Jarvik, M.D., M.P.H. at the University of Washington. According to the methods, “sites were selected on the basis of having an established vertebroplasty practice for osteoporotic fractures, an enthusiastic local principal investigator, and an available research coordinator.” The study was designed as a randomized, controlled, study, in which the experimental group underwent standard vertebroplasty, while the control group underwent a sham procedure in which local anaesthesia was infused, and verbal and physical cues, such as pressure on the patient’s back, were given. To complete the sham, the methacrylate monomer normally used to make up the glue was opened to simulate the odor associated with mixing of the cement. However, the vertebroplasty needle, the needle was not placed and the cement was not infused into the frature. Patients with fractures due to bone metastases, bleeding disorders, and a few other criteria were excluded. Overall it was a sound design, but the investigators had trouble recruiting patients to the trial. Indeed, the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/health/28spine.html"&gt;NYT article from 2005&lt;/a&gt; describes just this for Dr. Jarvik’s trial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, a group of researchers received a federal grant for a clinical trial that would be the first to rigorously assess vertebroplasty. But their study is faltering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in severe pain have proved unwilling to enter such a trial, in which they might be randomly assigned to get a placebo, and their doctors have been reluctant to suggest it. In 18 months, the investigators have been able to persuade just three medical centers to recruit patients, and only three patients have enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the investigators are looking for centers overseas, but they agree that the study’s prospects are dim and that its failure would leave critical questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whose responsibility is it to decide that something should be part of medical practice without adequate evidence that it works?” asked Dr. Jeffrey G. Jarvik, an investigator with the study and a neuroradiologist at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose indeed? Once a belief has taken hold that a procedure works, it’s sometimes hard to persuade patients and physicians that a randomized study is ethical. Imagine how hard a sell this study would be to a patient at the apogee of pain from a compression fracture. That’s why there was a crossover design, in which patients, after one month, were allowed to crossover to the other group if they did not have adequate pain relief at one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this study was a resoundingly negative study. There were 131 patients enrolled (68 vertebroplasties and 63 simulated procedures), and the two groups were well matched. Both groups noted immediate and comparable improvement in disability and pain scores immediately after the intervention. At one month, there was no statistically significant difference between the control and vertebroplasty groups. The only hint of a possible effect is that there was a trend towards a higher rate of clinically meaningful reduction in pain in the vertebroplasty group, although, quite frankly, this result strikes me as a bit of the old trick of looking at multiple outcomes, trying to find one that comes out statistically significant. Let’s put it this way. This study is about as “positive” as any of the acupuncture studies we’ve dissected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study (Buchbinder &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;) was performed in Australia by a group led by Rachelle Buchbinder, Ph.D. It, too, was a multi-institutional study, with a control group that underwent vertebroplasty. The sham procedure was slightly different for this group, and, in my opinion, more rigorous. They underwent the same procedures as those in the vertebroplasty group up to the insertion of the 13-gauge needle, and to simulate vertebroplasty the vertebral body was gently tapped. As was done for Kallmes &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, the cement was prepared so that its smell permeated the room. Unlike Kallmes &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, there was no crossover was permitted in the design of this study. A total of 78 patients were enrolled and 71 completed the 6-month follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buchbinder &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; reported results that were just as unimpressive as those reported by &lt;em&gt;Kallmes et al&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, they were more so, so much so that I will quote the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertebroplasty did not result in a significant advantage in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; measured outcome at &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time point. There were significant reductions in overall pain in both study groups at each follow-up assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you say “placebo”? Sure, I knew you could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Dr. Jarvik, Dr. Buchbinder crunched the data, looking for any outcome that could be considered even trending towards positive. She found none. This was about as negative a study as you can imagine, even more negative than most studies of homeopathy and acupuncture. This study found zero evidence that vertebroplasty is anything more than an elaborate placebo. Like acupuncture and homeopathy, come to think of it, the only difference being that there was some degree of prior scientific plausibility. Prior plausibility made vertebroplasty worth studying; however, these two trials provide emphatic evidence that it does not work, so much so that it surprised the authors, even though the very reason that the study had been done was because of nagging doubts that reported results &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/05/vertebroplasty-healthcare-reform-business-healthcare-backpain.html"&gt;seemed too good to be true&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kallmes did the study because he always though the results reported for vertebroplasty seemed too good to be true–everyone got good results no matter how much cement was injected or what technique was used. And the mechanism through which vertebroplasty provided pain relief was a bit of a mystery. He figured if vertebroplasty was as good as promised, it would be easy to prove. He never expected results as stone cold negative as they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, quite true. If vertebroplasty worked so well, it shouldn’t have taken much of a randomized trial to show it.  If there’s one principle in medicine and clinical trials, it’s that dramatic treatment effects are much easier to demonstrate than weak ones. If vertebroplasty was as potent a treatment as advertised, these two trials should have easily shown its benefits. They did not. Indeed, in last week’s &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/research/06spine.html"&gt;NYT article&lt;/a&gt;, there were a couple of more revealing quotes from the lead authors of these two studies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to be the most reviled radiologist on the planet,” said Dr. David F. Kallmes, the first author of one of the studies and a professor of radiology at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It does not work,” said Dr. Rachelle Buchbinder, a rheumatologist and epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and the leader of the Australian team. Dr. Buchbinder does not perform vertebroplasty and would “absolutely not” recommend it to patients, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kallmes, who helped develop vertebroplasty and has been performing it for 15 years, said his team was “shocked at the results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shock is understandable. As had been pointed out in both papers, vertebroplasty had become the standard of care for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Medicare and insurance companies had, on the basis of unblinded studies, begun to reimburse for the procedure. Dr. Burbacher put it well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that is acknowledged to be inadequate as a basis for justifying reimbursement, public institutions have recommended reimbursement for vertebroplasty. A recent position statement from various American radiologic and neurologic surgical societies also recommended funding the procedure.6 These endorsements have resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of vertebroplasties performed. For example, an examination of aggregate fee-for-service data from U.S. Medicare enrollees for the period from 2001 through 2005 showed that the rate of vertebroplasties performed during that time almost doubled, from 45.0 to 86.8 per 100,000 enrollees.14 There are also reports of repeat procedures for unrelieved pain at previously treated vertebral levels16 and of the prophylactic use of vertebroplasty in normal vertebrae that were deemed to be at high risk for fracture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is the short-term efficacy of vertebroplasty unproven, but there are also several uncontrolled studies suggesting that vertebroplasty may increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures, particularly in vertebrae that are adjacent to treated levels, sometimes after cement has leaked into the adjacent disk; controlled studies have shown conflicting results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, there’s money to be made. A lot of money. Combine that with “personal anecdotal experience” that suggests to both patients and the physicians who do the procedure that vertebroplasty “works,” giving interventional radiologists the feeling that they’re “doing good while doing well,” and you can see why the procedure’s use has taken off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about all the reports of dramatic pain relief from vertebroplasty? They’re &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=10"&gt;testimonials&lt;/a&gt;, of course. I’m going to go back to the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/health/28spine.html"&gt;2005 NYT article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jensen knows firsthand how powerful such stories can be. In the late 1990’s, when vertebroplasty was new and many doctors were looking askance at it, she gave a talk to a group of doctors in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I could tell by looking at the audience that no one believed me,” she said. When she finished, no one even asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a woman in back raised her hand. Her father, she told the group, had severe osteoporosis and had fractured a vertebra. The pain was so severe he needed morphine; that made him demented, landing him in a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he had vertebroplasty. It had a real Lazarus effect, the woman said: the pain disappeared, the narcotics stopped, and her father could go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was all it took,” Dr. Jensen said. “Suddenly, people were asking questions. ‘How do we get started?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after these two studies, there are patients who will not be convinced, as demonstrated in last week’s NYT article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One patient in the study, Jeanette Offenhauser, 88, said she was convinced that the cement had helped her severe back pain, even after hearing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that people often don’t realize and even physicians sometimes forget is that surgery and invasive procedures provide one of the most powerful placebo effects there is; so it is not surprising that a procedural intervention like vertebroplasty could appear effective at the anecdotal experience level. A lesson in history might be in order here. There was an operation that was popular in the late 1930s through the 1950s for treating angina due to coronary artery disease. It was called pericardial poudrage, and it involved opening the chest and sprinkling sterile talcum powder on the heart. The idea was that the inflammation would cause angiogenesis (the influx of blood vessels into the heart to revascularize it). We know today that the inflammatory reaction thus caused is far too minor to make up for the loss of blood flow from a major coronary artery. Still, patients reported marked improvement of their symptoms. It wasn’t until the 1950s that an actual randomized blinded trial (the patients could be blinded but the surgeons couldn’t) was performed. It found no difference between patients who had poudrage and those who just had their chests opened and closed. (Imagine trying to get that one through the IRB today.) In other words, poudrage was no different than sham surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it appears to be with vertebroplasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even doctors are having a hard time accepting these results. Even Dr. Kallmes himself argues that patients who want the procedure should still be able to get it, but only under the auspices of a clinical trial. That’s not entirely unreasonable, but Dr. Burbacher disagrees and says that these studies should be enough to abandon vertebroplasty. In an accompanying &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/361/6/619"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. James Weinstein of the Department of Orthopaedics, Dartmouth Medical School, argued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama has called for more comparative-effectiveness research as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Although clinical trials are an integral part of such research, from a safety and effectiveness standpoint, data from clinical trials combined with those from registries or other large longitudinal databases are necessary to provide the best evidence. Americans prize advances in technology. However, if in major medical challenges, such as osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, the alternative is to pay the cost of perpetual uncertainty, we need to support the research necessary to provide sufficient efficacy and safety information for patients to make a truly informed choice. Although the trials by Kallmes et al. and Buchbinder et al. provide the best available scientific evidence for an informed choice, it remains to be seen whether there will be a paradigm shift in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures with vertebroplasty or similar procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is indeed the question, isn’t it? Here’s the challenge. Given these two rather definitive randomized studies showing in essence no benefit for vertebroplasty over a placebo intervention, what will we as science-based physicians do? Will we abandon a procedure against which the evidence has been accumulating, culminating in two large randomized studies that found no real benefit in terms of pain relief? Unlike homeopathy, for instance, vertebroplasty has a complication rate. It’s low, but it’s there. Harm can be done, and these studies suggest there is no benefit to make the risks worthwhile. Or will we behave as CAM advocates behave and refuse to believe because we know from our own experience that it “works”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weinstein, ironically enough, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/research/06spine.html"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; what may well happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Dr. Weinstein, who does not perform vertebroplasty, suggested that rather than abandoning the procedure, doctors could let patients decide for themselves, by telling them, “This is a treatment option no better than a placebo, but if you want to consider a placebo because you might benefit from it, you might want to know that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $3,000 placebo? If given the choice between a pricey $3,000 placebo and a CAM placebo like acupuncture, which is likely to cost less than that and not have the potential for complications, I would pick the acupuncture, quite frankly, because the potential for harm is less than sticking needles into vertebrae and injecting cement. Really, if allegedly science-based practitioners make this sort of argument, then why not just offer CAM to patients as a placebo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my prediction. These studies will not be enough to change practice, at least not in the short term. Vertebral compression fractures are a serious problem for which other treatment options (bed rest, pain killers, and back braces while the fractures heal) are both slow and not palatable to patients or physicians, who want immediate results. However, unlike CAM practitioners, eventually physicians will yield to the weight of the negative evidence. There may be a few more studies, and it’s even possible that there may be found a subgroup of patients who actually do benefit from vertebroplasty, but eventually the procedure will either be abandoned or scaled back to patients who might actually benefit from it. The process may be far messier than we would like. It may take far longer than we would like. It may even take a turnover to a new generation of physicians for the process to be complete. But, make no mistake, science will win out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science-based medicine, in contrast to CAM, is inherently self-correcting. The problem is that we as science-based practitioners are just as prone to the same sort of thinking that causes CAM remedies that are no more effective than placebo persist against all negative scientific evidence. It’s a fact that we can easily forget if we are not careful. If we forget that we are just as prone to being fooled by personal anecdotal experience as any CAM practitioner, then we will be no different than they, the only difference being our choice of placebo-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

Talk to one person and your words are welcomed by a smile and nod of acknowledgment. Speak to another, less winsome listener and your words are confronted by a frown and folded arms. According to Camiel Beukeboom, these different responses systematically alter your use of language. Speak to a positive listener and you'll likely use more abstractions and subjective impressions, whilst if you talk to a negative listener you'll probably find yourself sheltering in the security of objective facts and concrete details.Beukeboom had 57 undergrad students watch an eight minute film about a kiosk owner, and then asked them to take their time and describe the film as fully as possible to two other participants. In actuality, these listeners were research assistants and for half the participants they assumed a positive listening style - smiling, nodding and maintaining an open bodily position - whilst for the the other participants they assumed a negative listening style - frowning and unsmiling.Participants describing the film to positive listeners used more abstractions, describing aspects of the film that can't be seen, such as a character's thoughts and emotions, and also included more of their own opinions. Beukeboom said this is because we interpret the smiles and nods of a positive listener as a sign of agreement and understanding, encouraging us to provide a more interpretative account. By contrast, negative listener's provoke in the speaker a more cautious and descriptive thinking style."Consider what this means," Beukeboom said. "By merely smiling or frowning a listener could influence how a speaker reports information and how it is subsequently remembered, and possibly passed on. In, for instance, witness interrogations, job interviews, politics, or psychotherapy, a simple smile or frown could potentially have a large impact."_________________________________Beukeboom, C.

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, July 7, 2009 5:15 PM, Edmonton International Airport (curiously located in Nisku)-After months of waiting, it's finally time for TAM. The Edmonton contingent consists of &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Skeptically Sp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;aking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; host Desiree Schell, Skeptically Speaking producer Sean Ouimette, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jill Powell, Marion Kilgour of the &lt;a href="http://skeptographers.com/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Skeptographers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, atheists-and-skeptics-about-town Rodrigo de la Jara and Nathan Hinman, and of course, myself. Jill has never flown before, so I chivalrously suggest she take the window seat, opting instead for the seat between her and Desiree. We taxi halfway to Calgary. Nathan, ever positive, makes a joke about people looking like ants-you may have had to be there. Hey, poker's on the little in-seat TV! We're headed to Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:15 PM, McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas-Three hours and one time zone later we touch down. Another joke by Nathan about people looking like ants-where does he get his material?-and we are suddenly surrounded by slot machines. I feel a great disturbance, as if millions of bank accounts cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. Nope, it's just Desiree, tugging at my arm. I'm dawdling, and the South Point bus is about to leave. That's why she's the host.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Brownian)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249882202734"><id gr:original-id="http://thequantumlobechronicles.blogspot.com/2009/08/chronic-stress-and-its-effects-on-brain.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a132fe20625dafca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Chronic stress and its effects on brain plasticity</title><published>2009-08-10T00:19:39Z</published><updated>2009-08-10T00:19:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/QRtfukqaJnk/chronic-stress-and-its-effects-on-brain.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://thequantumlobechronicles.blogspot.com/2009/08/chronic-stress-and-its-effects-on-brain.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Stress typically indicates a demand to adapt to challenges found in everyday life. However, when the stress is uncontrollable, unpredictable, and chronic it can increase the brain&amp;#39;s vulnerability to disease.Dagyte et al. over at the University of Groningen investigated the effects of acute and chronic foot-shock stress on neural plasticity by using hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis data collected from rats. They found that repeated, but not acute exposure to foot-shock stress caused a temporary suppression of Ki-67-positive cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus and a reduction in DCX expression. They suggest that a long-term accumulation of the stressors effects on hippocampal cell proliferation may ultimately compromise hippocampal circuitry.Dagyte G, Van der Zee EA, Postema F, Luiten PG, Den Boer JA, Trentani A, &amp;amp; Meerlo P (2009).

He left me the following comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Dr. I, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Just a few comments to perhaps lessen your ire, and clarify things.&lt;br&gt;Not sure if you read my whole post, but I also speculated that a decrease in waist circumference might be good independent of the narrow focus on absolute weight loss, since increased abdominal fat stores are associated with insulin resistance and even some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the American College of Sports Medicine (cool that you're a member... I can still dunk a tennis ball).... the ACSM recommending 60-90 minutes of exercise 5 days a week... that's pretty hard for most people to budget, and probably leads to a lot of people giving up before they've begun. Is that 60-90 minute recommendation evidence-based? Can you point me to the relevant Category A/B evidence the ACSM used? I'd really like to read it as a counterpoint to the PLos One study (which probably falls into Cateogry B evidence). Or was this just a "consensus statement" which as I'm sure you know carries less weight, and is very prone to dogmatic repetition of thought leaders' conjecture (see deteriorating evidence that very tight glycemic control in diabetics improves outcomes, very counterintuitive, but thoroughly disproven, and thought leaders and most physicians are still dogmatically chasing HBA1c levels below 6.5, to the possible detriment of their patients' health)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://firstwatch.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2009/421/2"&gt;http://firstwatch.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2009/421/2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that if you asked the authors of the Plos One study if they had required a cohort of the women in their study to cram in an additional 106-256 minutes of exercise per week, they might speculate that the "compensatory mechanisms" (that rendered all four cohorts' weight loss statistically insignificant when compared with one another) might also be expected to occur. Unfortunately, they might hypothesize that the extra exercise might not break the trend, and would certainly be unsustainable as a lifestyle, and that a successful weight loss strategy includes many other factors including dietary education as you mentioned, but that was outside the scope of this article and my post on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a clinician, not a researcher, I can tell you that some people are very successful in losing weight, and most do it with diet and exercise. I also see a lot of people who are unhappy, because they are exercising like crazy, trying to eat right, and their weight is not budging. As I mentioned in the very first paragraph and in multiple other places in my post - exercise is wonderful for a lot of reasons. Exercise may not need to be terribly vigorous, but rather the accumulated exertions of an entire day. Did you check out the fidgeting stuff? Interesting. I recommend exercise to just about all my patients without contraindication... but perhaps telling single moms, middle aged professionals with arthritis, and grad students preparing for their oral defenses to find one and half hours, Monday through Friday, for the rest of their lives (?), to dedicate to running on a treadmill as a way to lose weight.... Please show me the concrete evidence, ala this PLos One study, that this is effective and sustainable. The real world lacks your consummate will power!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What and how much we eat seems a better prime determinant of whether we lose weight or not, with exercise being very important for many reasons and certainly not detrimental, unless people are given the wrong expectations. I guess that's the bigger question... do you think people will stop exercising if more studies like this fail to reinforce current dogma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could work out for 2 hours every day, and on some days I do. No one is telling people not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then out of nowhere he sees a cute little mouse emerge from an imaginary hole in the wall, and he thinks that’s really darling until a bat flies in and eats the mouse and he starts screaming? Well that’s what I thought Alex would become this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:130px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/dvds.jpg" alt="Image: Virtualtoydrive.org" width="120" height="74"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Virtualtoydrive.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill gave away the cabinet that housed our DVD player, VCR, and cable box, and the guy arrived half an hour early to take the cabinet. So I had to yank all the cables quickly out of the back of the units without, of course in my life, marking where the cables were to be plugged back in. So reconstructing our home entertainment complex — which hadn’t been disconnected months, if not years — took a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And right at the start of this episode Alex decided he had to watch Sesame Street’s &lt;em&gt;Dance Party &lt;/em&gt;DVD, which he hadn’t wanted to watch in months, if not years. It’s an old Sesame Street DVD, with Muppets that never age trading witticisms with celebrities who do age. Between the countless hot dogs and pretzels and chicken nugget grease on his fingers and Alex’s tossing this DVD aside once done with it countless time, the back of this DVD looked like our cat had used it as a scratching post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dance party!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex, you can’t watch it right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dance PARTY!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex, it’s BROKEN RIGHT NOW!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like he had some homing device, zeroing right in on the one weakness at the one moment in our household, which to be fair has it’s share of weakness moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dance party?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex not now! It’s all scratched up anyway. It doesn’t work anyway. Don’t you remember?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t seem to, and if he did, he didn’t care. The cords were dangling as if shot off our DVD player, and not another second could pass without Alex watching a suddenly young Paula Abdul strut her stuff with Zooey. I must’ve heard “Dance party” pronounced about 50 times. At least Alex never screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out for a while, and when we returned I guess some bubble had risen in my brain because I suddenly remembered what went where among the web of cables. I plugged in the DVD player and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alex! &lt;em&gt;Dance Party&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He ran over. After one burst of Paula, it wouldn’t play. Too scratched. So without a murmur he watched PBS Kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The best person to comment on this is &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Home2000/JWPhome.htm"&gt;Jamie Pennebaker&lt;/a&gt;. Pending his contribution, I'll quote relevant observations from a summary page on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Home2000/Words.html"&gt;his web site&lt;/a&gt; …&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Pennebaker has graciously contributed a guest post on the meaning of "I", which follows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;In the last few months, a number of pundits have been analyzing the language of Barack Obama in an attempt to uncover who he really is.  The words that are attracting the most attention is his use of first person singular pronouns, or I-words.  As Mark Liberman and many others have noted, surprisingly few people have actually counted Obama’s use of 1st person singular pronouns and even fewer have stopped to think what “I” means.
&lt;p&gt;Before reading any further, it might be best if you took a quick 10-item “&lt;a href="http://www.utpsyc.org/itest/"&gt;I-Exam&lt;/a&gt;.”  This is a very brief quiz about who uses 1st person singular pronouns more than others.  I’m serious, go to &lt;a href="http://www.utpsyc.org/itest/"&gt;www.utpsyc.org/itest&lt;/a&gt;, take the test, check out your feedback.  Then come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;************&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back.  You should now have a better sense of the social and psychological meaning of I-words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of background might be helpful.  Not surprisingly, first-person singular (FPS) pronouns are used at very high rates in everyday speech.  Across thousands of natural conversations that we have recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, the word “I” is consistently the most frequently used word (averaging 4.73% of all words, compared with 0.56% “me” and 0.69% “my”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data set that my students and I have been relying on in the study of Bush, Obama, and others comes from press conferences or press opportunies wherein the person responds to questions posed by the press or, in some occasions, legislators or interested citizens.  In preparing the press conference texts, we strip out prepared remarks that typically occur at the beginning as well as the actual questions.  As presidents, both Obama and Bush have answered questions from the press approximately once per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with Liberman’s analyses of Obama’s and Bush’s inaugural address and other important speeches, Obama uses FPS pronouns at much lower rates than Bush. During the first 6 months of their presidencies, FPS pronouns accounted for 4.35% of Bush’s words and 2.88% of Obama’s.  Bush was significantly higher for all FPS words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I-words mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a psychological perspective, the use of FPS can reflect a number of overlapping processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The attention rule.&lt;/em&gt; Pronouns can be thought of as markers of attentional focus.  If the speaker is thinking and talking about a friend, expect high rates of third person singular pronouns.  If worried about communists, right wing radio hosts, or university administrators, words such as “they” and “them” will be higher than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “I” is no different.  If people are self-conscious, their attention flips to themselves briefly but at higher rates than people who are not self-conscious.  For example, people use the word “I” more when completing a questionnaire in front of a mirror than if no mirror is present.  If their attention is drawn to themselves because they are sick, feeling pain, or deeply depressed, they use “I” more.  And, by the same token, if they are deeply immersed in a task, FPS can drop to almost zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misperception is that I-use is associated with arrogance and dominance.  Studies consistently find the opposite: people higher in the social hierarchy use “I” words less.  The secure boss is surveying her or his kingdom calculating how to get more goodies.  The insecure underlings are trying to control their behaviors so as not to offend the leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ownership rule. &lt;/em&gt; Use of FPS can also serve as a territorial marker.  If people want to emphasize their connection with their topic, they may increase their use of I-words.  The use of I-words, then, links their connection of self to their conversational target.  By the same token, people occasionally distance themselves from a target.  Across multiple studies on deceptive communication, the best predictor of lying is a drop in the use of I-words.  For example, if an administrator is asked why large sums of money were spent for office décor, an open speaker might say, “I felt that the funds were being used in the ways the donors had requested.”  The more deceptive might say, “It was felt that the funds…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The graceful-I versus the sledgehammer-I.&lt;/em&gt; Not all I-words are alike. The graceful-I, often associated with the use of hedges, is one where the person is subtly acknowledging multiple perspectives.  Phrases starting with “I think that..”, “I wonder if..”, or “It seems to me that..” are all examples where the person is implicitly or politely making a request or an observation.  “I think it’s cold outside” (as opposed to “It’s cold outside”) is actually saying “I know that there are many views on this matter and I may, in fact, be wrong.  Indeed, when you go outside you might find it a bit warm but I personally felt that it was a bit cold outside. But I don’t want to intrude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can imagine a continuum of I-phrases that range from the ultra-polite graceful-I’s to more reportorial phrases (e.g., “I saw”, “I heard”) to egotistical, controlling sledgehammer I’s.  Sledgehammer-I’s are typically associated with action verbs such as hit, won, stop, or push.  Intuitively, the person who uses graceful-I’s is a person who is trying to withdraw from the action, attempting to be smaller from the listener’s perspective.  The sledgehammer user, on the other hand, is attempting to expand in the psychological environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on informal counts within natural conversations, the rate of graceful-I’s is quite high whereas the sledgehammer-I’s are low.  Perhaps because of these base rates, we tend to hear and to remember sledgehammer statements more than graceful ones. Indeed, this is why most people’s stereotypes of I-usage are wrong:  they are based on the relatively infrequent sledgehammer-I users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of the different uses of I-words occurred in the 2004 presidential election. According to a New York Times article at the time, John Kerry’s advisors were working with him to change the way that he spoke.  They felt he used the word “I” too much and that he should use the more inclusive “we” at higher rates.  Without going into detail here, use of “we” in the political world is a reliable marker of being cold, distant, and arrogant.  Our analyses of the speeches, debates, and press conferences up to that time showed Kerry to use I-words at rates far below his opponents (especially Bush) and his We-words far above the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry’s handlers did not understand personal pronouns and, in particular, the important distinction between graceful and sledgehammer I-use.  To appreciate the difference in I-use, look at 10 randomly selected uses of I from the third Bush-Kerry presidential debate in 2004:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kerry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times.&lt;br&gt;
I broke with my party in order to balance the budget&lt;br&gt;
I voted for IRA tax cuts.&lt;br&gt;
When I'm president, I'm sending that back to Congress&lt;br&gt;
I'll make them secure.&lt;br&gt;
I believe it was a failure of presidential leadership&lt;br&gt;
I am a hunter, I'm a gun owner.&lt;br&gt;
I ran one of the largest district attorney's offices in America&lt;br&gt;
I put people behind bars for the rest of their life.&lt;br&gt;
I've broken up organized crime; I know something about prosecuting.&lt;br&gt;
I was hunting in Iowa last year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bush:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actually, I made my intentions — made my views clear.&lt;br&gt;
I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban&lt;br&gt;
I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.&lt;br&gt;
I called the attorney general and the U.S. attorneys and said…&lt;br&gt;
And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent — I believe — is the number.&lt;br&gt;
To me, that's the best way to secure America.&lt;br&gt;
Mitch McConnell had a minimum-wage plan that I supported&lt;br&gt;
But let me talk about what's really important for the worker&lt;br&gt;
I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me&lt;br&gt;
I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Bush used the word “I” at much higher rates in the debates and other interactions, virtually everyone assumed that Kerry was the big FPS user.  The misperception is attributable to how the two men used their pronouns.  Bush was the graceful user and Kerry the sledgehammer.  Whereas Bush thought, believed, remembered, intended, talked, and called, Kerry was busy voting, breaking, sending, running, hunting, and making people secure. Oh, and he was a gun owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we don’t yet have a trustworthy psychological profile of the sledgehammer-I user.  An educated guess, however, would be that people adopt sledgehammer pronoun use in settings where they are insecure but want to come across as active, powerful, and confident.  The element of insecurity is central to this framework in that the sledgehammer user simultaneously is emphasizing that an important action was taken but, at the same time, I ME MYSELF caused that action.  It is important that you the listeners know how important I ME MYSELF am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Obama and what can his I’s tell us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview on NPR’s Weekend Edition on August 8, 2009, Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson were asked about their recent book, &lt;em&gt;The Battle for America 2008: The Story of an Extraordinary Election&lt;/em&gt;.  Johnson, looking back over his distinguished political reporting career studying presidents since Eisenhower, noted that Obama is “the single most self-confident of all the presidents” he has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama’s use of pronouns supports Johnson’s view.  Since his election, Obama has remained consistent in using relatively few I-words compared to other modern U.S. presidents.  His usage is overwhelmingly gentle-I as opposed to sledgehammer-I.  Contrary to pronouncements by various media experts, Obama is neither “inordinately fond” of FPS (George Will, Washington Post, 6/7/2009) nor exhibiting “the full emergence of a note of … imperial possession” (Stanley Fish, NYT, 6/7/2009).  Instead, Obama’s language suggests self-assurance and, at the same time, an emotional distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of my story was to give a funny story involving an awkward date.  It wasn’t awkward because she was a little person (the preferred nomenclature, I’m told).  It was awkward because she was a little person who didn’t tell me that about herself.  I think that was kind of shady and dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it would’ve been just as awkward if the picture she sent me showed her in a certain light to make her appear very tan or dark, but in person, it turned out she was very pale-white.  Not because I’m anti-pale-white people.  But because she’s not telling the whole truth about herself, about something I would’ve surely noticed when we met in person.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important to be upfront and honest about those things.  I don’t hide my body-type or skin color if I send someone a picture, because they’ll find out the truth immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why my date with the little person was awkward.  The Springer revelation didn’t help much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could I have made that point more explicitly?  Yes.  Should I have used that story at all?  Probably not.  It’s my fault that I didn’t make my point clear.  I would have also used a better choice of words.  But what’s done is done.  It’s the first time I’ve given that talk and it’ll change if/when I give it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who understood what I meant with that story for saying as much in the comments.  To the rest, I hope this explanation suffices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope regular readers know I would never try to pick on people for things that are obviously beyond their control.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary that you &lt;a href="http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/photos/view/3339/sort:Photo.created"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt; and vote for Ana by giving her &lt;strong&gt;Five&lt;/strong&gt; Stars (below the photo).  Please do this right now, and again tomorrow.  Don't vote for any of the other contestants.

&lt;p&gt;I've known Ana for nearly as long as I've lived in Minnesota, and I can vouch for her many talents. She is an accomplished stage and movie actress and model.  She is also an excellent photographer, quite a good singer, and a diligent political activist, fine artist, and dog lover.  

&lt;p&gt;Ana took a large role in documenting the police actions at the Democratic National Convention one year ago, and more recently, donated hundreds of hours of her time working with a non-profit overseeing the Franken Senate Race recount.  She is one of the Quiche Moraine team as well.  I count Ana as one of my best friends evah.  Tomorrow, I'll be driving around town from coffee shop to coffee shop ... well, checking my email and stuff. If you catch my drift.  

&lt;p&gt;Ana is currently in the top ten females in the contest, and if she remains there she'll have a chance. &lt;a href="http://madmencastingcall.amctv.com/photos/view/3339/sort:Photo.created"&gt;Please vote now, every vote counts&lt;/a&gt;.

I’ve &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/07/15/whats-the-best-way-to-repel-mosquitoes/"&gt;covered it fairly extensively&lt;/a&gt; at the Bug Blog–it’s the best thing we have to prevent a wide spectrum of insects from biting and transmitting an even wider spectrum of &lt;a title="CDC list" href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/list_mosquitoborne.htm"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So…Sigh.&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/menza/234932172/"&gt;&lt;img title="OMG" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/98/234932172_af89d57945_m.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="233"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some new DEET research was published this month, and the media…well, has done a crappy job of covering it.  Here’s the latest headline:  &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090804193230.htm"&gt;Insect Repellent DEET is Neurotoxic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing all the news stories have in common is a &lt;a title="Shame, BoingBoing!" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/08/07/report-deet-popular.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; alarmist tone&lt;/a&gt;, and reprinting freely from a press release that has very little connection to the reality of the paper.  When you look at the research, they did NOT find that DEET is neurotoxic, and it does NOT cause nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the take home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you decide not to use DEET insect repellent on the basis of this bad journalism, you are probably putting yourself in danger. &lt;/strong&gt;DEET is really the only repellent we have that can deal with ticks, and also protects against a wide range of biting flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results in this paper are preliminary, need to be confirmed, and even IF confirmed, remain irrelevant to the average person who might want to use DEET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, that’s the message.&lt;br&gt;
Now to the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the researchers ACTUALLY found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=BMC+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1186%2F1741-7007-7-47&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Evidence+for+inhibition+of+cholinesterases+in+insect+and+mammalian+nervous+systems+by+the+insect+repellent+deet&amp;amp;rft.issn=1741-7007&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=7&amp;amp;rft.issue=1&amp;amp;rft.spage=47&amp;amp;rft.epage=&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biomedcentral.com%2F1741-7007%2F7%2F47&amp;amp;rft.au=Corbel%2C+V.&amp;amp;rft.au=Stankiewicz%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Pennetier%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Fournier%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Stojan%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Girard%2C+E.&amp;amp;rft.au=Dimitrov%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Molgo%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hougard%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Lapied%2C+B.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CHealth%2CPublic+Health%2C+Entomology%2C+%2C+Cell+Biology"&gt;Corbel, V., Stankiewicz, M., Pennetier, C., Fournier, D., Stojan, J., Girard, E., Dimitrov, M., Molgo, J., Hougard, J., &amp;amp; Lapied, B. (2009). Evidence for inhibition of cholinesterases in insect and mammalian nervous systems by the insect repellent deet &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;BMC Biology, 7&lt;/span&gt; (1) DOI: &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-7-47"&gt;10.1186/1741-7007-7-47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“electrophysiological studies were performed on isolated mouse phrenic hemidiaphragm muscles. We showed that 500 µM deet prolonged by about threefold the decay time constant of synaptic potentials on endplate regions of the muscle fibre…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wha? Ah.&lt;br&gt;
Here’s a translation into English (by me):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We put DEET directly onto mouse cells and insect neurons &lt;strong&gt;in test tubes&lt;/strong&gt;. It had a mild inhibitory effect on an important enzyme. The amount of DEET we used on mouse cells was &lt;strong&gt;500 times&lt;/strong&gt; the level that was active for insect cells. The amounts we used were several orders of magnitude larger than you would ever encounter in life as a human user of DEET repellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best breakdown of this story I’ve seen yet was at &lt;a href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/08/science-journalism-and-bug-spray.html"&gt;Neuroskeptic&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Neuroskeptic saved me a whole lot of time and work by writing an excellent article that I will now swipe here and quote freely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the fact that DEET can act as a cholinesterase inhibitor in the lab changes nothing. It’s still safe, at least until evidence comes along that it actually causes harm in people who use it. You can’t show that something is harmful by doing an experiment showing how it &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;could&lt;/span&gt; be harmful in theory.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper, when combined with &lt;strong&gt;decades&lt;/strong&gt; of DEET usage data with very, very few adverse affects reported, is really not news at all.  It’s interesting, sure. But it’s not at all relevant to the average American trying not to be bitten while BBQing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also agree with this statement from Neuroskeptic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To be fair, there is one cause for concern in the paper – in the experiments, DEET interacted with other cholinesterase inhibitors, leading to an amplified effect. That suggests that DEET could become toxic in combination with cholinesterase inhibitor insecticides, but again, the risk is theoretical.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some situations, DEET is combined with other compounds that it could, potentially, interact with–but that almost never happens in the US. Those situations are more common in military and tropical uses.  This is a good note to be careful, and to monitor that in the future.  There is also some (laboratory) evidence that &lt;a title="when used on hairless mice..." href="http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/news/20040916/bug-spray-sunscreen-may-not-be-good-mix"&gt;sunscreen can increase absorption of DEET&lt;/a&gt;, and the two should be combined with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using DEET sensibly, you have nothing to worry about.&lt;br&gt;
What is sensible DEET use? Borrowing from &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org/family/wnv-jun03.htm"&gt;The American Pediatric Society&lt;/a&gt;, as well as my own experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use DEET under clothing. Put it ON your clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use DEET on the hands of young children; avoid applying to areas            around the eyes and mouth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use DEET over cuts, wounds or irritated skin. Wash treated skin            with soap and water after returning indoors; wash treated clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid spraying in enclosed areas; do not use DEET near food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20% DEET is enough for nearly all US situations. You can buy higher concentrations, but don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t spray DEET on spandex (it’s a long story, but trust me. This won’t end well for you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t drink, smoke, or otherwise do butt-stupid things with DEET. It’s safe, but only if you play by the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How can that be? And, more importantly, are they right? Let me take you on a short journey into the dark side of statistics...&amp;#39;Cross-sectional&amp;#39; studies are ones that measure a whole bunch of stats about a group of people, and then see which ones correlate. And almost everyone knows the basic trap here - that correlation does not mean causation.Just because A correlates with B, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that A causes B. It could be that B causes A, or that C causes both A and B, or any one of a myriad other arrangements!A basic, and very common, tool used to try to strip away some of these complicating factors is multivariate analysis. The idea behind it is very straightforward.Imagine you have a situation where you&amp;#39;re looking at the relationship between religion (or the lack of it) and intimate partner violence (IPV). In this case, what the researchers did was take a sample of female students at university in Chile, and ask them if they had ever been a victim of violence from a spouse or boyfriend.They also asked them how often they went to Church when they were 14, and split them into 3 groups - never attended, low/moderate attendance, and high attendance. Now, as you might expect there are some important differences between these groups.They were concerned with a few factors, in particular, that they knew from previous research reduced the likelihood that a woman is subjected to IPV. Women who come from a big city, were better educated, or who had mothers who had jobs and earned their own money - all these factors reduce the risk.So they used multivariate analysis to correct for any differences between the groups on these measures. What this analysis does is to tweak the data so that it is as if the three groups are the same. In other words, what come out of their model was the risk for IPV for women of different levels of family religion if all other factors are held constant.What they found was that, working with these assumptions, moderate/low attendance significantly reduced the risk of IPV compared with the &amp;#39;no religion&amp;#39; group. High levels of religion did not (although there was a slight trend in that direction).So, they conclude, a little bit of religion is a good thing - but too much and you cross a boundary, where women&amp;#39;s risk starts to increase (probably because of their diminished social status). All this is good, standard analysis, and perfectly valid.But, and it&amp;#39;s a big &amp;#39;but&amp;#39; that applies to an awful lot of similar research, it does not mean that encouraging religion is the way to reduce IPV. The bugbear in the analysis has a great name: joint endogeneity.Here&amp;#39;s the problem: the three big factors they corrected for - urban life, education, and mother&amp;#39;s employment - are actually all directly related to &amp;#39;no religion&amp;#39;. They all contribute to (or result from) diverse, multicultural, emancipated worldview, and this actually undercuts religion. What&amp;#39;s more, undercutting religion opens the flood gates to just such a world view.Is it possible to separate them? I don&amp;#39;t think that it is, in practice. It isn&amp;#39;t a coincidence that these factors are better in the non-religious. It&amp;#39;s a direct, causal effect - they have joint endogeneity. And this has important ramifications for the best way to tackle IPV in places like Chile.To show you what I mean, you need to know that when they ran their model, using all the different factors that characterise the three difference groups (not just religion), they found that the group with the lowest predicted risk was the no religion group. And the difference was big - the risk for this group was 7 percentage points lower than for the low moderate group. They comment:The size of this protective effect - 7 percentage points - is the same as that of never having witnessed domestic violence as a child, one of the major predictors of vulnerability to dating violenceIf all three groups were the same in every way except religion, this analysis shows that a modest dose of religion is linked to less IPV risk. But in the real world, there is no way these groups are going to be the same.You cannot, in practice, encourage religion without challenging the broad, open outlook the world that permits female enfranchisement. And this open outlook is the best and most important way to empower women and reduce their risks of being subjected to violence from their intimate partners.And it just so happens that it also leads to atheism._______________________________________________________________________________________Lehrer, E., Lehrer, V., &amp;amp; Krauss, R.

A well-groomed rail trail.  Two intrepid riders.  That's how it started out.  My daughter has  been going on longer and longer rides with me on the Trail-a-bike, so today I figured we'd try a great rail trail that goes past a heron rookery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it about a mile in before she freaked the fuck out.  She was screaming at the top of her lungs behind me, so I stopped.  Any time a bug or a fleck of mud landed on her, she couldn't handle it.  She felt like she was being attacked by bugs, and nothing was going to get her  back on the damned bike.  In fact, she was done walking, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I put her up on my shoulders, grabbed the bike, and hiked the mile or so back to the parking lot, sweat pouring down.&lt;/p&gt;

I will freely admit that it is my fault and I have been working to remedy my poor behavior.  My weight gain is the result of severely cutting back on the amount of exercise I was doing (from running 35 miles/week to running 5ish miles per week), eating far too many of the lab snacks I had been bringing in for students, going out for too many meals with new recruits/students/visiting scholars, eating out while traveling to conferences, and an increase in the amount of alcohol I've been consuming with colleagues.  I deserve every pound the fat fairy has placed on my more ample posterior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/08/realistic_expectations_and_why/fairy5np4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/08/realistic_expectations_and_why/fairy5np4-thumb-300x396-17185.jpg" alt="fairy5np4.jpg" height="396" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://img368.imageshack.us/img368/3183/fairy5np4.jpg"&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/a&gt; The evil fairy Dr. Isis imagines comes in the night to leave ten extra pounds on her ass while she sleeps.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, the issue goes beyond vanity over ten pounds or the way the afore mentioned slightly more ample posterior looks in a pair of jeans.  The issue is a particular lifestyle that could make me more prone to cardiovascular disease and diabetes and whose warning usually comes in the form of ten extra pounds.  That&amp;#39;s what Dr. Isis has had to put the kabosh on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pal has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_tmi_update_3.php"&gt;an interesting post&lt;/a&gt; up right now updating us on the status of his own reformation.  In it, he says this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The biggest problem is time management. I'm a great cook, and I could whip up a 
delicious half a chicken breast and brussels sprouts in no time at all---if I

In other disciplines — sociology, social psychology, economics, history — you&amp;#39;ll find even less of it. (The main systematic exception, Linguistic Anthropology, deserves a separate discussion — but the conclusion of such a discussion, I believe, would note a steep decline in empirical linguistic analysis. And of course I&amp;#39;m leaving out sociolinguistics, which is healthy enough but largely alienated from the rest of the social sciences.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are notable exceptions of several kinds, such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman"&gt;Erving Goffman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/schegloff/"&gt;Manny Schegloff&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Home2000/JWPhome.htm"&gt;Jamie Pennebaker&lt;/a&gt;. But such work emphasizes the paradox, since it shows that we can't blame the effect on a lack of intellectual opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It's not only in the social sciences where linguistic anemia is evident, of course. Over the past generation, the amount of language-related teaching and research in "language departments" (including departments of English) has declined to an unprecedented level. It's common to find highly-ranked English departments where neither undergraduates nor graduate students are trained in any sort of linguistic analysis at all, except perhaps by accident (see &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001839.html"&gt;this earlier post&lt;/a&gt; for a more specific discussion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But climate change is coming, in my opinion. And in this case, the driving force is not carbon emissions, but digital technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To state the obvious: Traditional mass media are now nearly all digital; new media are documenting (and creating) social interactions at extraordinary scale and depth; more and more historical records are available in digital form.  The digital shadow-universe is a more and more complete proxy for the real one. And in the areas that matter to the social sciences, much of the content of this digital universe exists in the form of digital text and speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future social scientist who wants to use this proxy universe to learn about the real one had therefore better know how to analyze the form and meaning of large digital archives of text and speech. And future social scientists who choose not to do this will work under a significant competitive disadvantage. (Numerical data, video recordings, and various kinds of relationship graphs are of course important too, but without analysis of speech and text, their value is lower.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The required tools include a good deal of computer science and statistics, but you also need to know what to program and what to model.  As a result, the basic concepts and skills of speech and text analysis are an important part of the future social science tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an increasing amount of research along these lines, mostly by computer scientists and computational linguists, along with a few rogue social scientists like Jamie Pennebaker. We've blogged about quite a few examples over the years. But I suspect that most social scientists don't see most of this stuff, because it appears in conference proceedings and journals that they don't read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, change is sure to come. I predict that over the next 20 years or so, this work will go mainstream. (I know that 20 years in internet time is a millennium or two, but Academia is culturally conservative to a degree that would turn Pashtun village elders green with envy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One symptom (and cause) of corpus-based social science going mainstream is that individual pieces of research will increasingly break out into the old media (or &lt;a href="http://www.wordle.net/"&gt;go viral&lt;/a&gt; in new media). This happened a few days ago to Peter Sheridan Dodds and Christopher M. Danforth, whose paper "&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/757723154j4w726k/"&gt;Measuring the Happiness of Large-Scale Written Expression: Songs, Blogs, and Presidents&lt;/a&gt;" (&lt;em&gt;Journal of Happiness Studies&lt;/em&gt;, published online 7/17/2009) was covered in the New York Times (Benedict Carey, "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/health/04mind.html"&gt;Does a Nation's Mood Lurk in Its Songs and Blogs?&lt;/a&gt;", 8/3/2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the paper's abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The importance of quantifying the nature and intensity of emotional states at the level of populations is evident: we would like to know how, when, and why individuals feel as they do if we wish, for example, to better construct public policy, build more successful organizations, and, from a scientific perspective, more fully understand economic and social phenomena. Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960s to the mid 1990s while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the Earth’s equator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the figure showing the secular trend in song-lyric happiness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the figure showing the recent trend in emotional valence estimated from aspects of blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the effects of age, latitude, and day of the week (phase of the moon is not pictured):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DoddsDanforthFig9.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DoddsDanforthFig9.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most work of this type, the linguistic analysis involved is pretty simple — but it&amp;#39;s still more than you&amp;#39;ll now find in the collected works of the faculty of the communications schools that I&amp;#39;ve looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you could raise various questions about their methods and their conclusions, as always in science (though the work seems basically sound to me). But the nice thing about this kind of research is that all of their data is published — their paper gives the URLs that they got it from. (In fact, they doubtless undertook this study in large part because the basic data is easily available.) And they could easily publish their code as well (though the algorithms seem simple and easy to replicate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[I'll note in passing that linguistics was left out of the publicity in this case: thus the NYT article quotes Prof. Pennebaker to the effect that &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;“The new approach that these researchers are taking is part of movement that is really exciting, a cross-pollination of computer science, engineering and psychology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/people/profile/index.asp?id=1675"&gt;Matthew Cobb&lt;/a&gt;, my fellow &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/04/05/introducing-the-vacation-blogger/"&gt;guest blogger&lt;/a&gt;, has called my attention to a recent paper in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6VRT-4WXYTR9-4&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_coverDate=08%2F06%2F2009&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=browse&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=3c0c504df67f80f755a91ec2114a532a"&gt;abstract only&lt;/a&gt;) by Christopher Bird (yes, that’s his name) and Nathan Emery on the behavior of rooks (&lt;em&gt;Corvus frugilegus&lt;/em&gt;) that was covered by &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8181233.stm"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article6753086.ece"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;on the&lt;em&gt; Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; website (both this and the BBC video are behaving badly, but the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;‘ is working for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Dartmoor rook Wikipedia" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/dartmoorrook-wikipedia.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=355" alt="A rook on Dartmoor, from Wikipedia" width="500" height="355"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rook on Dartmoor, from Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Bird and Emery have shown is that rooks will add stones to a tube of water, raising the water level, so they can reach the water to drink it. As many have noted, this corresponds quite closely to Aesop’s fable of &lt;a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_aesop_crow_pitcher.htm"&gt;the crow and the pitcher&lt;/a&gt;. This shows a remarkable cognitive ability, which seems actually insightful.  Crows and their relatives, especially ravens, have been the subject of much recent research showing that they have quite impressive intelligences.  The work of &lt;a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~biology/Faculty/Heinrich/Heinrich.html"&gt;Bernd Heinrich&lt;/a&gt; (see, for example, his &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Raven-Investigations-Adventures-Wolf-Birds/dp/0061136050/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1249838136&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mind of the Raven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is especially notable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note here that unlike America, which has one common species of crow (&lt;a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Crow/id"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corvus brachyrhynchos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; link is from a great site maintained by the &lt;a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/"&gt;Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology&lt;/a&gt;), Britain has &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/families/crows.asp"&gt;several species of crows&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/rook/index.asp"&gt;rook&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/j/jackdaw/index.asp"&gt;jackdaw&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/chough/index.asp"&gt;chough&lt;/a&gt; (the latter not actually very common, but I like the sound of its name; links from another great site from the &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds&lt;/a&gt;– h/t to Matthew). Several species also &lt;a href="http://rarities.ornithologiki.gr/en/eaop/bird_list.htm"&gt;occur in Greece&lt;/a&gt;, so Aesop’s fable may have applied to rooks. Ravens are basically large-bodied crows; the &lt;a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/id"&gt;common raven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/raven/index.asp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corvus corax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is found throughout much of the northern hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

(Woo!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprising (to me, anyway), the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers have a *lot* of people on their side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the emails they received after all the publicity — some &lt;a href="http://www.iowaatheists.org/drupal/node/155"&gt;against them&lt;/a&gt; and many more &lt;a href="http://www.iowaatheists.org/drupal/node/156"&gt;for them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better is this &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090808/OPINION03/908080306/1110"&gt;editorial in the Des Moines Register&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps a way out of this dilemma is to turn the advertising job over to an outside agency that would fill the ad spots on buses, but even that may not absolve DART of ultimate responsibility. Or, quit advertising, but that would cost the authority $200,000 in annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the authority should develop a thicker skin for criticism. The ad in question is hardly cause for outrage: It simply makes the statement of fact that you aren’t alone if you don’t believe in God.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest next time, we get a billboard that simply reads “ATHEIST.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That alone would generate tons of complaints from religious people and make our point just as well: We exist and we’re not afraid to say that.&lt;br&gt;

Its owner, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sdgeek"&gt;Mark Yturralde&lt;/a&gt;, sent me this description of its origin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the Columbia accident, I felt compelled to do something. Space has always meant so much to me, and I felt I wanted to memorialize them somehow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I donated to college funds and other charities in their name, but still felt like I needed to do more, and I found myself reliving and considering Challenger, and Apollo one too, Gus Grissom being a long time hero of mine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One morning, I made a list of all of them. It just struck me. I’ll put their names on my forearm. People will see them. They’ll ask who they are. I can then tell them about my tattoo, and what it means to me. Everytime someone asks, and I explain it, they take a second. They reflect. They remember.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;American forces have dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki - the second such attack on Japan in three days.

&lt;p&gt;The bomb was dropped by parachute from an American B29 Bomber at 1102 local time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It exploded about 1,625 ft (500m) above the ground and is believed to have completely destroyed the city, which is situated on the western side of the Japanese island of Kyushu.&lt;/p&gt;

I know from my reading, that certain foods are better at inducing a durable sense of satiety, and I've been trying to incorporate these foods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, my typical lunch of late has been a good salad with either a few ounces of grilled chicken breast or a hard boiled egg on it, and a nice portion of melon.  This gives me a meal with a high volume of fruits and veggies, but still some fats and proteins.  I think, and we'll see what the experts say, that it is a bit too carbohydrate-poor, leaving me craving sweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I've been kinda bad, but in general, I'm eating a lot more fruits and vegetables than I had been.  I have a bit of a problem.  I love veggies, but I don't love most fruits.   For instance, I made the kiddo waffles this morning, and she usually has berries with them (it's her weekend treat), but I wanted to avoid the simple carbs, so I'm making some real Irish oatmeal, a quarter-cup serving.  It's low volume, but I don't like berries, so I'll have to find something to bulk it out with. I wilted a handful of spinach, and scrambled one egg and one egg white, with a tsp of grated romano cheese.  If I'm still hungry, I'll get a slice of melon.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is time management.  I'm a great cook, and I could whip up a delicious half a chicken breast and brussels sprouts in no time at all---if I had time to stop at the market on the way home and whip it up at 10 at night.  I'm going to have to match this lifestyle change to the immaleable bits of my life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, Isis, I went shopping yesterday and left the granola bars behind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh, and I did pick up some spinach and chick peas at the market which which to make a nice little "curry" which I hope to take for lunch and/or dinner tomorrow. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_tmi_update_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/VFAQ21gnd_Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249828646052"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_very_friendly_atheist.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd32b6ba5ac6077e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">The very friendly atheist</title><published>2009-08-09T15:09:49Z</published><updated>2009-08-09T15:09:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/4Uvhbn9oEBk/the_very_friendly_atheist.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_very_friendly_atheist.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'll be departing the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt; conference shortly, to spend most of my day traveling back home. I have to say a few things about it, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a good meeting! What the student attendees get is some excellent training in how to organize and maintain an active student group, and it's worth it to go. If you want to fire up a gang of campus freethinkers, you should think about coming next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was exceptionally well-organized: talks were paced well, everything was kept moving at a good clip, and plenty of time was left between talks for schmoozing. And the talks all started on time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stayed in the dorms with the students, and it was an interesting experience. There was a time in my youth when I could stay up until 4am talking, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SSA is a great organization, but they&amp;#39;re hurting for money (like many non-profits right now). Maybe you aren&amp;#39;t a student, so you aren&amp;#39;t planning to go to their meetings—but that just means you can maybe afford to &lt;a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/join"&gt;donate a few bucks&lt;/a&gt; to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your entertainment, I'll leave you with an example of one talk, by &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/"&gt;Hemant Mehta&lt;/a&gt;, who discussed something of importance to godless college students: dating. He has some tips here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him he's doing it all wrong. The best way is to pick the prettiest girl in your neighborhood when you're in third grade, follow her around for 10 years or so, and then ask her to marry you after a few dates.

&lt;p&gt;Deep in the outer realms of our solar system, well over a billion kilometers away, something bizarre happened at Saturn’s F ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, seriously: what the &lt;em&gt;hell&lt;/em&gt; happened here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5683/Punching_through_the_F_Ring"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/cassini_fring_punch.jpg" alt="Cassini image of something punching through Saturn’s F ring"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5683/Punching_through_the_F_Ring"&gt;This is one of the latest pictures&lt;/a&gt; returned from the remarkable human achievement that is the Cassini spacecraft, a probe the size of a school bus that has been orbiting the ringed planet since 2004. It’s returned one incredible picture after another, and lately — as Saturn’s orbit has brought it to a point where the rings are nearly edge-on to the Sun — things have gotten not only spectacular but also really &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rings are incredibly thin, only a few meters in thickness despite being hundreds of thousands of kilometers across. Over the past few months, as the Sun shines almost straight into the rings (instead of down on them), every bump and irregularity sticks out like, well, like a tree in the desert. Weird gravitational effects from Saturn’s fleet of moons tune and resonate the countless particles making up the rings, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/11/saturns-rings-do-the-wave/"&gt;creating beautiful waves and ripples&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this, this is something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/08/cassini_fring_punch_zoom.jpg" alt="Zoom of Cassini image of something punching through Saturn’s F ring"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly clear what’s going on here, even in this slightly zoomed shot. But it looks for all the world - or worlds — like some small object on an inclined orbit has punched through Saturn’s narrow F ring, bursting out from underneath, and dragging behind it a wake of particles from the rings. The upward-angled structure is definitely real, as witnessed by the shadow it’s casting on the ring material to the lower left. And what’s with the bright patch right where this object seems to have slammed in the rings? Did it shatter millions of icy particles, revealing their shinier interior material, making them brighter? Clearly, &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; awesome and amazing happened here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first inclination (haha! &lt;em&gt;Inclination!&lt;/em&gt; As always, I slay me) is to say that there isn’t enough material in the rings to create what amounts to a hydrodynamic wake behind a moving object. When you move through air you leave a wake behind you, but there are gazillions of particles per cubic centimeter in the Earth’s air at sea level. I would think that even in Saturn’s ring, the density of particles wouldn’t be enough to support a phenomenon like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently, I’m wrong. Without doing a full-blown hydrodynamic calculation it’s hard to say what’s possible and what isn’t. Cassini scientists are currently doing just that, in order to better understand what this odd image is trying to tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have to wonder: is this a common occurrence? Is this object on an orbit that intersects the rings so that it plunges up through them and then again down into them every time it circles Saturn? If so, how does that affect the rings overall, especially over millions of years? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was this a singular event, some small object whose orbit was affected by a nearby massive moon, changing its path, putting it on a collision course with Saturn’s mighty and vast ring system? That seems awfully unlikely…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… but when it comes to this weird, weird place, I’ve learned my intuition is monumentally inadequate. Nature, it turns out, has a far greater imagination than any mere human. We are fated, I think, to watch Nature unfold before us and try to figure it out after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oh, isn’t that the joy of science?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249819600446"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-101852615642382097">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/861f4e50e95402ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Dr. Valerie Tarico&amp;#39;s Interview With the Internet Monk</title><published>2009-08-09T09:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-09T09:59:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/2YJajiOetYs/dr-valerie-taricos-interview-with.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/101852615642382097/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=101852615642382097" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/dr-valerie-taricos-interview-with.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">This is &lt;a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/dr-valerie-tarico-non-theists-and-evangelicals-the-im-interview"&gt;a great interview&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-101852615642382097?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, there was a nice little piece about atheists “&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=8280168"&gt;converging on the Creation Museum&lt;/a&gt;” at ABC News.  (There may be more big stories to come…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One mistake in the article that has not yet been fixed is in this excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the singular moment of noticeable conflict, Derek Rogers, a computer science major at Dalhouise University in Nova Scotia, Canada, was detained by guards for wearing a shirt with a slogan recently plastered on buses by activist groups that read “there’s probably no God, so get over it.” He was escorted to the bathroom and ordered to flip the shirt inside-out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shirt did not read that at all.  It said, “There’s probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a big difference, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see Derek’s version of the story here:&lt;/p&gt;

Another &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1647"&gt;Shoebox cartoon&lt;/a&gt;, this one by brian, gives the background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NatureVacuum.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some serious history behind this famous but widely misunderstood slogan, coined originally (I think) by Hero of Alexandria. Before Pascal and Descartes (and Boyle and Hobbes and a cast of thousands), there was Hero's footnote to Aristotle's "plenism".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the background, we turn to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article on &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/"&gt;Nothingness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Aristotle denied the void can explain why things move. Movement requires a mover that is pushing or pulling the object. An object in a vacuum is not in contact with anything else. If the object did move, there would be nothing to impede its motion. Therefore, any motion in a vacuum would be at an unlimited speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Aristotle's refutation of the void persuaded most commentators for the next 1500 years. There were two limited dissenters to his thesis that vacuums are impossible. The Stoics agreed that terrestrial vacuums are impossible but believed there must be a void surrounding the cosmos. Hero of Alexandria agreed that there are no naturally occurring vacuums but believed that they can be formed artificially. He cites pumps and siphons as evidence that voids can be created. Hero believed that bodies have a natural horror of vacuums and struggle to prevent their formation. You can feel the antipathy by trying to open a bellows that has had its air hole plugged. Try as you might, you cannot separate the sides. However, unlike Aristotle, Hero thought that if you and the bellows were tremendously strong, you could separate the sides and create a vacuum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Hero&amp;#39;s views became more discussed after the Church&amp;#39;s anti-Aristotelian condemnation of 1277 which required Christian scholars to allow for the possibility of a vacuum. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… scholars writing in the aftermath of the condemnation of 1277 proposed various recipes for creating vacuums. One scheme was to freeze a sphere filled with water. After the water contracted into ice, a vacuum would form at the top.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Aristotelians replied that the sphere would bend at its weakest point. When the vacuists stipulated that the sphere was perfect, the rejoinder was that this would simply prevent the water from turning into ice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Neither side appears to have tried out the recipe. If either had, then they would have discovered that freezing water expands rather than contracts. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Hero was eventually refuted by experiments with barometers conducted by Evangelista Torricelli and Blaise Pascal. Their barometer consisted of a tube partially submerged, upside down in a bowl of mercury. What keeps the mercury suspended in the tube? Is there an unnatural vacuum that causes the surrounding glass to pull the liquid up? Or is there no vacuum at all but rather some rarefied and invisible matter in the “empty space”? Pascal answered that there really was nothing holding up the mercury. The mercury rises and falls due to variations in the weight of the atmosphere. The mercury is being pushed up the tube, not pulled up by anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;When Pascal offered this explanation to the plenist Descartes, Descartes wrote Christian Huygens that Pascal had too much vacuum in his head. Descartes identified bodies with extension and so had no room for vacuums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descartes was not the only 17th-century wit to make this joke. Thus Thomas Pecke, "Upon Marcus", 1659:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Why durst you offer &lt;em&gt;Marcus&lt;/em&gt; to aver&lt;br&gt;
Nature abhorr'd a &lt;em&gt;vacuum&lt;/em&gt; ? confer&lt;br&gt;
But with your empty skull, then you'll agree&lt;br&gt;
Nature will suffer a vacuitie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a more extended and more effective version of the joke in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Boyle"&gt;Roger Boyle&lt;/a&gt;, Earl of Orrery, &lt;em&gt;Mr Anthony, A Comedy&lt;/em&gt; (which seems to have been a sort of 17th-century &lt;em&gt;Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt;), where Mr. Anthony and his friend Jack Plot gang up on Mr. Pedagog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Plot: How like you this, Mr. Pedagog , have I not taught your Pupil rarely this Morning?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Anthony:  Prethee let me have my full swinge at him (for he has had his many a dismal time at me:) I say, if thou dost not conform to all the Maxims of Jack Plot, Tom Art , and my own dear self, I will peach thee at such a rate to my Sire, as shall provoke him to uncase thee out of thy Pedagogical Cassock, Condemn to the Flame, Martyrlike all thy Ferula's, Grammars, Dictionaries, Classick Authors, and Common-Place Books; nay, take thy Green Glasses out of thy Spectacles, and leave thee only thy Horn-cases to look through; by which, thou wilt be as able to read Prayers with thy Nose as with thy Eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Plot: Nay, if thou dost not frisk as lustily to a single Kit, whenever thy late Pupil and my present Convert bids thee, as to 24 Violins, I will Convert thy Lictorian Bundles of Birch, which Consul-like thou hast carryed before thee, into Rods for thy own Posteriors, and have no more mercy on thy Hanches, than thou usest to have on my Friend Anthony 's, when he cannot say his Lesson, though he be the greatest Dunce of the two; only his Imbecillity, varnish'd over with a Pythagorean Gravity, passes for profound Knowledge in thy Fathers Shallow Pate; where, if there is a Vacuum in Nature, there it needs must be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Anthony: By this hand, I long to open it, to try the Experiment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear to me whether (or how) &lt;em&gt;Mr. Anthony&lt;/em&gt;'s author, Roger Boyle,  was related to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Boyle"&gt;Robert Boyle&lt;/a&gt;, the antagonist of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbes"&gt;Thomas Hobbes&lt;/a&gt; in an important controversy about the existence of vacuums and the proper conduct of scientific investigation. Anyhow, Hobbes hated Descartes, but agreed with him about vacuums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;By the time he published &lt;em&gt;De corpora&lt;/em&gt; in 1655, Hobbes had actually adopted … a plenist theory, denying the existence of any empty spaces — even at the atomic level — in the universe. Why did he make this change? According to Shapin and Schaffer, the fundamental reasons were political. Hobbes settled on a materialist plenism in order to exclude &amp;#39;incorporeal substances&amp;#39;, such as spirits and the human soul …, because these were the props and devices used by priestcraft to harness people&amp;#39;s fears and thereby gain power in the state, subverting lawful authority. The difficulty with this explanation is that his attack on &amp;#39;incorporeal substance&amp;#39; required only materialism; it did not require plenism too. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The real reasons for Hobbes&amp;#39; shift from vacuist to plenist are to be found in experimental physics […] &amp;#39;It is said that one can see through the empty space […] from which it follows that the action of a light-producing body is being propagated through a vacuum (which I think is impossible).&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though action at a distance remains unmediated by ethereal vortices, the story continues, and not just in the comics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Historians of science wonder whether the ether that was loudly pushed out the front door of physics is quietly returning through the back door under the guise of “space”. Quantum field theory provides especially fertile area for such speculation. Particles are created with the help of energy present in “vacuums”. To say that vacuums have energy and energy is convertible into mass, is to deny that vacuums are empty. Many physicists revel in the discovery that vacuums are far from empty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — I&amp;#39;m very sorry to say that the remark attributed to Descartes may be a myth, or perhaps an exaggeration (In the Stanford Encyclopedia, too, and &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=Descartes+Pascal+%22too+much+vacuum%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Books"&gt;many other apparently authoritative places&lt;/a&gt;!) At least, according to Daniel Garber, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BLUCPEFJ9TUC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=huygens&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Descartes' Metaphysical Physics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, p. 142:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;All Descartes ever got from Pascal was the promise of a refutation of his preferred explanation. At the end of the &lt;em&gt;Expériences nouvelles&lt;/em&gt;, a preliminary outline of a never completed treatise on the vacuum, Pascal promised to respond to the objection "that a matter imperceptible, extraordinary, and unknown to all of the senses fills the space [above the column]," a position formulated with Descartes in mind, no doubt. Descartes seems to have received the work in good humor. Writing to Huygens on 8 December [1647], shortly after having received the &lt;em&gt;Expériences nouvelles&lt;/em&gt;, he noted:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It appears to me that the young man who wrote this booklet has the vacuum a bit too much on his mind, and is somewhat hasty. I wish the volume he promises were already available, so that one could see his reasons, which are, if I am not mistaken, insufficiently solid for what he has undertaken to prove. (AT V 653)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not at all clear from this translation that D was really making a joke about P having &amp;quot;too much vacuum in his head&amp;quot; — it would be nice to see the original French (or Latin?).]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249817064490"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4356">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f2f9d3205181a377</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Slightly Off Topic" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Sticky" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 Words"/><category term="natureimages" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="nature images"/><title type="html">Photography Contest Continues ...</title><published>2009-08-09T11:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T22:26:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/photography-con-1.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;… but now the decision is up to you, our readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we did.&lt;/strong&gt; We received submissions from around 50 photographers (but who’s counting?). Many but not all submitted 3 photographs, so let us say perhaps 120 in all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We triaged the photographs, first by making a rough pass and rejecting those that were clearly not in contention. Then we looked over the others and thinned them down to one entry per person, in order to allow as many people as possible to participate in the final round. Many of the rejected photographs went into an “Honorable Mention” file, and we will display them on Mondays as part of our regular 1000 Words feature. We tried to retain mostly photographs that were not only inherently good pictures   but also had scientific interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We next defined 3 categories, which we called, somewhat loosely, animal, vegetable, and mineral. Mineral was intended to include geology, paleontology, cosmology, and anything that was not biology. Fossils are minerals, and so are stars. Bacteria (you should forgive us) are vegetables, partly because they are not animals and partly because they were vegetables when I was in high school. We then selected 5 to 6 photographs in each category; these are the finalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three categories, happily, means 3 prizes, so we added a book. The prizes are now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;        
&lt;a href="http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/Why_Evolution_Works.html" rel="external "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Matt Young and Paul K. Strode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do.&lt;/strong&gt; We will display one of the 6 finalists in the mineral category every day at 12:00 noon, Central Daylight Time, for 6 days, beginning Monday, August 10. We will display all 6 entries together and ask you to vote for your favorite picture beginning the following Saturday. The winner will be chosen in approximately one week. Then we will repeat the process with the vegetable category and then the animal category.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re Not Alone” too offensive to their delicate sensibilities. Well now, after the Iowa Atheists refused to change the slogan (because honestly, you really can’t get much tamer and less offensive than the one they had), the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority officials (DART) agreed to put the atheist&lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090807/NEWS/90807038/DART--Atheist-group-s-ads-will-go-back-on-buses"&gt; bus ads back up in Iowa&lt;/a&gt; unchanged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By honoring the freedoms protected through our shared civil liberties, DART, like other businesses that accept advertising, will be in the position of displaying messages and images that may be controversial or uncomfortable to some, but legal and protected by civil rights,” DART General Manager Brad Miller stated in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also probably didn’t hurt that the Iowa ACLU stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Iowa Atheist and Freethinkers group also sent an e-mail Friday to Gov. Chet Culver, who said Thursday that he was offended by the advertisement and the message it sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are disappointed he decided to take sides on what we see as a free-speech issue,” Kryuchkov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suck it, Chet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/expelled_from_the_creation_mus.php"&gt;Now he can add being expelled from the Creation “Museum” to his resume.&lt;/a&gt; Well, actually he wasn’t expelled; it was an atheist he was with that was expelled from the “museum” and another atheist he was with that was harrassed by the “museum’s” security staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all began several weeks ago with PZ Myers along with the Secular Student Alliance (SSA) decided to organize a mass group of atheists, scientists, and other secular thinkers to all visit the Creation “Museum” together to see for themselves what they’ve been criticizing and, I imagine, to draw media attention to the affair. &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=8280168&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;And they certainly got the attention of ABC&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_creation_museum_has_given.php"&gt;At last count, I know there were 240 people planning on joining them&lt;/a&gt;. And the number had probably grown since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the Creation “Museum” officials were getting worried and wrote to Myers and the SSA warning them against misbehaving. . .as if they had any reason to think those attending this event would misbehave. That letter can be read on the link just above. And according to Myers and at least one of my other sources that attended, aside from joking to each other about the ridiculous nonsense in the “museum”, no one misbehaved.But that didn’t seem to stop “museum” officials from harassing individuals and eventually kicking a few people out of the “museum” for non-existent infractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/atheists-expelled-from-creation-museum/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/A4ThvM9BKZU/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it seems the “museum” feels that merely disagreeing with its “science” and mocking it to one’s friends is grounds for having visitors removed from the property. This is of course absurd. Could you imagine if the American Museum of Natural History ejected visitors for being creationists? Or if the Museum of Modern Art ejected visitors for critiquing the art or mocking Jackson Pollack’s work quietly with their friends? It would never happen. That’s because REAL museums are tools for education and don’t try to control how its visitors think.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I fling immature epithets at the world of alternative medicine, I need to give a brief overview of the regulations imposed on those who make &lt;em&gt;real &lt;/em&gt;medicine. The medicines that do everything from saving lives to preventing gas. In America, these regulations are known as "Current Good Manufacturing Practices", or cGMPs for short.  The best way to illustrate the thoroughness and complexity of these regulations is to use a narrative. The narrative won‘t even scratch the surface, but it will give you a general idea:&lt;/p&gt;

I was even more honored to be on the same panel as Dr. Joe Albietz, a pediatric intensivist from the University of Colorado who organized a fund-raising drive to benefit the Southern Nevada Health District and contribute to the vaccination of children in a region where the vaccination rate is, unfortunately, low. I’m even more pleased that Dr. Albietz has agreed to join SBM as a regular blogger. Here’s a little bit about Joe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joseph Albietz, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;a href="http://www.thechildrenshospital.org/about/doctor/detail.aspx?doctorID=19027"&gt;Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, Denver, and The Children’s Hospital.  In addition to his service in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, his time is divided between translational research in the field of pediatric pulmonary hypertension and medical education where he acts as the pediatric intensive care associate fellowship director. Dr. Albietz graduated from the University of Missouri at Kansas City and completed his residency training in pediatrics and a fellowship in pediatric critical care at the University of Colorado, Denver.  He is board certified in Pediatrics and Pediatric Critical Care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to writing for Science Based Medicine Dr. Albietz also periodically contributes to the James Randi Educational Foundation’s (JREF) &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/swift-blog-biographies.html"&gt;Swift Blog&lt;/a&gt; and coordinated JREF’s &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/609-help-re-establish-the-herd-immunity-of-nevada.html"&gt;vaccine drive&lt;/a&gt; to benefit the Southern Nevada Health District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Albietz’s first blog post is scheduled for Friday, August 21. In the meantime, please welcome him to the fold. He’s a great addition to our crew of bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are some of Alex’s big letters — a summer purchase that’s become a part of his daily toy-strewing routine — on the wall on nails. Tonight Jeff rearranged a few to spell N-O-S-E. Then he touched his own nose, said, “Look, Alex: nose.” Alex stared intently at the letters. Then he got up, walked over and put them back in the order they’d been in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:260px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/lettere.jpg" alt="Image: cdn.overstock.com" width="250" height="250"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: cdn.overstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about 15 minutes before that, Alex had been sitting on the couch reading a book. I say “reading” but we’re really not sure how much he can read. We know he can read some words: chicken, cookie, chocolate, pizza, shoes. He’s picked up a lot from street signs. But sustained reading? Just no way to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book he picked up was a toddler board book with one picture and just a couple of words on each page. Fine with me if that’s where he wants to start. We hope the new school year — and the new school — sets the bar higher for Alex’s reading. For those 15 minutes, while Alex was reading his book quietly, I thought how wonderful it was for him to enjoy what we all enjoy every day: the simple act of decoding words on a page, bringing us new images and thoughts. Otherwise, it’s as if he’s just left with toy animals and has to supply all the words and action himself.&lt;/p&gt;

A year ago, Randi stepped down as president of the James Randi Educational Foundation and named Phil Plait of the Bad Astronomy blog as his successor. Though Randi is still heavily involved with the organizatio, he felt it was getting harder for him to remain active in the day to day operations. He also wanted to focus more energy on two more books that he’s writting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one piece of sad news is that at the recent TAM conference (The Amazing Meeting), Randi informed people that he has cancer. He is fighting it with the best medical treatment available but unfortunately that means he will not be attending some of the upcoming skeptical gatherings such as at Dragon Con in Georgia, the NECSS in NYC, and TAM London. But one thing that isn’t wrong with Randi is his heart, which is what “psychic” Sylvia Browne predicted several years ago is or would eventually have problems. Sorry Sylvia, his heart’s still as fine as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

For breakfast Pal ate a bowl of shredded wheat with sugar and skim milk.  While I agree with Pal that a calorie is a calorie, and the only way to effectively lose weight is to reduce the intake of calories regardless of the composition of those calories, different foods have different abilities to cause lasting &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/satiety"&gt;satiety&lt;/a&gt;.  Pal&amp;#39;s shredded wheat breakfast followed by a granola bar snack, composed entirely of carbohydrates, is a poor choice for inducing satiety.  With not a fruit or vegetable in sight, it is nutritionally poor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interesting study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, Vander and colleagues fed a group of overweight women either eggs or a bagel (something you&amp;#39;ll notice Pal has been eating a lot of) for breakfast, matched so that each meal had the same number of calories.  Two weeks later the women came back and were fed the opposite breakfast.  The women reported feeling more sated after eating the egg breakfast compared to the bagel breakfast, felt more content throughout the day, and consumed few calories over the next 36 hours.  But, this study is not unique.  Leidy and Campbell demonstrated in a group of 38 women that a diet high in protein led to reduced reported post-meal hunger.  These effects aren&amp;#39;t relegated to women.  Johnstone and Lobley studied 17 obese men and found that a low carbohydrate diet resulted in decreased feelings of hunger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These studies are not easy to conduct, human research participants are difficult to control, and there are certainly studies that demonstrate no effect of increasing protein on feelings of hunger.  I think as one evaluates these studies, they have to keep the following questions in mind:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did the investigators feed the participants every meal, or did they prescribe a diet and trust the participants to follow it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Were the participants exercising and, if so, what was their caloric deficit?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long were the participants eating a particular diet before their satisfaction was assessed?  Behavior and psychology in long-term diet studies can be quite the confounders and limit the ability to compare long-term and short-term studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Still, I think there is sufficient evidence to suggest that, at least in the short-term, adding protein can increase satisfaction with a meal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I was pondering this, I received an email from one of my favorite SciBlings, &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/neurotopia"&gt;Scicurious of the Neurotopia blog&lt;/a&gt;.  She heard of my displeasure with Pal&amp;#39;s diet and writes that she is having dietary issues of her own.  She&amp;#39;s concerned about her own lean to fat mass ratio and spends her day feeling hungry.  I asked her to log what she ate for a day (she has since done three...overachiever) and I told her I would do the same.   The comparison is below the cut.  Also below the cut are citations for the articles I mentioned above.&lt;br&gt;

The impetus for this study came from an interest in studies implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) activity in the facilitation of striatal-dependent memories in by emotional arousal. They measured unit and local field potential recordings from the BLA, striatum, auditory cortex, and intralaminar  thalamus of cats trained on a stimulus-response task where the presentation of one or two tones predicted reward delivery.They discovered that gamma oscillations originating from the BLA coordinated amygdalostriatal interactions more so than oscillations in other frequency bands. They also found that the coherence of CS-evoked BLA striatial gamma increased along with improvements in behavioral performance during a striatal-dependent stimulus-response task. They suggest that this may facilitate synaptic plasticity along with other underlying mechanisms.Popescu AT, Popa D, &amp;amp; Paré D (2009).

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img title="postcard eyes" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/postcard-eyes2-150x96.jpg" alt="postcard eyes" width="150" height="96"&gt;Allowing for any obvious religious connotations that might arrise by using such an ostentatious title as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Truth!,”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to officially announce my new promo video. The title was chosen to both entice and inveigle. I need to lure the attention of as many people as I possibly can! With a title like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Truth!,”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;how can I go wrong? I finally sat down and managed to cull together a cogent collection of video clips with the avowed intention to once and for all dispell which side of the psychic/skeptic fence I’m speaking from. I’m happy to report this eight minute – fifty five second piece says it all…&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="everything-thumb" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/everything-thumb-225x141.jpg" alt="everything-thumb" width="225" height="141"&gt;I’m posting my announcement here because, 1) Hey, if I can’t self publicize myself here at Skepticblog, where can I do it?  2) I know there has been a lot of criticism here and elsewhere of my checkered past. It’s time to clear the air. It took  months to collect the best television bits, news clips and guest spots I had amassed over the past fifteen or so years. Not that I’m some kind of psychic super-star of any stripe mind you. Far from it. I’m not.  Believe me when I say I had to fight hard to get &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;of that work.  Try working as a “professional psychic medium” in Hollywood for a few years and you’ll see what I mean. On second thought, don’t bother. It’s not terribly rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was revealing when I actually took the time to review and mentally edit the programs I had appeared on with a now much more more critical eye. I definitely “pitched some woo” back in my early magician/mentalist days. That was what was expected of me. There were shows like the Sci-Fi Channel’s &lt;em&gt;“Mysteries, Magic and Miracles,” &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;“Mysterious Forces Beyond ” &lt;/em&gt;where I really pushed the believer envelope by performing “miracles,” ballyhooing seances and selling that image. No excuses. I played that role and was paid for it. I can understand how if any skpetical folks saw the &lt;em&gt;“Mysteries”&lt;/em&gt; episode, (hosted by Patrick MacNee of &lt;em&gt;“The Avengers” &lt;/em&gt;fame …my hero) they might take a dim view of my involvement in anything skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other medium character roles and bit parts too. Back then in the larval days of paranormal programming, no one ever questioned whether I was real or not. They wanted what I was performing at the time to sell their program. Again, this is not meant as an excuse for what I did, just a grim reality of what I was dealing with. The producers and writers of those early shows could care a fig about how the trick was done, who might believe or who was getting conned. They wanted shock value and I gave it to them. The infomercial I did for &lt;em&gt;“The Psychic Revival Network”&lt;/em&gt; with Nell Carter and Eric Estrada was a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;foray into the darkest underbelly of exploited woo and caused a huge uproar with both magicians at The Magic Castle and the head honchos at The Skeptical Inquirer. It was a time when both sides wanted nothing to do with me and is detailed in my book  &lt;em&gt;“Psychic Blues”&lt;/em&gt; …hence the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that bittersweet experience allowed me to learn firsthand the tricks of the infomercial trade close-up and personal. Perhaps a bit too close-up and personal for some people! Convincing the real world psychic market that I was the best they were going to find while remaining skeptical was an arduous but exhilarating experience. I walked both sides of the street and learned  a hell of a lot. There was no way I could have gotten that kind of “on the job” education at a Skeptic’s Toolbox. I climbed to the top of the dung heap, took a look around and came running back down the mountain with my tail between my legs. You won’t see any of that crap on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Truth!,”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt; but I mention this period only to underscore the fact that scaling that mountain gave me the confidence to know that anybody who really wanted to could become the World’s Greatest Psychic if they had enough chutzpah, no conscience whatsoever and the evil mind necessary to con a nation of the bereaved and the horribly gullible. I moved on rather quickly after that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two episodes I did of &lt;em&gt;“Exploring the Unknown;” &lt;/em&gt;one on ”psychic readings” and the other on seances were both excellent barometers of where I was heading back then. Working skeptically with the  producer of that series; Star Price, gave me the creds that paved the way for my break on &lt;em&gt;“Bullshit.”&lt;/em&gt;  Thanks Star, wherever you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Penn-and-teller-bullshit" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Penn-and-teller-bullshit3-225x231.jpg" alt="Penn-and-teller-bullshit" width="225" height="231"&gt;Penn Jillette’s introduction to my work on the premiere episode of &lt;em&gt;“Bullshit: Talking to the Dead” &lt;/em&gt;where he labeled me a “reformed con artist” smarted a little when I first heard it, but over the years I have grown to accept that was pretty much what I was in the eyes of serious skeptical people like Randi, Shermer and Andrus. The work I did with the line producer on &lt;em&gt;“Bullshit” &lt;/em&gt;still stands as the single most important piece of video I have to date. On that show, all the training and work I had done in the past as a magician, mentalist and medium (in that order) were finally put to the right use I was always aiming for. Seeing how that show was skillfully edited to expose a fake medium of the worst order was one of the most totally satisfying show-biz experiences of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long and winding road. Since I first started doing mentalism and seance work, I have always held a skeptical view. How could I not have been skeptical? After all, &lt;em&gt;I’m a magician.&lt;/em&gt; It’s all a trick! The financial inducements offered from the Other Side were always a mighty tempting piece of low hanging fruit to avoid. It’s sad, but there’s not much money in telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least not yet anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what would happen if someone like John Edward decided to come clean?  Wheww. Now that would be worth watching, wouldn’t it? Don’t hold your breath. Sometimes I walk down the street and look at all the stupidity, corruption, criminality, dishonesty and waste and just wonder if putting myself out there is really worth all the hassle and trouble. As critical thinkers, are we thought of as dangerous intellectuals in a society where thinking rationally seems to be avoided at all costs and brains have atrophied? We are often targets for ridicule and mockery. Why not just sit back and let the idiots who so clearly outnumber us fight it out amongst themselves and just accept that this is the way it’s going to be?&lt;img title="accidents-thumb" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/accidents-thumb-225x141.jpg" alt="accidents-thumb" width="225" height="141"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, I can’t do that! If I have to shout from the rooftops and end up in a detention camp behind barbed-wire one day – so be it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Truth!”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;tells it like it has always been deep down in my heart of hearts. It is the truth as I have come to know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talented sixteen year old son Miles Wilson did a really marvelous job editing together all the pieces to under 8:55 to get in the Youtube restriction of nine minutes. Thanks again Miles. I’m very proud of this kid of mine. He’s going places. His choice of color schemes and music cues hits just the right notes. There could have been much more, but Miles instinctively knew what to put in and what to leave out. It was a great bonding experience for the both of us. If he harbored any doubts about where his father is coming from, what I stand for and what I have been trying to say for the last twenty years, those thoughts are now forever banished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that everyone who goes to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2jqmPgVY"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asA2jqmPgVY&lt;/a&gt; will feel the same way after seeing &lt;strong&gt;“The Truth!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain: The past few years, people have Google-searched for the term “Humanism” during the fall, winter, and spring.  But not so much over the summer months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t happen when you search for atheist/atheism.  Even with “Humanist,” the contrast isn’t as stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know why that is? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then lots of comments ensued, and I found particularly revealing &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_08/019409.php"&gt;this one,&lt;/a&gt; from “Hannah”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will say, once again, that it’s insulting to continually read from progressive commenters here and other places that I must be a “crazy” who believes in “fairy tales”, etc. because I am a Christian. For the record, I have a degree in science (from a highly-regarded state university known for its science programs), have worked as a research assistant, am always trying to learn more about the natural world. The Christian denomination I belong to and many others are not like the fundies, and in fact are appalled at what those folks are doing. Many of us speak out against their un-Christian and other actions that harm their children (re education), the country and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that Hannah is our ally in the cause of better public acceptance of science–and I for one, am glad for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249764380868"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/08/awesome_bioengineering_the_liv.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/471a30454a7e1891</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Awesome bioengineering: the living bridges of Cherrapunji</title><published>2009-08-08T13:09:01Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T13:09:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/08/awesome_bioengineering_the_liv.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In north east India, bridges aren't built - they're grown!

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with news headlines, there was not enough space to accommodate “Extinct Walking Bat Found; Upends an Evolutionary Theory” and so we removed “an,” thinking that readers’ would fill in the blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it seems that some readers filled the blank with “all” as opposed to “an.” 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would that they used “explanation” or “account” rather than “theory” in the first place.  However, kudos to NatGeo News for modifying the headline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(However, the link from &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/index.html" rel="external "&gt;NatGeo News’ front page&lt;/a&gt; still has the “upends” language.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==================================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;National Geographic News&lt;/em&gt; seems to be slipping into the &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; mode of sensationalist science headlines.  In 1999 it was taken in by the &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/03/photogalleries/april-fools-day-hoaxes/photo3.html" rel="external "&gt;fabricated Archaeoraptor fossil&lt;/a&gt;.  Now in &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090807-walking-bat.html" rel="external "&gt; National Geographic News&lt;/a&gt; we see this bizarre headline:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extinct Walking Bat Found; Upends Evolutionary Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how is evolutionary theory upended?  It appears that instead of acquiring the walking habit via loss of flight due to lack of predators, the lesser short-tailed bat of New Zealand inherited its walking habit from Australian ancestors who walked.  To be fair, the reporter, Carolyn Barry in Sydney, did a quite respectable job with no hint of the sensationalism injected by the headline writer.  How the Hell finding a potential ancestor for an extant species “upends evolutionary theory” is beyond me.  Shame on you, National Geographic News.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that there is something inexplicable in humans that draws us toward destruction.  I don’t understand it, but I feel it very strongly.  Yes, I am fully aware that it is ridiculous to become excited by a tornado siren, and idiotic to run outside looking for funnel clouds, yet I am unable to stop myself doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;

Mark Peters recently wrote about the &lt;i&gt;moist&lt;/i&gt; phenomenon for &lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/why-do-we-hate-the-word-%E2%80%9Cmoist%E2%80%9D/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, quoting Language Log discussion as well as a &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1857/"&gt;Word Routes column&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for the Visual Thesaurus. And now Mark's &lt;i&gt;Good&lt;/i&gt; column just got noticed by the folks at &amp;quot;Wait, Wait Don&amp;#39;t Tell Me!&amp;quot; on NPR — Mark and I were quoted in their &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111681597"&gt;"limericks" segment&lt;/a&gt; (skip to about 3:00 in):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And just so it's clear that I'm not pinning &lt;i&gt;moist&lt;/i&gt; aversion entirely on the "oi" diphthong, here is what I originally wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does &lt;em&gt;moist&lt;/em&gt; merit a Facebook group of haters, while &lt;em&gt;hoist&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;joist&lt;/em&gt; go unnnoticed? It&amp;#39;s more than just the sound of the word: the disliked words tend to have some basic level of ickiness… slimy stuff, bodily discharge, or other things that people would prefer not to think about. Icky words include &lt;em&gt;nostril&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;crud&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;pimple&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ointment&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;goiter&lt;/em&gt; share the "oi" sound with &lt;em&gt;moist&lt;/em&gt;: there must be something about that diphthong that gets under people's skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between 1066 and the Reformation there are only about six documented examples, and they seem rarer still in the preceding Anglo-Saxon period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, witchcraft trials were a feature of late Tudor and Stuart England, a good number of them actually occurring after the depiction of the witches in &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; (around 1603-07). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Indeed, one must note that, as with the fairies in &lt;em&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/em&gt; and the ghost in &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt;, Shakespeare's use of witches matched the worldview of his early-modern audience.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, a typical English witchcraft trial is more &lt;em&gt;Blackadder II&lt;/em&gt; than King Arthur.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And even then it was rare for witches to be prosecuted simply because they were witches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A witch was prosecuted, not because he or she was a witch, but because it was genuinely believed that witchcraft caused damage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this pre-Newtonian worldview, it was believed genuinely that the invisible force of magic was the cause and effect of the witch's malicious intents and the deaths and damage suffered by the victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prosecutions usually had to be paid for by the victims (not sponsored by any public body) and were expensive. Other than Matthew Hopkins, there were very few professional witch-finders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The defendant also had to be imprisoned in a gaol at the victim's expense until an assize, where a judge of sufficient seniority could conduct a trial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To bring a witchcraft prosecution was normally the last resort, to be used by a victim of perceived witchcraft when there seemed no other option for dealing with the damage being caused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if the prosecution got off the ground, it may not be successful. Judges such as Holt and Powell became famous for their enlightened approach - Powell even supposedly dismissing some extraordinary evidence with the cheerful remark that it was actually not unlawful for a person to fly through the air. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around 1700 there is a fall in prosecutions. There was still popular belief in witchcraft and magic, but it seems not in its causation for personal injury and property damage, and certainly not in the efficacy of the legal process to deal with it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And by 1736 almost all the witchcraft legislation is repealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will write another time on what happened next, especially in relation to fraudulent mediums (including the shameless fraudster Helen Duncan).&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-4971897129785815963?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249756240680"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=957">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63c0921d9a936307</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="body thetans"/><category term="bogan"/><category term="evil"/><category term="goat sacrifice"/><category term="god"/><category term="jediism"/><category term="kansas city"/><category term="scientology"/><category term="sydney andrews"/><category term="the dark side"/><category term="the force"/><category term="theodicy"/><title type="html">The Problem of Evil in Kansas City</title><published>2009-08-08T15:49:03Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T15:49:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/08/08/the-problem-of-evil-in-kansas-city/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I saw the article title “Why does God allow evil to succeed?” I was hoping that the &lt;i&gt;Kansas City Star&lt;/i&gt; was going for some sort of hard-hitting, Pulitzer-aspiring exposé involving several reporters and months of investigation, culminating in a 5-day multi-part series.  (”Part 3: Evil in Our Community.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once I &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1370809.html"&gt;clicked through&lt;/a&gt; I discovered that they simply allowed two local religious leaders to give insipid stock answers for a few paragraphs each.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we have Reverend Fran Cary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that God has allowed evil to succeed. Many will disagree with me when they think of the likes of our current economic crisis and crime rates. I will concede that evil does hold a major place in our world today; however, what we see now will not always be.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can sum this answer up as “the Bible says things are going to get better in the future, therefore evil has not technically ’succeeded’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clever trick that I hope to use in my own life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY&lt;br&gt;
Why do you treat me so terribly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JOEL&lt;br&gt;
In the future I’m going to treat you better, therefore I don’t actually treat you terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an alternative point of view, we visit Rabbi Mark Levin:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Knowing the divine mind is always tricky business. If we primarily know what God is not (via negative), then how can we possibly claim to understand God’s purposes for creation? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, who witnesses the big picture over centuries rather than our limited time and space perspective, understands how justice plays out when we do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can sum up this answer as “Evil doesn’t succeed, it only &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; like it does, mostly because of your poor cognitive skills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a clever trick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOSSMAN&lt;br&gt;
Your report doesn’t even make sense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JOEL&lt;br&gt;
It makes complete sense!  You just don’t understand it because of your limited time and space perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too bad that they didn’t ask the question to a broader variety of faith traditions, as it would have been more enjoyable reading answers like “because people aren’t sufficiently diligent about exorcising their body thetans” and “because naturally-occurring emotions like pain and anger inexorably lead to Bogan, the dark side of the Force,” and “because you didn’t sacrifice enough goats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll write a letter to the editor.

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, she deserves this.  She is an extraordinary actress.  Quite good at singing and dancing, too, and she is brilliant in a zillion other ways as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's get Ana this job!  We can do it!  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you are a blogger and want to remain my friend, you have to tell your readers to vote for Ana too.  ASAP, please.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By the way, the photo is by &lt;a href="http://photography.zvan.net/"&gt;Ben Zvan&lt;/a&gt;.  Ben is quite an excellent photographer, and Ana is quite beautiful (and astonishingly diverse in her looks, btw).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the most noticeable symptoms of autism involve trouble with the five senses. Sometimes people with the disorder are extremely sensitive -- cowering from sudden noises or bright lights, for example, or reacting aggressively to being touched. Others seek out extra sensation, such as through hand flapping....&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Nephtheid soft corals, a photographer's delight&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;BN Sullivan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is probably safe to say that when most people think of colorful things in the sea, tropical reef fishes come to mind first, followed perhaps by nudibranchs or sea stars. While most reef fishes, nudibranchs and sea stars are not only colorful but beautifully patterned, as a photographer, my favorites among colorful things in the sea are soft corals of the family Nephtheidae -- especially those of the genus Dendronephthya. They come in an incredible array of hues and color combinations, ranging from soft pastels to brilliant reds and golds...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of kids were thrown out because they said things or whatever, which is good because it shows that the whole point of the creation museum is to express, secure, and protect a particular point of view and to supress others.  For your entertainment, I've collected a handful of links from the event.  Please visit these links, and if you are a social neworking kinda person, digg-em-up or stumbleuponthem or whatever.  It would be very nice, would it not, if over the next few months anyone who sought information on the creation museum found lots of these stories on the top of the google food chain?  &lt;/p&gt;

It's absurd that people would be offended by the &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/08/there-are-at-least-two-atheists-in.html"&gt;least innocuous&lt;/a&gt; of the three common atheist ads, one that really doesn't make a statement any more profound than "atheists exist."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently people were refusing to board the bus, which I ascribed to the height of bigotry... and still mostly do, though now after reading an article in which the Iowa governor &lt;a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/gestalt/go.cfm?objectid=F06FCF0A-5056-B82A-3798CE05613FE62A"&gt;blathers on a about the "message it sent"&lt;/a&gt;, I wonder if an unfortunate confluence between the ad's layout and the standard DART artwork could have exacerbated the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;table width="270" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;caption align="bottom" style="width:270px"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;"All aboard, fellow atheists!"&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/resource/image_librarian/20090804/115207/BusAd1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:270px;height:230px" src="http://www.radioiowa.com/resource/image_librarian/20090804/115207/BusAd1.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the image on the right, the art on the bus makes it appear as though there is an arrow coming from the ad and pointing to the door of the bus.  Maybe this is a stretch, but I could almost see people taking this to imply that the full message was, "Don't believe in God?  You are not alone.  Come join us on this bus!"  If people took it that way, okay, I could see them being made uncomfortable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I letting my imagination run wild here?  The only reason it occurred to me is because when I first glanced at that picture, I thought to myself, "Huh, I haven't seen the version with the arrow before.  Where is that supposed to be pointing?  I don't get it..."  I didn't extrapolate it all the way to "Come ride the atheism bus!", but my fallible human brain had briefly perceived the arrow as being part of the ad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, any reasonable person, even a theist, ought to quickly realize the arrow had nothing to do with anything.  But given that some people are so fucking crazy they won't even &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/religion/666bill.asp"&gt;buy something if the cost comes to $6.66&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps some of the Krazy Kristians thought it would be bad luck, maybe even inviting a lightning bolt from the clear blue sky, if they were to even briefly stand so that an arrow was pointing at them unintentionally implying a disbelief in God?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wouldn't make me any less pissed if this is true, but it would make me slightly less confused...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-8108757673621138068?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249740401292"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/08/amazing-super-powers/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75243c85a46aef17</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Amazing Super Powers!</title><published>2009-08-08T14:00:09Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T14:00:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/08/amazing-super-powers/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been thinking about the taxonomic distribution and adaptive significance (if any) of spots and stripes, I recalled that my cat, Peyton (see &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/do-animals-have-morality-for-i-will-consider-my-cat-peyton-a-response/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/sympathy-for-the-human-further-consideration-of-my-cat-peyton/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), had some pattern elements quite reminiscent of tigers (beyond being a tiger tabby– the “tiger” stripes of tabby cats are not very like the stripes of tigers).  So I went to the &lt;a href="http://www.racinezoo.org/"&gt;Racine Zoo&lt;/a&gt; to look at &lt;a href="http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-152-01-0001.pdf"&gt;the tiger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/08/caturday-felid-11/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/DntjngU9k0g/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particular pattern element that seemed tiger-like was the striping on the inside of her legs, which is not well seen on the tiger here.  I was more intrigued by the fact that along the back, some of the stripes of the tiger form rosette-like ovals (rosettes are found in leopards, jaguars, and young lions), which can be seen in this photo (blurred by the glass keeping me and the tiger separated).&lt;/p&gt;

One found that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090803091917.htm"&gt;increased pollution in urban streams leads to increased mosquito populations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Luis Fernando Chaves, a post-doctoral researcher at Emory University, and his team discovered mosquitoes in abundance in a sewage-contaminated stream in Atlanta, but rarely in a nearby clean stream. They also found that mosquitoes were largest in streams with high levels of organic minerals – in this case, nitrogen and phosphorous – that originated from the sewage treatment plants.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of sewage runoff is a major one &lt;a href="http://blog.mlive.com/watershedwatch/2008/08/beach_closings_in_michigan_on.html"&gt;here in Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;img title="closed beach sign" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/closed-beach-2.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=118" alt="closed beach sign" width="150" height="118"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our cities use the same pipes for sewer water and storm runoff.  This means that in a heavy storm, excess water–with all that sewage too–goes right into the watershed.  This usually means the Great Lakes or other bodies of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs posted warning against swimming because of high fecal bacterial counts are a pretty common sight here.  Sadly, because of Michigan’s state budget woes, the &lt;a href="http://michigan.gov/deq/0,1607,7-135-3313_3682_4136-213532--,00.html"&gt;annual required report of wastewater release has been suspended&lt;/a&gt;, effective April 2009.  Right now, there is simply not enough staff to monitor our water safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaves’ work suggests a double whammy–all those bacteria are wonderful food supplies for the bacteria that feed mosquitoes. And the mosquitoes are bigger, which means they can live longer–and have a better shot at transmitting a mosquito-borne disease, of which &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/list_mosquitoborne.htm"&gt;there are many&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read some research about storm runoff closer to home in the &lt;a href="http://www.iaglr.org/jglr/journal.php"&gt;Journal of Great Lakes Research&lt;/a&gt;–here’s a couple of representative papers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/grid-of-disputation.jpeg" width="400" height="408" alt="grid-of-disputation.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context is the recent &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/numbers_and_nelson_dislocate_s.php"&gt;bloggingheads between Paul Nelson and Ron Numbers&lt;/a&gt;. It was a painful display, and the problem was that Nelson is an irredeemable kook, a young earth creationist well into the Red Zone of Crackpots in the diagram, yet none of his lunacy was engaged — he was treated as if he were a sensible person, with meritable ideas deserving serious consideration, when nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sean makes a somewhat different point: that it is a bad idea for critics to engage the very worst of the opposition, and to then congratulate themselves on their success in fighting off the enemy. We should be wrestling with the Green Zone of Worthy Opponents, not wasting our time with crackpots!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is definitely considerable truth in that. Non-crackpot arguments are more challenging and require more thought, and are ultimately more satisfying. However, there is a problem when the focus is on an issue rather than an individual. Some issues, and I would put evolution in this category, don't match this model well. While the issue is real and red-hot in the culture, the Green Zone of Worthy Opponents is unfortunately rather underpopulated. There is &lt;i&gt;no one&lt;/i&gt; in the green box. So what should we do? Simply ignore the mobs of people populating the red box?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of a Worthy Opponent, Sean mentions Ken Miller, and I&amp;#39;d agree…except that he&amp;#39;s only a worthy opponent on the issue of tactics in science education, but on the topic of evolution, he&amp;#39;s solidly in the Blue Zone of Friends. An argument with Miller on evolution would be really, really boring, because we&amp;#39;d just sit around agreeing with each other. While Sean has offered a useful model for thinking about strategy, it leaves out a significant situation in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don't feel like sitting back and twiddling my thumbs for a few years because Ken Ham is way too inane to deserve my attention. He's too successful as a con artist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/the_dilemma_of_the_anti-creati.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/yXE9tWxHDIA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249739559191"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/the_president_of_the_united_st_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf65c99c8c33e1d1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The President Of the United States Announces That He Will Resign</title><published>2009-08-08T14:00:50Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T14:00:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Uxz2pw7l2Ag/the_president_of_the_united_st_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/the_president_of_the_united_st_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this day in 1974.

This is the student who was kicked out; I was with him when he was pulled aside, and can verify that he was doing nothing but engaging in quiet conversation with a small group of us godless atheists when Mark Looy arbitrarily singled him out and took him aside to tell him stories about how unruly he had been. It was genuinely bizarre. As you can see in the clip made as we were standing outside, there was no shouting, no disruption, no rudeness at all going on — they simply plucked Derek out of the group and told him he was a bad boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/expelled_from_the_creation_mus/looy_rodgers.jpeg" width="400" height="613" alt="looy_rodgers.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/A4ThvM9BKZU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not shown is the other stuff that went on at the same time. While Looy had Derek off to the side, their head of security hovered about and tried to interpose himself between Looy and all the cameras aimed at him…an impossibility, since there was a whole arc of watchful atheists around them. At one point he gestured to one of the uniformed guards and sent him to escort one attendee with a large, high-quality video camera off the premises — this happened to be a fellow who was there making a documentary about atheists, who had been careful to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; directly participate and who was certainly not wearing any godless apparel. The creationists are certainly brilliant at PR, aren't they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say that all of the atheists were well behaved and civil, that the only behavior the museum staff could possibly have complained about is that we engaged in quiet criticism, and that the only bad behavior was by people like Looy and the noticeably edgy security guards, who we could tell were looking for an excuse to throw all the people laughing at their joke of a "museum" out. I think Derek was simply their chosen sacrificial lamb, used as an excuse to vent their failed expectations for a ferocious confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last irony: after expelling a few of our people for imaginary infractions, Looy came up to me with their photographer to ask to take my picture, presumably to put on Ken Ham's blog. I let him, of course, but I expect they'll also use it to let their security know who I am, in case I should make future invasions. (Which is not likely, by the way. I think I got enough.)&lt;/p&gt;

There was a room with a small collection of dinosaur models and skeleton casts, and they each had little panels describing the specimen…just like a real museum! Then you read them, and the weirdness sinks in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/a_little_taste_of_the_strangen/weird_panel.jpeg" width="400" height="147" alt="weird_panel.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that &amp;quot;Diet&amp;quot; specifies &amp;quot;after the Fall&amp;quot; — that&amp;#39;s because everything was a vegetarian before Adam and Eve ate the apple, since there was no death anywhere in the universe (which implies, apparently, that in their version of Christian theology, plants are dead). That&amp;#39;s not the weirdest thing, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the part that I found most amusing is the date. This is a Jurassic ceratosaur, so it says that this is from the Jurassic (~2348 BC). There were other specimens from other geological eras, and they would say "Upper Cretaceous (~2348 BC)" and "Lower Cretaceous (~2348 BC)". I'm sure that if they had some Cambrian specimens there, they would have also said "(~2348 BC)".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the geology even matter to them if they're just going to ignore it all and compress everything into one year, a year given with such remarkable specificity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t care about the geology, what about the history? All but 7 people are exterminated in 2348 BC, by their accounting, yet we know that in that century, we have the establishment of the Akkadian empire in Mesopotamia, the sixth dynasty in Egypt, the founding of major cities in the Indus valley and Korea…we have archaeological and historical records that show business as usual, with no one noting a massive annihilation of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; is like that — it&amp;#39;s a succession of assertions that flout the evidence, but does so in a &lt;i&gt;style&lt;/i&gt; that is simply parroted from legitimate museums.

She is a polyamorist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As atheists, many of us have faced some level of negative reaction from those around us, on account of our deviation from our culture’s expected norms.  I’ve found that atheists, in general, tend to support GLBT rights and other civil rights issues despite opposition by an offended religious majority. After all, atheists have no religious inhibitions that lead them to view certain deviations from the norm as anything immoral or harmful to society.  Atheists know what it’s like to be demonized and hated by those who fear us for our differences.  I’d like to call your attention to another group of people — a group even deeper in the “closet” than atheists — who could use your support: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory"&gt;polyamorists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyamory is a catch-all term that describes any relationship that involves more than two “loves” in a romantic/sexual context.  It includes polygamy in both its traditional forms (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny"&gt;polygyny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry"&gt;polyandry&lt;/a&gt;), as well as other patterns of relationships, such as those that only include people of the same sex and those that involve all partners being sexually linked to one another.  Having multiple significant others is usually associated with fundamentalist Mormon groups, at least in America, as various polygamists who illegally marry underage girls make the news now and again.  It’s easy to forget that polygamy isn’t unique to Mormons — it’s still practiced in many areas of the world, including Middle-Eastern and African countries.  Still, there are stigmas attached to those practices too, due to their association with the abuse of women and their incompatibility with most modern Christian beliefs about relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What many people don’t know is that there is a fairly secretive population of people in the Western world who practice polyamory — not for religious reasons, and not for the purposes of having orgies, but rather because they have found that it’s the kind of relationship that makes them happiest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the term “polyamory” is broad, I’m not focusing here about people who have “open relationships,” a relationship style that allows partners to have outside sex as an agreed-upon part of their relationship.  I would like to concentrate on so-called “poly-fidelitous” families who are committed to one another for the long haul.  Groups of three or more people who are attached by romantic and sexual bonds (although not all people in the relationship are necessarily sexually involved) exist as strong, stable units.  They raise children together, they often all share a house, and they usually have to hide their relationships to at least some degree.  These relationships can include a wide variety of formats — two couples where the women are both sexually involved with both men (or vice versa), two men involved with the same woman but not with each other (or vice versa), three members of the same sex all sexually involved, and many more configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyamorists cannot legally marry more than one of their partners (and if all members of the relationship are of the same sex, they probably can’t even get that much recognition), because our laws don’t accommodate such arrangements.  People in relationships with multiple partners are sometimes left without access to health insurance, visitation rights, and even custody rights due to cultural prejudice and current laws.  Would new laws have to include limits to avoid abuse by people trying to “cheat the system” in areas like citizenship and health care?  Certainly.  Is it possible to recognize and legally legitimize these relationships while blocking opportunities for that kind of abuse?  Again, I think the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some polyamorists see themselves as having a polyamorous “orientation,” but I would guess that’s a minority position.  Most simply acknowledge that humans are complicated animals who aren’t always fulfilled by or equipped to handle monogamy.  Different people will find that different types of relationships make them happy — some people can’t stand the thought of sharing their partner, and others are completely happy to see their partner in love with another person, with most people falling somewhere in-between.  Polyamorous relationships form in many ways, with some people knowing from a young age that they want more than one partner in life, and others deciding to include someone new in an already long relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most members of polyamorous relationships and families aren’t activists for reform — they would be assuming too much risk by being publicly “out,” and they are often too busy with the demands of extra spouses and children to spend time organizing rallies or writing petitions.  They are likely to be “out” to their friends and families about their unusual relationships, but they fear letting co-workers, employers, teachers, and other public figures find out.  They have to face a difficult choice: face the ramifications of telling someone their secret, or lying about something that’s very central in their lives.  Many poly families pass one or more members off as “friends” or “housemates” which can become painful and limiting over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legalization of polygamy is something that’s often mentioned by gay rights opponents as the next step of a slippery slope that leads to people marrying their pet lizards or underage children.  It’s not something that most people see as a serious civil rights issue, but it’s taken quite seriously by those of us who live in such relationships.  We’re consenting adults, choosing our own path in life, and we have nothing to be ashamed of ethically.  Still, we’re often essentially forced to hide in a culture that considers us adulterous, immoral and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the legalization of polygamy in America won’t happen for a long time — if it ever happens.  I’ve accepted the fact that I’ll be old and gray if I live long enough to see the day when I can be married to both my partners, but the first step towards that ultimate goal is awareness.  Legalization aside, the important issue here is tolerance (and hopefully general acceptance) that the poly community hopes to gain in society.  We’d like to be honest about our relationships without fearing hate or reprisals at work.  We’d like to be seen as perhaps a quirky, but normal part of our neighborhoods and our countries.  We don’t want to be demonized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m asking here is that you will remember, in your conversations about civil rights, the struggle facing polyamorous families, and bring up the topic of plural marriage — not as part of a slippery slope, but as a rational extension of marriage rights and a way to make our society a more equal place for those who choose to live in ways that might not match the religious right’s morality.  I hope that when topics like relationships, marriage and family come up you’ll spread the knowledge that polyamorous families exist.  Every person who learns about polyamory and comes to accept it as something non-threatening brings us one person closer to a world where polyamorous people won’t have to “come out” or fear exposure — a world where we’ll just be another accepted part of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested in learning more about different forms of polyamory practiced today, the challenges that polyamorous relationships face, the benefits they bring, and the general facts about the polyamorous population, take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.lovemore.com/"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;’s FAQs about polyamory, &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/209164"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://forum.friendlyatheist.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;amp;t=1264"&gt;post that I made&lt;/a&gt; on our Friendly Atheist Forum a few months ago, outlining some key definitions and distinctions within polyamory.  I would also recommend the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157344295X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=157344295X"&gt;Opening Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Tristan Taormino&lt;/strong&gt; as an excellent resource for people interested in practicing polyamory or understanding polyamory better.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So listen to &lt;a href="http://michaelchapman.co.uk/"&gt;Michael Chapman&lt;/a&gt; singing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/Memphis%20in%20Winter.mp3"&gt;Memphis in Winter&lt;/a&gt; while I give you what you gave for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/Memphis%2520in%2520Winter.mp3" width="300" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reached:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;101&lt;/b&gt; separate donations,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at least &lt;b&gt;$3,260&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;new donations&lt;/i&gt; pledged,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;over &lt;b&gt;80 additional charity hours&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many great additional donations, such as food, clothing, shoes, diapers, medicine, and many other philanthropic offers!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
And so, as promised, you're getting what you paid for.  Here's how I do it (and with all images, just click for the full size):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0490.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0490.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0490.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt; it's important to wash your hair &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; if you're going to donate it to charity.  Shampoo, conditioner, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; letting it dry properly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0504.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0504.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0504.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt; put that thing in a ponytail!  If you're going to send it off to locks of love, it needs to be dry and either braided or in a ponytail.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0506.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0506.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0506.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt; shave it!  There are no two ways about it, you've just gotta hold your breath and take it all off.  Want some more pictures?  Of course you do:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0508.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0508.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0511.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0511.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0511.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that leaves me pretty bald.  But, I didn't say "pretty bald" in my challenge, did I?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0512.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0512.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0512.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4:&lt;/b&gt; might as well give you the &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt; shave that you were looking for; no sense in not going full tilt for this one!  Goodbye, last remnant of hair!  That leaves us with this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0513.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0513.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0513.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice!  So now that that's done, you've just got one more step to finish this off:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0515.jpg"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until/GEDC0515.jpg" width="500" alt="GEDC0515.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5:&lt;/b&gt; place the hair for donation in a stamped envelope and mail it to &lt;a href="http://locksoflove.org/"&gt;Locks of Love&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;b&gt;234 Southern Blvd, West Palm Beach, FL 33405&lt;/b&gt;!  Is my hair suitable for donation?  I'm not sure, but the worst thing that happens is they can't make a wig out of it, and so they sell it instead.  Still, not such a bad thing to do!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, finally, there was the issue of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/a_charity_extra_going_above_an.php"&gt;going above and beyond&lt;/a&gt;, and responding to the challenge that I &lt;b&gt;wax my chest&lt;/b&gt; for an extra $1,000 to the charity of my choice, which was &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/"&gt;KIVA&lt;/a&gt;.  All I needed to do was to get my chest and stomach waxed, and to videotape it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, as you can see from the pictures above, the waxing has already happened!  I found a fabulous professional -- &lt;a href="http://portlandwaxing.com/"&gt;Lisa Huppe&lt;/a&gt; -- who runs &lt;a href="http://portlandwaxing.com/"&gt;portlandwaxing.com&lt;/a&gt;.  That's all she does: waxing.  She not only does &lt;a href="http://portlandwaxing.com/Aboutwaxing.html"&gt;all the standard waxing services&lt;/a&gt;, but has a full line of &lt;a href="http://portlandwaxing.com/fortheguys.html"&gt;men's services&lt;/a&gt; as well.  The whole thing took less than half-an-hour, and was much, much less painful than I had any right to expect.  And if you ever need a wax and you're anywhere near Portland, I &lt;i&gt;highly&lt;/i&gt; recommend her.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those of you who are into the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude"&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt;, you're welcome to watch the video of the waxing itself:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/tBjUYGaw2l4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all of your charitable support, and congratulations to us all for meeting/exceeding our charitable goals!  (Over &lt;b&gt;$4,000&lt;/b&gt; total, all combined!  Amazing!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/weekend_diversion_giving_until.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249719611912"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/clock_quotes_376.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/043d322c22a07dd9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-08-08T08:54:26Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T08:54:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/kY9wdQ3SyJY/clock_quotes_376.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/08/clock_quotes_376.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'll sleep when I'm dead. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You are not alone” although apparently they did try to convince the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers to consider a different ad.  I’m not sure how you can possibly think of one less offensive than what they already had, but the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers said no anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better than that, the bus company claims to be making strides towards improving their advertising standards so that this doesn’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DART will also be updating advertising policies to clearly communicate its position to uphold both civil liberties and the protection of citizens from that which is obscene or profane, [DART General Manager Brad] Miller said.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good, at least this company is run by non-bigots.  Unfortunately, we still can’t say the same about Governor Chet Culver.  He still needs to be voted out of office.&lt;/p&gt;

You told me that a-liens really exist&lt;br&gt;
you met them and swooned in/with elation&lt;br&gt;
they took you to Pluto and boy, were they pissed&lt;br&gt;
demoted while on their vacation…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your details were﻿ crazy&lt;br&gt;
your memory’s hazy&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know how you can believe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the details so hazy&lt;br&gt;
the memory crazy&lt;br&gt;
guess which-one-of-us is deceived?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;told me the Bible could show me the way&lt;br&gt;
and get me﻿ ahead of this game&lt;br&gt;
but it’s written by committee and based on hearsay&lt;br&gt;
and it’s 1.sexist 2. and racist 3. and lame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the timeline is hazy&lt;br&gt;
the stories are crazy&lt;br&gt;
I don’t know how you can believe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the timeline so hazy&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.biologicinstitute.org/" rel="external "&gt;Biologic Institute&lt;/a&gt; is the research arm of the Disco ‘Tute, promising (but not yet delivering) cutting edge intelligent design research.

&lt;p&gt;In it, Aviv writes of infiltrating - and that's an ugly word, but apropos - a chapter of a group called the Child Evangelism Fellowship during the summer of 2008. The chapter comprised 40 young missionaries who "roamed the housing projects of Connecticut," accosting unsupervised young children and pressuring them to accept Jesus into their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Aviv: "The goal was salvation, but the missionaries rarely used that long word. They employed monosyllabic language and avoided abstract concepts and homonyms. ‘Holy' was a problem, the missionaries said, as children thought it meant ‘full of holes.' ‘Christ rose from the dead' was also tricky because children mistook the verb for a flower."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>jrefmail@randi.org (Brandon K.

One of the cover stories is by Cecilia McCarton and Mary Jane Weiss of The McCarton Foundation, “Meeting the Needs of Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder,” in which they state that most parents of younger children on the spectrum recognize that “their children have access to far better services than any previous group of individuals with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:153px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/aging1.jpg" alt="Image: Musclebomb.com" width="143" height="74"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Musclebomb.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all anecdotal, but I agree. Here in New York the legend of Willowbrook still runs deep through the oldest — and often most active — of parents of autistic individuals. The agency that has always rolled up its sleeves highest to provide Alex with services was started years ago by parents fed up with how their kids were being treated. Ditto a parents’-lecture group I work with. Some parents look back to that earliest efforts in the early days of recognizing and helping the autistic the same way the Minutemen must’ve looked back with pride around 1795.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, McCarton and Weiss add, “The reality changes and this hope fades as children with autism age. Services that were an entitlement in childhood are rare.” Those services falter just as a desire for independent living — the Holy Grail from the parents’ perspective, I can attest — looms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can believe it. My whole life there’s been little money for anything except another box store, and after last fall’s crash I wonder if spending on anything without a guaranteed bottom-line payback — like, say, challenged young adults — is ever going to be exactly the same. A society that chooses to call itself compassionate is going to face some hard choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hope I have, however, is that the tide that has lifted the children will continue to rise along with the numbers and along with the need. Sometimes reality changes for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the title of a recent paper by Riikka Mottonen and Kate Watkins&amp;#39; in The Journal of Neuroscience, Motor Representations of Articulators Contribute to Categorical Perception of Speech Sounds, the data reported are, unfortunately, uninterpretable.  Here&amp;#39;s the long answer:  Mottonen and Watkins asked subjects to perform syllable identification (which of two syllables did you hear?) and syllable discrimination (are the two syllables you just heard same or different).  The stimuli were place or voice onset time continua and the design followed a standard categorical perception (CP) experimental design.  These tasks were performed either pre-rTMS of after rTMS was applied to the lip area of left motor cortex.  I will focus here on the discrimination task.  The critical condition was when the subjects discriminated a lip-related sound (ba or pa) from a non-lip-related sound (da or ga).  They report that discrimination across a category boundary was less accurate after TMS to motor lip areas than before.  Specifically, for the ba-da stimuli, the mean proportion of &amp;quot;different responses&amp;quot; to cross category (i.e., physically different) syllables was .73 pre-TMS and .58 post-TMS; similar findings are reported for the pa-ta stimuli.  Discriminations that did not involve lip-related sounds (ka-ga or da-ga) were not affected by stimulation, nor was lip-related speech sound discrimination affected by motor hand area stimulation.So how is this uninterpretable? At risk of becoming a methods curmudgeon (it&amp;#39;s probably too late), this paper, like many I&amp;#39;ve discussed here, used the wrong analysis.  Instead of using an unbiased measure, d-prime, they used a biased measure, proportion of different responses. This renders the data uninterpretable because we can&amp;#39;t actually tell whether TMS affected the perception of the speech sounds (an interesting possibility) or the subjects&amp;#39; response biases (a less interesting possibility).  It&amp;#39;s not the authors&amp;#39; fault though.  Speech studies of this sort have used the wrong measure for decades.  Does this make the entire field uninterpretable?  Well... I&amp;#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions.To illustrate the problem, consider the graph below which plots d-prime values as a function of a range of possible hit rate values (hits in this study would be correctly identifying same trials as same) for two constant false alarm (FA) rates corresponding to the pre- and post-TMS values reported by Mottonen and Watkins.  FA was calculated simply by subtracting the proportion of different response values from 1, i.e., proportion of different responses (to different trials) is the proportion of correct rejections (the two stimuli are not the same), and FAs is just the inverse of correct rejections.  d-prime is a bias corrected measure of discrimination where 0=chance and anything over 3 is real good.  Notice from the graph that depending on the proportion of hits, the d-prime value can range anywhere between 0 to almost 5!  But this is true for any constant FA rate, of course, as discrimination ability is only meaningful by looking at the relation between hits and FAs.  Think of it this way.  If you have a FA rate of 0 (perfect performance on different trials) that seems fantastic, but at the same time, if your hit rate is also 0, well then you clearly just like to say &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; all the time no matter what you hear.  A FA rate of 0 is only meaningful if you have a higher than 0 hit rate and the higher the hit rate, the higher your d-prime score.  Notice too that because a given FA value can result any number of d-prime values depending on the hit rate there is virtually complete overlap in d-prime values for the two curves (except for the upper end).  This means that TMS could have had no affect whatsoever on the ability of subjects to discriminate lip-related speech sounds. For example, if the hit rate for pre-TMS was .7 and hit rate for post-TMS was .8 then the d-prime in both cases is approximately 2.5 -- no difference.  It is also possible that discrimination was worse prior to TMS than after TMS (e.g., if hit rates were .6 and .8 respectively)! I&amp;#39;m not saying that the study is necessarily wrong, or that TMS didn&amp;#39;t affect the perception of lip-related speech sounds.  What I&amp;#39;m saying is we can&amp;#39;t tell from these data.  Maybe once they calculate d-prime the data will show an even more impressive effect. But since we only have half of the information there is no way to know whether perception was affected: the findings are uninterpretable.   TThis study is potentially really important and very interesting.  As such, I would like to urge the authors to redo the analysis and publish an addendum in J. Neuroscience.  I certainly would like to know if it actually worked!ReferencesMottonen, R., &amp;amp; Watkins, K. (2009).

Lots of people have their own advice, their own stories, their own beliefs.  One fascinating discussion is about whether one must or will necessarily be hungry when eating right.  My contention is that most overweight people feel hungry, defined as a desire to eat more, if they have a negative calorie balance.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/palmds_bmi_tmi.php"&gt;As one super-hot physiologist&lt;/a&gt; has pointed out, there are ways to mitigate this.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say "mitigate" because I really think that there are some people who, if the follow the evidence and do everything right, are still going to feel pretty hungry.  The evidence does give us hints at how to help, though, and I hope Isis will lead me in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My writing, and hers as well, is an experiment---one between two professionals, one of whom hopes that making his struggle public may inspire or help others---but there are pitfalls to this type of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing in this exchange is aimed at &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.  Everyone is different.  Not everyone who's BMI is above a particular number needs to lose weight, and their are many safe and unsafe ways to approach diet and exercise---in other words, find your own professional, cuz me and Isis, we ain't it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did pretty well today.  My back was screwed up, but I did the stupid thing and took some medicine, lay down for a while, then acceded to PalKid's demand for a bike ride, which was long and involved actual physical work.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lunch was a yummy salad with a hard boiled egg on top and some local cantaloupe.  I had a snack of a some low-fat mozzarella cheese when I got home, but unfortunately, I did something wrong, got really hungry, and ate a pretty big (albeit healthy) dinner.  Kiddo wanted Japanese, and most of the local Japanese places are run by Koreans, and I had some rice noodles stir-fried with lots of veggies, which was surprisingly short on oil (but still an overly generous portion).  I'm also having a nice, cold beer tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, overall, I've eaten far less, and exercised far more than I normally do, and hopefully this will  be the new normal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's been some chatter in the blogosphere about what type of exercises achieve what goals, but my current exercise goal is to just do some, improve my strength, endurance, and self-esteem.  If it doesn't help me lose weight, I can live with that for now.&lt;br&gt;

These, for the most part, seem to be an important part of each society. They bring together the family and friends to celebrate various stages of ones life. They are a mechanism by which we can confer our status from one to another. And there are both secular and religious rites of passage. some of these include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Baptism&lt;br&gt;Circumcision&lt;br&gt;Communion&lt;br&gt;First haircut (first poop, first shoes, etc. babies get tons)&lt;br&gt;Birthdays&lt;br&gt;Sweet sixteen&lt;br&gt;Graduations (there are even preschool graduations now)&lt;br&gt;Bar Mitzvah&lt;br&gt;Thesis defense&lt;br&gt;Military rank advancements&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could go forever, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage"&gt; Wikipedia has a much larger list&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that we seem to crave these points of recognition. And why not? Other than physical mutilation, and accepting that people are religious, I don't think there is much controversy about any of these milestones of life. I was very proud the receive my PhD and celebrating it was a nice way to do so. I enjoy my birthdays too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;There is a very uncelebrated milestone that 95% of us go through (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/10/measles-mmr-vaccine"&gt;78% of you english folk&lt;/a&gt;). Vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Why don't we celebrate this? This is an awesome achievement over disease and death. Vaccinations has provided a completely new level of longevity. The diseases that use to plague humankind barely come into our daily conversation. Diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, flu. While people in industrialized nations still die from these diseases, usually due to a lack of vaccination, we as a society hardly think of these diseases as one of our ills anymore. We should be celebrating this achievement!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I propose a series of celebrations that align with the vaccination schedule your country uses. Perhaps in America we would celebrate the following events:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SnpDtipuotI/AAAAAAAABK4/TzP_l0I9Q0E/s800/IZSchedule_Childhood.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SnpDtHH1-3I/AAAAAAAABK0/V1ZV7yk2w6I/s800/IZSchedule_Childhood-thumb.jpg" height="155" width="380" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Immunion:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a small family affair that happens at two months old. The traditional Immunion ceremony is some well wish for strong health of the baby. It starts with the ceremonial washing of hands of all participants. It continues in dim light and silence with the mother holding the baby while the first round of injections are provided. While the child is usually crying at this time, a ceremonial bottle with one or two ounces of breast milk or formula is plied to the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Immunion:&lt;/strong&gt; This ceremony may be shared by close family, but also friends may come to this. This ceremony is held at around 4 months old. While it may be held at the doctors office, it may be more prudent to invite the doctor to the second Immunion so it can be done at home or other facilities that provide enough space for everyone. The Healthy, Happy and strong song is sung by all. This time the father holds the baby while the vaccinations are injected. Once again the baby might not be happy, but the ceremonial 2 ounce bottle of breast milk or forumula is given to the child again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Immunion&lt;/strong&gt;: This ceremony is often skipped, but may be celebrated. Usually it is done in the morning before the first nap. This is to symbolize the refreshing confidence of long term health that is so refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grand Immunion:&lt;/strong&gt; This ceremony happens just after the first birthday, although it may be combined with the first birthday if desired. At the grand immunion we are celebrating the largest barrage of disease fighting antibodies. The Grand Immunion is usually celebrated amongst family and friends. Although it is also encouraged to put a small ad in the paper that can be saved when the child is older as a keepsake of this wonderful celebration. Often, for the GI, presents are given to the child that are associated with strong heath, like books with pictures of people being strong in the face of adversity, sailors eating spinach, and other stories. Further, the needle of the vaccination is broken off and the syringe is saved as a memento. For this event they make purple syringes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminduction:&lt;/strong&gt; At the age of 5, the child is Terminducted. This is celebration of the end of the childhood vaccinations and lets the child know that he has entered a new and exciting time in his or her life. It is explained to the child how strong and robust he or she is with respect to some pretty nasty diseases. There is some training that goes into this ceremony before the actual event. The child must be able to recite all the diseases he is vaccinated against. He or she also explains why it is so good to vaccinate to increase the immunity of his whole community, a force everyone associated with the child can share in. The doctor administers the final immunizations with a gold plated syringe, the child recites the diseases he is immunized for from memory. A large bell, canon, or gong is sounded and the all the guests cheer: "Chigee Chigge Chee! Hize Hize Hize! [child's name] is now immunized!" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;A good time is had by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;The last and final celebration is usually just for girls, but it &lt;a href="http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/news/20081113/hpv-vaccine-gardasil-may-help-boys-men"&gt;may be used for boys also&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pappiloo:&lt;/strong&gt; Papiloo is a time of education and reflection. Usually its a bonding time between one or both parents and the child preparing for Pappiloo. The parent tells their 12-14 year old about how disease works, what viruses and bacteria are. They then go through the Pappiloo Book. This is a book that details various diseases like AIDS, Gonorrhea, Syphilis and Chlamydia, and others. It has pictures of the symptoms (they are pretty gross), and discusses how these diseases can be avoided. This book is shared with only the teenager and one or both parents. After the book is finished, goals and dreams of the teenager are discussed. Each desire and outcome that the teenager describes is jotted down and put into a Pappiloo box. The box is stored safely somewhere for the son or daughter to open in times of confusion about what to do with themselves scholastically or in their future careers. Most often Papiloo is celebrated by going on a trip to someplace that the teenager has never been before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Well, it was a thought anyway. :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/anthology/" title="Go to the nomination form"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3000/sba150x70.png" alt="Submit to Skeptical Blog Anthology 2009" width="150" height="70"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-6117097012764650288?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249698579444"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=952">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1aabdca0ab6a36a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="agbonniregun"/><category term="animal sacrifice"/><category term="ashe"/><category term="eric rassbach"/><category term="freedom of conscience"/><category term="goats"/><category term="ifa"/><category term="iphones"/><category term="jailbreaking"/><category term="lukumi"/><category term="orunmila"/><category term="payola"/><category term="pinball wizard"/><category term="product placements"/><category term="religious freedom"/><category term="religious liberty"/><category term="rock opera"/><category term="santeria"/><category term="smoking"/><category term="sudafed"/><category term="tobacco"/><category term="vote selling"/><title type="html">Why I Make Fun of Goat Sacrifice</title><published>2009-08-08T01:29:30Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T01:29:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2009/08/07/why-i-make-fun-of-goat-sacrifice/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;, lawyer Eric Rassbach has an op-ed piece explaining his latest case, in which he defended his client’s religious right to &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204908604574337071663453560.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"&gt;kill goats at his suburban house&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I then explain, often to dubious ears, that Mr. Merced is a priest of the Santería religion and must sacrifice goats in order to ordain new priests. Without goat sacrifice, his religion would die out. Sometimes my questioners nod in agreement, sometimes they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reaction I haven’t heard yet is “Oh, of course. What a great idea!” Yet that’s what anyone who takes religious liberty seriously should say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I don’t take “religious liberty” seriously, because I’m pretty sure that I’m not capable of commending his client.  The idea that you need to kill a goat in order to make someone a “priest” is &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt;, and I can’t imagine describing it as anything other than “stupid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Rassbach won his case:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Last week the federal Court of Appeals in New Orleans put itself on the side of freedom of conscience, ruling for Mr. Merced and telling the city he lives in–Euless, Texas–to let him start sacrificing goats again. The Court did not decide whether Mr. Merced’s beliefs were right or wrong, orthodox or unorthodox. It simply held that as long as he is not endangering public health or safety, the government had to leave those beliefs up to him and his gods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that such “freedom of conscience” were extended to the non-religious!  There are plenty of illegal things I’d like to do that don’t endanger public health or safety:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; buy &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12164593"&gt;more than 6 boxes of Sudafed&lt;/a&gt; at a time
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2009/02/15/apple-looking-to-keep-iphone-jailbreaking-protected-by-dmca.html"&gt;jailbreak&lt;/a&gt; my iPhone
&lt;li&gt; smoke plants that aren’t tobacco
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola"&gt;pay a radio station&lt;/a&gt; to play my rock opera about a blind pinball wizard, tentatively titled “Your Religion Is False”
&lt;li&gt; sell my &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/05/us/05vote.html?_r=1&amp;amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;emc=rss"&gt;absentee ballot&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt; get a &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10064059"&gt;product placement&lt;/a&gt; for my book on a French television program
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note to the authorities: I am not actually considering doing any of these, except maybe the payola and the French television placement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet no one wants to defend &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; freedoms, simply because my desire to do all these things is rooted in the common-sensical “I think they’d make my life better” rather than the ludicrous “the wisdom-spirit &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orunmila"&gt;Agbonniregun&lt;/a&gt;, second calabash to god, told me during my last &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%C3%A1"&gt;Ifá&lt;/a&gt; divination that I’m required to if I want access to a steady source of the divine life force &lt;i&gt;Ashe&lt;/i&gt; in the afterlife!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I will not be joining Rassbach on his anti-caprid crusade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249697949258"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/carnivals_33.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/38ba1a1ee73364b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Carnivals</title><published>2009-08-08T02:04:20Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T02:04:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/HT6gSTphSP8/carnivals_33.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/carnivals_33.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sfmatheson.blogspot.com/2009/08/carnival-of-evolution-14.html"&gt;The Carnival of Evolutoin 14 is at Quintessence of Dust.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He took a hiatus from blogging, but is now back at it with a vengeance at his &lt;a href="http://www.theexaminingroom.com" title=""&gt;new site&lt;/a&gt; which I warmly recommend you visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's post is interesting - and not just because it is partially about a PLoS ONE paper - &lt;a href="http://www.theexaminingroom.com/2009/08/exercise-and-weight-loss/" title=""&gt;Why Exercise is Not the Best Prescription for Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt; which fits perfectly within the ongoing discussion about weight-loss and dieting going on a couple of my SciBlings' blogs right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don't forget that a couple of years ago Chad went on a successful - and also highly public - diet: see his updates (each with some additional thoughts about dieting) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/03/post_1.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/04/thin_kills_1.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/06/im_not_fat_im_just_bigboned.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/06/the_scienceblogs_diet_midyear.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2006/09/scienceblogs_diet_update.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2008/01/the_scienceblogs_diet_year_two.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/blog/57"&gt;more by DeeTee here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the swine flu pandemic tightens its global grip, antivaccinationists far and wide are gearing up for their propaganda war against the H1N1 vaccine. Their objections, predictably enough, conform to the usual diet of antivaccine canards that they always employ to frighten people about vaccines, but the novelty of the current pandemic offers them unlimited scope for scaremongering among the millions of worried potential vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any valid reasons to have concerns over this flu vaccine? Well, possibly, but not to the extent the antivaccination lobby would have us believe. There are still issues that need to be resolved, some of which are strategic rather than scientific in nature such as whether the vaccine should be mandatory or not. Regarding the science it is as yet unclear exactly how protective the vaccine will be, and studies are under way to determine the correct balance between HA antigen dose and immunogenicity, which will influence both the incidence rate of reactions and also determine how effective it will be in the groups most in need of it. It may be that two doses are required for optimum protectiveness, and studies to look at this are under way. The technology used to produce vaccine is not new; essentially all that is being done is to tweak the antigenic components of the seasonal vaccine, which has a very good safety track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the antivaccine lobby are indicating that they are deeply concerned, and they wish all of us to share their concern to the point of refusing vaccination. Now any rational person with the slightest modicum of common sense will be able to dismiss as irrelevant their usual froth about “toxic” ingredients in the vaccines, but there are some reading their diatribes against flu vaccine who might be worried, particularly when “real science” is disingenuously quoted by the antivaccine crew to support their case. One such “valid” concern is the link between influenza vaccination and an uncommon neurological disorder, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the side effects reported after flu vaccine, GBS holds sway as the most prominent in the minds (and mouths) of the antivaccinationists. A direct causal relationship has never been clearly established between flu vaccines and GBS, but the link is biologically plausible and the available epidemiological evidence points to an association. The concerns about swine flu vaccine in particular first came to light when GBS affected over 500 people following a mass influenza vaccination programme that took place in the USA in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the true facts about GBS? Firstly, it must be made clear that the most common causes of the syndrome are naturally acquired infections (although other triggers are reported). Now all infections can trigger a host immunological response, but rarely in certain individuals this host response is misdirected to cause damage to the myelin coating of nerve cells, causing GBS. This process of demyelination results in weakness and paralysis, which can take months to resolve, and it can rarely be fatal (although much less so nowadays with the advent of treatments such as plasmapharesis and immunoglobulin infusions). There are a number of infections known to trigger GBS, &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; gastroenteritis being the best-known example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines, containing as they do microbiologically active agents, might reasonably be assumed to pose some risk since their action mimics that of the natural infections, hence the concerns about vaccine-induced GBS. This immune-mediated process might operate either through molecular mimicry, or through “bystander activation”, but clear evidence that these actually occur with flu vaccines is weak and inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976 there was an &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-0965.htm"&gt;outbreak of influenza&lt;/a&gt; among US servicemen stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey that resulted in several hundred clinical cases and one death. The strain identified was a novel Hsw1N1 “swine flu” virus, similar to the 1918 pandemic Spanish flu strain which killed half a million people. Fear that another 1918-type pandemic was about to occur prompted the authorities to begin mass vaccination and a total of 45 million Americans were vaccinated against swine flu. In fact there never was a significant outbreak, not because the population was protected by vaccine, but because transmission of the virus remained confined to Fort Dix by the infection control measures implemented at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the vaccination campaign, there was a rise in the numbers of GBS recorded that year, with 581 cases being reported by the CDC in Atlanta. This led to speculation that the vaccinations were responsible, but the number of reported cases was disputed since there was felt to be some bias in the collation of data and the criteria for diagnosing GBS. Subsequent reanalysis conducted by the CDC’s Immunisation Safety Branch rejected 29% of the reported cases of GBS. One of the possible theories as to why the vaccine might have caused GBS was that the vaccine had been contaminated with Campylobacter jejuni, since at that time this infection was common in poultry and the vaccine was produced in chick embryos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, there has been concern that influenza vaccines given for seasonal flu might cause the same problem, particularly when in the USA in 1994 when the numbers of cases of GBS rose to 74, having been only 37 the year before. These reports prompted The Institute of Medicine to set up a &lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/15625.aspx"&gt;Safety Review Committee&lt;/a&gt; to study the links between influenza vaccines and neurological syndromes. The IOM reviewed all available evidence regarding GBS post vaccination, for which there were many detailed analyses available. In 2003 they reported &lt;i&gt;“the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship between the 1976 Swine Influenza vaccine and GBS in adults.”&lt;/i&gt; However, the evidence for other years was &lt;i&gt;“inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship”&lt;/i&gt;. The estimated risk of GBS after flu vaccine is currently thought to be around 1 to 2 cases per million vaccinated persons per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An association between influenza season and a rise in the incidence of GBS &lt;a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Influenza,+Campylobacter+and+Mycoplasma+infections,+and+hospital...-a0156362177"&gt;has been noted before&lt;/a&gt;, with the suggestion that influenza infection itself might be a cause. However, it is often difficult to dissociate what might be due to influenza infection from what might be due to influenza vaccination – obviously both are common during flu season. As the authors of the study commented: &lt;i&gt;“Whether the associations [of GBS] with influenza are real or whether they reflect seasonal patterns in influenza vaccination is unclear.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of influenza was clarified in a &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/594124"&gt;recent French study&lt;/a&gt; published as a major article in the in-house journal of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. This not only looked at epidemiological data on GBS but also tested all the cases microbiologically to establish the causative agent. In 18% of GBS cases they investigated, influenza infection was shown to be the cause. They also estimated that the incidence of influenza-related GBS to be 4-7 cases for every 100,000 cases of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this evidence leave the antivaccine lobby’s claims about GBS and swine flu vaccine? Essentially nowhere. That GBS might be triggered by flu vaccine is possible; it certainly seems as though 33 years ago it may have done so with the vaccine produced at that time. Whether the current swine flu vaccine will do anything similar is questionable; flu vaccines produced since 1976 do not appear to have significantly raised the risks of GBS above the background noise level, and any epidemiological rise in GBS cases during the flu season may not be due to the vaccine but actually caused by influenza. In fact the most powerful argument in favour of continuing to have flu vaccine (thereby running a tiny, one or two in a million risk of GBS) is that flu itself is a relatively common cause of GBS, and would appear to cause it once in every 14,000 to 25,000 episodes of flu. Running the risks of a rare vaccine side effect is perfectly acceptable when the risks from not having the vaccine are much worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict that the supposed risk of GBS will be one of the more specious reasons bandied about by the antivaccine lobby in the coming months as a reason why we should avoid the flu vaccine. And it’s not just the rabid antivaccine websites promoting this view, there have already been articles in the “quality” UK papers questioning the value of vaccination, as exemplified by &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6722428.ece"&gt;this one in the Times&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Halvorsen, a prominent antivaccine proponent with his own new antivaccine book to promote (and profit from). He claims: &lt;i&gt;“The case for vaccinating millions of healthy adults against a disease that is no more unpleasant than a bad cold is questionable”&lt;/i&gt;.   This completely ignores the evidence that for certain susceptible groups, influenza infection may be extremely serious. Now I have looked after many patients who have died from influenza, but never anyone who died of “a bad cold”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen goes on to say this about widespread vaccination: &lt;i&gt;“We could expect hundreds of people to get GBS, some of whom will suffer permanent paralysis or die.”&lt;/i&gt;  If as many as 30% of the UK population receive the vaccine, and if the rates of GBS compare with those experienced after the USA 1976 flu vaccine programme (which is unlikely as there is no reason to anticipate the same rate of reactions now as there were in 1976), there might be between 166 and 200 cases attributable to vaccine (based upon the described risk of one case in 100,000-120,000 vaccinated persons). But if the rate of vaccine-associated GBS conforms to that thought to occur with more current flu vaccines (1-2 per million), we could expect only between 20 and 40 cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, any estimates of vaccine-associated GBS cases must be set against the risks of flu-associated GBS. If as many as 30% of the UK population get swine flu this autumn (as is widely predicted), we might anticipate around 800 cases of flu-induced GBS. One might reasonably conclude that, given all the available scientific evidence, having flu vaccine is actually a very logical and effective way to prevent GBS in a pandemic flu scenario. But I don’t expect antivaccine proponents like Halvorsen to appreciate this fact, since they only ever look at risks from the vaccine and never the risks from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind this antivaccine propaganda is entirely spurious, and like all of the other risks we are so solicitously warned about, the fears are manifestly unjustified. Of course vaccines can and will cause reactions; after all they are biologically active products. But the potential benefits of the influenza vaccine, particularly for those in higher risk groups, far outweigh the potential harm from reactions. The risks of problems such as vaccine-associated GBS are significantly less than the risk of influenza-induced GBS, and are miniscule compared to the serious risks that can arise from influenza and its other complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come the autumn, when are flu vaccine is offered to health care workers, I hope to be at the front of the queue. I just hope that in the interim I can avoid catching swine flu from one of my patients, since I cannot predict whether I will be one of the 800 or so in whom the infection might trigger GBS, and I cannot predict if I will be one of the many thousands who will die from complications of influenza. Or perhaps for Halvorsen’s benefit I should rephrase that to read: &lt;i&gt;“I cannot predict if I will be one of the many thousands who will die of a bad cold.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At 14 and having just failed Grade 8, Norton was finally assessed as dyslexic. He's 29 now and, by anyone's measure, a success in life, working for Grouse Mountain ski patrol, organizing summer camps for kids with self-esteem issues, facilitating youth workshops and organizing workshops at a recovery centre.

But the slender, athletic North Shore resident still has trouble filling out forms, writing and reading. "To pick up a book and really enjoy reading it, that's what I'd love to be able to do," he says.

He believes he doesn't read well not only because of dyslexia, but also from low self-esteem and lack of confidence resulting from a stressful school experience. Although his reading skills were extremely poor, Norton was always passed through to the next grade--even at a private school specializing in dyslexia. He was 21 when he picked up his first book.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249692299979"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentl.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc10d0330e89bf9d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Alain de Botton: A kinder, gentler philosophy of success</title><published>2009-08-08T00:44:51Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T00:44:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/TGyWTPNa0T4/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentl.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentl.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/TGyWTPNa0T4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249692299979"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/michele_bachmann_faces_the_pre.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa2ab0a90a65aed3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Michele Bachmann"/><title type="html">Michele Bachmann faces the press on the Census Conspiracy Theory</title><published>2009-08-08T00:26:48Z</published><updated>2009-08-08T00:26:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/xBCGoeDqnj0/michele_bachmann_faces_the_pre.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/michele_bachmann_faces_the_pre.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3qJqyCIPoeE%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why and of whom am I envious? I'll tell you. Phil Plait, a.k.a. The Bad Astronomer, attracts a more famous class of antivaccine loon. He's managed to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/07/the-avn-is-reaping-what-they-sowed/#comment-204596"&gt;attract Dr. Joe Mercola himself in the comments of a post about anti-vaccine zealots&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you TRULY are interested in finding out the truth about this topic you are encouraged to attend the Fourth International Public Conference on Vaccines in Washington DC in October.

&lt;p&gt;The top experts in the world on this topic will be presenting and you can really understand the science rather than criticize individuals out of your ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No thanks, Dr. Joe. I have better things to do with my time and money. I will, however, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dr_bob_sears_stealth_anti-vaccinationist.php"&gt;refer you to my analysis of your impending little quackfest&lt;/a&gt;.

I'll also refer Dr. Mercola &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=36"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some of the science about vaccines and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/medicine/antivaccination_lunacy/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a combination of snark and science.&lt;/p&gt;

I like the rogue nature of the pseudonymous blogosphere where you're left to determine someone's credibility based on the validity of what they write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, when I read PalMD's first post discussing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/bmi_tmi.php"&gt;his recent issues with his weight and his first day's diet&lt;/a&gt;, I emailed him immediately and appealed like you have never seen a woman appeal before.  You see, Pal said something in his post that struck a bit of a nerve with everyone's favorite domestic and laboratory goddess:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt; Evidence shows that any diet that restricts calories, independent of content, will make you lose weight, so that's what I'm doing. I tell my patients that if they don't feel miserably hungry, they're probably doing something wrong---so far, I'm doing it right.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I value the expertise of my MD colleagues very much.  That said, it is my general experience that physicians are not well-trained to counsel patients in weight loss and exercise and I was worried by Pal&amp;#39;s advice -- that he needed to feel miserably hungry in order to know he was successful. Pal&amp;#39;s right that caloric restriction is necessary to sustain weight loss, but I believe his statement that one need be miserably hungry to be directly contrary to current evidence.  I also believe it is one of the primary reasons that patients fail at losing weight effectively and sustaining weight loss.  In the choice between feeling miserable and being fat, many patients choose to remain overweight.  Feeling hungry is a very powerful sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realized, however, as I appealed to Pal about his diet with the nature of my degrees and my clinical affiliations that I had a much larger (pardon the pun) ability appeal to authority that, perhaps it is time to discuss:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/08/palmds_bmi_tmi/Fat%20and%20Thin%20Isis.jpg" alt="Fat and Thin Isis.jpg" height="416" width="500"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: On the left, Isis at 240 pounds.  On the right, Isis at 155 pounds.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I can tell you off the bat that based on my own experience, but more importantly based on the scientific evidence available, I think that Pal&amp;#39;s diet is lacking nutritionally in a couple of places and that the idea that he need be hungry potentially dooms him to failure.  Over the next several posts I hope to talk more about my specific concerns and also present some key studies from the literature. I&amp;#39;ll present to you recommendations from sources like the &lt;a href="http://www.americanheart.org/"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.acsm.org/"&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; to help you make your own informed decisions.  &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/neurotopia"&gt;Scicurious&lt;/a&gt; has logged her graduate student diet over the last few days for me and we can also discuss that.  There&amp;#39;s some real shenanigans in that little muffin&amp;#39;s diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most importantly, I hope we can all lend Pal a supportive word because weight loss is not easy.  As I am intimately familiar with, weight loss with a young child and spouse and a demanding schedule is especially not easy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, go over to &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground"&gt;White Coat Underground&lt;/a&gt; and wish him well.&lt;br&gt;

Someone walks into a crowded restaurant, looks about the diners calmly, and blows themselves up as well as everyone nearby.  Why?  This is a scenario that forces us to explain the dark side of human nature.  Why do humans have a capacity for such hate that they'll take their own lives in order to destroy others?

A study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on chimpanzee behavior suggests that humans may be alone in this way: a dubious distinction to say the least.  In a review published in the Chicago Tribune the researchers suggest:

"Spitefulness may be a peculiarly human trait," said Keith Jensen, a Canadian evolutionary biologist who has been looking to see whether human concepts like fairness and punishment are present in the social organization of another highly socialized species.

Joseph Hoffmann&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurtz wrote an article on “The Future of Secular Humanism in America” in the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;Free Inquiry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While discussing the three decades since the Council for Secular Humanism was founded, &lt;a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;amp;page=kurtz_29_5"&gt;he is still publicly upset over his ousting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I recount the history of our movement because our publications constantly bring in new readers, many of whom may not know what an uphill battle it has been to build these institutions. But more pointedly, today we have reached a critical new junction; for I have been replaced as chairman of the Council for Secular Humanism, CSI, and the Center for Inquiry, a position that I held since our founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have found — much to my dismay, even at the Center for Inquiry — is that competitive battles for self-aggrandizement and personal advantage are inescapable. These tendencies, I hasten to add, exist in the broader consumer-capitalist-corporate culture in which we live, where egoistic self-interest is the norm rather than the quest for the common good or the recognition of our empathetic responsibilities to others. I recognize that all social institutions experience power plays and that not only corporations but churches and temples are affected by the competitive rat race. Hence, the frontier for the Center for Inquiry movement as I view it is whether secular humanism can achieve a new level of moral excellence. As I move on from my former role as founder and chairman of the Center for Inquiry movement, I stand on the sidelines hoping that my creation is able to mature in wisdom and develop a new eupraxsophy of quality. We must move beyond the battle with the Religious Right, important as that has been. We need a new agenda if we are to survive, and that is the development of a new morality as part of the emerging planetary community of humankind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a fondness for Kurtz, as &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/02/a-living-obituary-of-paul-kurtz/"&gt;I wrote about here&lt;/a&gt;.  But the more his frustration gets aired publicly, the more damage it does to the product he loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, as he writes this, Kurtz says “What is important about secular humanism today is its &lt;em&gt;positive outlook&lt;/em&gt;.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to focus on that, though.  Instead of discussing the future of Secular Humanism in America, the whole article seems geared toward rehashing the immediate past.&lt;br&gt;

See &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/blog/57"&gt;more by DeeTee here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the swine flu pandemic tightens its global grip, antivaccinationists far and wide are gearing up for their propaganda war against the H1N1 vaccine. Their objections, predictably enough, conform to the usual diet of antivaccine canards that they always employ to frighten people about vaccines, but the novelty of the current pandemic offers them unlimited scope for scaremongering among the millions of worried potential vaccine recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any valid reasons to have concerns over this flu vaccine? Well, possibly, but not to the extent the antivaccination lobby would have us believe. There are still issues that need to be resolved, some of which are strategic rather than scientific in nature such as whether the vaccine should be mandatory or not. Regarding the science it is as yet unclear exactly how protective the vaccine will be, and studies are under way to determine the correct balance between HA antigen dose and immunogenicity, which will influence both the incidence rate of reactions and also determine how effective it will be in the groups most in need of it. It may be that two doses are required for optimum protectiveness, and studies to look at this are under way. The technology used to produce vaccine is not new; essentially all that is being done is to tweak the antigenic components of the seasonal vaccine, which has a very good safety track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the antivaccine lobby are indicating that they are deeply concerned, and they wish all of us to share their concern to the point of refusing vaccination. Now any rational person with the slightest modicum of common sense will be able to dismiss as irrelevant their usual froth about “toxic” ingredients in the vaccines, but there are some reading their diatribes against flu vaccine who might be worried, particularly when “real science” is disingenuously quoted by the antivaccine crew to support their case. One such “valid” concern is the link between influenza vaccination and an uncommon neurological disorder, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the side effects reported after flu vaccine, GBS holds sway as the most prominent in the minds (and mouths) of the antivaccinationists. A direct causal relationship has never been clearly established between flu vaccines and GBS, but the link is biologically plausible and the available epidemiological evidence points to an association. The concerns about swine flu vaccine in particular first came to light when GBS affected over 500 people following a mass influenza vaccination programme that took place in the USA in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the true facts about GBS? Firstly, it must be made clear that the most common causes of the syndrome are naturally acquired infections (although other triggers are reported). Now all infections can trigger a host immunological response, but rarely in certain individuals this host response is misdirected to cause damage to the myelin coating of nerve cells, causing GBS. This process of demyelination results in weakness and paralysis, which can take months to resolve, and it can rarely be fatal (although much less so nowadays with the advent of treatments such as plasmapharesis and immunoglobulin infusions). There are a number of infections known to trigger GBS, &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; gastroenteritis being the best-known example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines, containing as they do microbiologically active agents, might reasonably be assumed to pose some risk since their action mimics that of the natural infections, hence the concerns about vaccine-induced GBS. This immune-mediated process might operate either through molecular mimicry, or through “bystander activation”, but clear evidence that these actually occur with flu vaccines is weak and inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976 there was an &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no01/05-0965.htm"&gt;outbreak of influenza&lt;/a&gt; among US servicemen stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey that resulted in several hundred clinical cases and one death. The strain identified was a novel Hsw1N1 “swine flu” virus, similar to the 1918 pandemic Spanish flu strain which killed half a million people. Fear that another 1918-type pandemic was about to occur prompted the authorities to begin mass vaccination and a total of 45 million Americans were vaccinated against swine flu. In fact there never was a significant outbreak, not because the population was protected by vaccine, but because transmission of the virus remained confined to Fort Dix by the infection control measures implemented at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the vaccination campaign, there was a rise in the numbers of GBS recorded that year, with 581 cases being reported by the CDC in Atlanta. This led to speculation that the vaccinations were responsible, but the number of reported cases was disputed since there was felt to be some bias in the collation of data and the criteria for diagnosing GBS. Subsequent reanalysis conducted by the CDC’s Immunisation Safety Branch rejected 29% of the reported cases of GBS. One of the possible theories as to why the vaccine might have caused GBS was that the vaccine had been contaminated with Campylobacter jejuni, since at that time this infection was common in poultry and the vaccine was produced in chick embryos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, there has been concern that influenza vaccines given for seasonal flu might cause the same problem, particularly when in the USA in 1994 when the numbers of cases of GBS rose to 74, having been only 37 the year before. These reports prompted The Institute of Medicine to set up a &lt;a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/15625.aspx"&gt;Safety Review Committee&lt;/a&gt; to study the links between influenza vaccines and neurological syndromes. The IOM reviewed all available evidence regarding GBS post vaccination, for which there were many detailed analyses available. In 2003 they reported &lt;i&gt;“the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship between the 1976 Swine Influenza vaccine and GBS in adults.”&lt;/i&gt; However, the evidence for other years was &lt;i&gt;“inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship”&lt;/i&gt;. The estimated risk of GBS after flu vaccine is currently thought to be around 1 to 2 cases per million vaccinated persons per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An association between influenza season and a rise in the incidence of GBS &lt;a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Influenza,+Campylobacter+and+Mycoplasma+infections,+and+hospital...-a0156362177"&gt;has been noted before&lt;/a&gt;, with the suggestion that influenza infection itself might be a cause. However, it is often difficult to dissociate what might be due to influenza infection from what might be due to influenza vaccination – obviously both are common during flu season. As the authors of the study commented: &lt;i&gt;“Whether the associations [of GBS] with influenza are real or whether they reflect seasonal patterns in influenza vaccination is unclear.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of influenza was clarified in a &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/594124"&gt;recent French study&lt;/a&gt; published as a major article in the in-house journal of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. This not only looked at epidemiological data on GBS but also tested all the cases microbiologically to establish the causative agent. In 18% of GBS cases they investigated, influenza infection was shown to be the cause. They also estimated that the incidence of influenza-related GBS to be 4-7 cases for every 100,000 cases of influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this evidence leave the antivaccine lobby’s claims about GBS and swine flu vaccine? Essentially nowhere. That GBS might be triggered by flu vaccine is possible; it certainly seems as though 33 years ago it may have done so with the vaccine produced at that time. Whether the current swine flu vaccine will do anything similar is questionable; flu vaccines produced since 1976 do not appear to have significantly raised the risks of GBS above the background noise level, and any epidemiological rise in GBS cases during the flu season may not be due to the vaccine but actually caused by influenza. In fact the most powerful argument in favour of continuing to have flu vaccine (thereby running a tiny, one or two in a million risk of GBS) is that flu itself is a relatively common cause of GBS, and would appear to cause it once in every 14,000 to 25,000 episodes of flu. Running the risks of a rare vaccine side effect is perfectly acceptable when the risks from not having the vaccine are much worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict that the supposed risk of GBS will be one of the more specious reasons bandied about by the antivaccine lobby in the coming months as a reason why we should avoid the flu vaccine. And it’s not just the rabid antivaccine websites promoting this view, there have already been articles in the “quality” UK papers questioning the value of vaccination, as exemplified by &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6722428.ece"&gt;this one in the Times&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Halvorsen, a prominent antivaccine proponent with his own new antivaccine book to promote (and profit from). He claims: &lt;i&gt;“The case for vaccinating millions of healthy adults against a disease that is no more unpleasant than a bad cold is questionable”&lt;/i&gt;.   This completely ignores the evidence that for certain susceptible groups, influenza infection may be extremely serious. Now I have looked after many patients who have died from influenza, but never anyone who died of “a bad cold”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halvorsen goes on to say this about widespread vaccination: &lt;i&gt;“We could expect hundreds of people to get GBS, some of whom will suffer permanent paralysis or die.”&lt;/i&gt;  If as many as 30% of the UK population receive the vaccine, and if the rates of GBS compare with those experienced after the USA 1976 flu vaccine programme (which is unlikely as there is no reason to anticipate the same rate of reactions now as there were in 1976), there might be between 166 and 200 cases attributable to vaccine (based upon the described risk of one case in 100,000-120,000 vaccinated persons). But if the rate of vaccine-associated GBS conforms to that thought to occur with more current flu vaccines (1-2 per million), we could expect only between 20 and 40 cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, any estimates of vaccine-associated GBS cases must be set against the risks of flu-associated GBS. If as many as 30% of the UK population get swine flu this autumn (as is widely predicted), we might anticipate around 800 cases of flu-induced GBS. One might reasonably conclude that, given all the available scientific evidence, having flu vaccine is actually a very logical and effective way to prevent GBS in a pandemic flu scenario. But I don’t expect antivaccine proponents like Halvorsen to appreciate this fact, since they only ever look at risks from the vaccine and never the risks from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind this antivaccine propaganda is entirely spurious, and like all of the other risks we are so solicitously warned about, the fears are manifestly unjustified. Of course vaccines can and will cause reactions; after all they are biologically active products. But the potential benefits of the influenza vaccine, particularly for those in higher risk groups, far outweigh the potential harm from reactions. The risks of problems such as vaccine-associated GBS are significantly less than the risk of influenza-induced GBS, and are miniscule compared to the serious risks that can arise from influenza and its other complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come the autumn, when are flu vaccine is offered to health care workers, I hope to be at the front of the queue. I just hope that in the interim I can avoid catching swine flu from one of my patients, since I cannot predict whether I will be one of the 800 or so in whom the infection might trigger GBS, and I cannot predict if I will be one of the many thousands who will die from complications of influenza. Or perhaps for Halvorsen’s benefit I should rephrase that to read: &lt;i&gt;“I cannot predict if I will be one of the many thousands who will die of a bad cold.”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

That premise, though, is really just an excuse for some truly gorgeous and shimmeringly imaginative artwork.

Sounds like a slam dunk, right? Let's go back in time to the first century and see the three undeniable facts the Ephesians all accepted, okay? ;-) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a riot in Ephesus when Paul was in town and the people shouted him down, claiming their god Artemis was Great. Then we read:&lt;blockquote&gt;The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: "Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acts 19:35-37&lt;/blockquote&gt;The three facts he spoke of were: 1)The city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis; 2) and of her image, 3) which fell from heaven. The clerk said "these facts are undeniable."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess it's because Dr. Craig lives in a Christian culture with Biblical scholars who accept these so-called facts he can make this argument in the first place. After all, who can dispute the facts, right? Facts are facts!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-426976929564927252?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to ask you what you can tell me about rocks.  I think you learned a little about rocks in school, didn't you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/strong&gt; No?  Did you learn something about different kinds of rocks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Free-Ride:&lt;/strong&gt; No?  Am I thinking about your sibling?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Younger offspring:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/friday_sprog_blogging_rocks_an.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/friday_sprog_blogging_rocks_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/-A_XevMW6xk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249675156906"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4353">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b47b068b2eb1cf3b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="dembski" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Dembski"/><category term="intelligentdesign" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="intelligent design"/><title type="html">Barrett Brown whacks Dembski on HuffPo</title><published>2009-08-07T19:34:19Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T19:34:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/08/barrett-brown-w.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Huffington Post has some execrably bad aspects (its embrace of woo in health, for example), it does have the occasional gem.

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, though, that some of the comments are remarkably dumb.  Second law of thermodynamics?  Gads.  And ‘That’s not evolution, it’s just adaptation.’  (Though they get a little lighter late in the thread – is there golfing in heaven?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been consumed with frustration in recent days. The principal cause of this has been industrial action by an assortment of trolls who think that holding strikes for pay in a recession, thus holding commuters to ransom, is a good way to improve public relations. ... We commuters are so powerless...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the APA has decided that changing sexual orientation is impossible.  That is quite a shift in policy form the days when the information about homosexuality in the psychology literature was all about "abberent" behavior or "perversion" and Teh Gay was confined, in textbooks, to the "Abmormal Psychology" volume.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Global warming is beginning to drive evolution of plants and animals. And soon it will be shifting to high gear. &lt;a href="http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2178"&gt;Read more &lt;/a&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Yale Environment 360&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You, me, and the mushroom over there are all eukaryotes. So are slime molds and &lt;em&gt;Giardia&lt;/em&gt;. We all share a number of features that set us apart from prokaryotes like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The split between eukaryotes and other living things is arguably the deepest in all life. In this week’s issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, I have an essay that looks at how the basic eukaryote cell, complete with nucleus, mitochondria, and all its other bells and whistles came to be. Check it out (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/325/5941/666"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://carlzimmer.com/articles/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1249671744&amp;amp;archive=&amp;amp;start_from=&amp;amp;ucat=12&amp;amp;"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). And you can also listen to me talk about the question on this week’s &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; podcast &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5941/666/DC1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249673121286"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1644">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6d0fae4110e65a23</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Usage advice"/><category term="Variation"/><title type="html">Unspecified large number</title><published>2009-08-07T19:05:20Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T19:05:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1644" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some corrections to and clarifications of my &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1634"&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;by the hundreds&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;by hundreds&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;by the hundred&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an apology for having posted about Burchfield's note on &lt;em&gt;by the hundreds&lt;/em&gt; (which declares it to be "unidiomatic") without going back and checking the original Fowler and Gowers's edition of Fowler; instead Tim Moon and I just looked at our project files about Fowler and Gowers, and these files were (for some reason) missing coverage of the expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know that the trail goes back to Fowler and that the "unidiomatic" label reflects Fowler's taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, an apology for rushing to post and not adding all the qualifications about searches for the three expressions at issue. Just searching for &lt;em&gt;by the hundreds&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;by hundreds&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;by the hundred&lt;/em&gt;, looking for uses conveying 'in large number(s)', pulls up a fair amount of irrelevant material: instances of &lt;em&gt;by the hundred&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#39;in lots of 100′, examples like &amp;quot;noticed by hundreds of researchers&amp;quot;, and so on. In my earlier posting I narrowed the search by adding the verb &lt;em&gt;came&lt;/em&gt;, and found all three variants to be attested, but with different frequencies (with &lt;em&gt;the hundreds&lt;/em&gt; well in front). I find all three variants acceptable, but prefer &lt;em&gt;the hundreds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenters tried a variety of searches (and expanded the scope to include &lt;em&gt;score&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dozen&lt;/em&gt;, which don't seem to work quite the same way as &lt;em&gt;hundred&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;thousand&lt;/em&gt;). Mark Liberman noted that hits for &lt;em&gt;the hundreds&lt;/em&gt; in books seem to be &amp;quot;mainly recent and/or American&amp;quot; — mainly but by no means exclusively. All three variants are attested for some time back and in British as well as American sources, but it&amp;#39;s reasonable to speculate that Fowler&amp;#39;s taste reflected British preferences of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final remark about a misunderstanding that crops up repeatedly in comments on Language Log postings about variation. When I expressed a personal preference for the variant &lt;em&gt;the hundreds&lt;/em&gt;, some readers seem to have taken me to be disparaging the other variants, and responded by saying they found one of the other variants (in particular, &lt;em&gt;the hundred&lt;/em&gt;) unexceptionable. But I never dissed the other variants, and indeed said quite clearly that I found all three variants acceptable. Different people have different preferences, and many people will use two or all three of the variants on different occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current guess at what's going on in these responses is that some people are implicitly subscribing to some version of the One Right Way principle, so that if one variant is allowed, other variants are disfavored, or even disallowed. But no scholar of variation or usage holds to such a principle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249671673943"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8702">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d12a2b79e900862f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Geeks vs Nerds</title><published>2009-08-07T19:00:26Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T19:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8702" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=24d25fbfe6afa77eacacbae93dec3b29&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a geek. I am obsessed with sci-fi. I own and watch anime. I wear “clever” t-shirts that need to be explained to some people. I have a list of things I would dress as at a con (and some of the pieces for each). I have owned and displayed action figures and comic books. I have been known to incessantly make pop-culture references regardless of whether or not the people I’m talking to will get it. I take personal offense when horrible movies are made in conjunction with amazing classics – &lt;strong&gt;I’m looking at you, Star Wars I, II &amp;amp; III&lt;/strong&gt;. As soon as I finish watching the series finale of a show (i.e. Firefly, BSG, etc)&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I make plans to rewatch the series in its entirety &lt;em&gt;[aside: BSG is on the border. I loved the series as a whole, but still hold a grudge over the series finale.]&lt;/em&gt;. I play video games and rarely get outside during daylight because of my internet addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I’m not a nerd. Make a more-than-entry-level science reference and I need to look it up. I never took higher than Algebra II. I don’t know how to program, code or even set the instant brewer on the coffee pot. I am not pursuing a career based in science (although honestly Accounting is rather nerdy in its own right). I appreciate science and love to learn about it, but I don’t understand most of it at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own definition of nerd, geek, dork, etc… What I’ve itemized above is simply my own interpretation of two of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you define yourself based on social stigmas? Are you a nerd? A geek? A dork? A poindexter? None of the above? What are your interpretations of each of them?

You can probably hear it on your local NPR station - if not, you can find all the shows recorded on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may remember that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/back_from_boston.php" title=""&gt;went to Boston&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, as a part of a team of people helping the show do something special: use the NSF grant they recently received to expand their science coverage and, in collaboration with &lt;a href="http://www.sigmaxi.org/" title=""&gt;Sigma Xi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/" title=""&gt;NOVA&lt;/a&gt;, tie their radio science coverage to their online offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/" title=""&gt;The World: Science website&lt;/a&gt;, a series of weekly science podcasts with &lt;a href="http://www.elsakristen.com/" title=""&gt;Elsa Youngsteadt&lt;/a&gt; and David Kohn (&lt;a href="http://www.theworld.org/rss/science.xml" title=""&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to the RSS feed) and, starting this week, something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the radio show will have a brief segment on a science topic that includes an interview with a science-related person. A longer version of that story/interview will be on the website as a podcast, with additional links to outside sources. And, most exciting, the person who was interviewed for the show will come by the &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/forum/" title=""&gt;online forum&lt;/a&gt; for a week after the show and answer readers/listeners' questions. Like an online version of a Science Cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the guest will be entomologist &lt;a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/entomology/faculty/berenbaum.html" title=""&gt;May Berenbaum&lt;/a&gt;. In the podcast and in the forum she will address the DDT debate: Is it really as bad as the critics say?  (Even Rachel Carson thought it had value.)  Is it really as good as the proponents say?  (Sure, it may help with malaria control for a while, but eventually the mosquitoes will develop resistance.)  Here's an op/ed May had in the Washington Post a few years ago: &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/04/AR2005060400130.html" title=""&gt;If Malaria's the Problem, DDT's Not the Only Answer&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, listen to the &lt;a href="http://www.world-science.org/forum/%20ddt-malaria-may-berenbaum/" title=""&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; and join the conversation which has already started and will be ongoing until next Friday. We hope that, with all of you checking in and spreading the word, the discussion will grow.&lt;/p&gt;

Needless to say, people are baffled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily, there is a &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/assets/pdf/media/radio/effective_evangelism.pdf"&gt;PDF of the entire book&lt;/a&gt; available online.  The somewhat awkward premise is that when Paul was preaching to the Jews, he had an easier time than when he was preaching to the Greeks, because (according to Ham) the Greeks were evolutionists while the Jews were Creationists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think it's quite a stretch to say that "the Greeks were evolutionists", though certainly their creation myths were quite dissimilar to the Jews and the Christians, while of course those groups shared the same Judeo-Christian Creation myth (go figure, eh?).  This seems like a subtle difference, but it's actually an important point, as we will see below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ham wants to extend this premise to assert that undermining evolution is the first step in making people receptive to Christian evangelism.  But wait!  As I pointed out above, the difference he &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; pointed out between the Greeks and the Jews is that the Jews share a shitload of scripture with the Christians, while the Greeks didn't.  In fact, last time I checked, the Creation story comprises less than 0.14% of the words in the Old Testament (sources: &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1"&gt;Genesis chapter 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question3824.html"&gt;Bible word count&lt;/a&gt;)  So why does Ham zero in on the Creation story as the only important similarity between Judaism and Christianity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh wait, I remember... because he's got a fucking museum that makes money off of bashing evolution.  That's right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I have to say, I find this picture kind of offensive:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SnxrTOktA7I/AAAAAAAAAEQ/LPrDZ6N1nYI/s1600-h/gospeltripsjews.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:226px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Uyocm6NTzc4/SnxrTOktA7I/AAAAAAAAAEQ/LPrDZ6N1nYI/s320/gospeltripsjews.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blech.

It seems like barely a decade ago that Limp Bizkit exhorted hippies to “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywuYC0n5cNg"&gt;Break Stuff&lt;/a&gt;,” the Chili Peppers encouraged their fans to set things on “&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8408nyWreEE"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;,” and Kid Rock convinced the audience that they should “Turn on, tune in, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6nvrYopHV8"&gt;Bawitdaba&lt;/a&gt; out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/6563302.html"&gt;historians argue&lt;/a&gt;, it &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; been forty years, making it just the right time to reconsider Woodstock as a “spiritual” experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Spirituality may not be the first thing people associate with Woodstock,” says Fornatale, who recently talked about his book at the Museum at Bethel Woods, situated on the site of the festival. “But young people were searching for an identity and for a meaning that they found there that weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fornatale sees the festival as a massive communion ceremony featuring hymns like Amazing Grace and Swing Low, Sweet Chariot performed by Arlo Guthrie and Joan Baez, sermons by musical prophets the likes of Sylvester Stewart of Sly and the Family Stone, and a modern-day re-enactment of Jesus’ miracle of the loaves and fishes exhibited in the communal ethos of festival goers who shared food with hungry “brothers and sisters.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memories of the event revolve more around $4 bottles of water and $12 mini-pizzas, which I certainly don’t remember transsubstantiating into the blood and flesh of Christ, although things are a little bit hazy from the &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=brown%20acid"&gt;brown acid&lt;/a&gt;, which I heard might have been bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, these historians argue, the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13631806@N00/154005683"&gt;aesthetic permissiveness&lt;/a&gt; of the festival helped lay the groundwork for a new generation of “cool Christian” preachers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now the unbuttoned look is the norm for megachurch pastors such as Rick Warren. “No one questions that a burly fellow who stands up front with a beard and a Hawaiian shirt can speak prophetically about the Gospel message,” said Oppenheimer. “That’s not something that would have happened in the 1950s or 1960s.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in addition to all the other things that filthy hippies deserve blame for, we need to add Rick Warren.  Thanks, jerks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249669836904"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/07/galaxy-smash/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/83ba04beda3a8fa0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Galaxy SMASH!</title><published>2009-08-07T18:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T18:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/07/galaxy-smash/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
30 years ago, astronomers started playing around with making simulations of colliding galaxies. Computers were slow, so they could only keep track of a few hundred or thousand stars, which limited the models severely. The software had to keep track of every star, its location, velocity, and mass… the number of calculations is forbidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have come a long way. Now astronomers can track millions of stars using hydrodynamics codes, and then graphically display them giving them color, adding in dust, the effects of cloud collisions, supernovae… and the results are stunning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agqLEbOFT2A"&gt;Have a look&lt;/a&gt;. This is not just some animation; this is an actual result using complicated math and physics. It’s also lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

The interpretation of timing — not within but between communications — hasn&amp;#39;t been studied much. There&amp;#39;s Wally Chafe&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HwwzsyMNiJMC"&gt;Discourse, Consciousness, Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but I don't recall much in it about interpreting the length of gaps or silences. There's some of &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m841041176x63141/"&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt; in work on computer-mediated conversation. And there's some work on intercultural differences in conversational "dead air", which I'll try to find. But it's a topic that might repay further investigation, I think, in a culture where more and more interaction is asynchronous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update — The work I was thinking of, on communicative norms in certain North American Indian cultures, is summarized by John Gumperz (&amp;quot;Contextualization and Ideology in Intercultural Communication&amp;quot;, in DiLuzio, Günthner and Orletti (Eds.), &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fGuAiaGY6tcC"&gt;Culture in Communication&lt;/a&gt;) this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Conversations are often punctuated with relatively long pauses and silences. In informal gatherings, Indian people may sit or stand quietly, without speaking. If addressed, they may look away and remain silent for a relatively long time (at least from the perspective of mainstream Americans) before responding. When a person is asked a question and she has no new information to provide, nothing new to say, she is likely to give no answer. In all such cases, American Indians themselves interpret the silence as a sign of respect, a positive indication, showing that the other's remarks or questions are being given full consideration that is their due.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cites work by Philips on the Warm Springs reservation in Oregon, and by Basso on Western Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Susan Philips, "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4166851"&gt;Some sources of cultural variability in the regulation of talk&lt;/a&gt;", Language in Society 5(1): 81-95, 1976:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… Indian exchanges proceed at a slower pace than those of Anglos. […] The pauses between two different speakers&amp;#39; turns at talk are frequently longer than is the case in Anglo interactions. There is a tolerance for silences — silences that Anglos often rush into and fill. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For Anglos, answers to questions are close to obligatory … That this is not the case with Warm Springs Indians was pointed out to me by an Indian from another reservation who had married into the Warm Springs reservation. He observed wryly that it is often difficult to get an answer out of &amp;#39;these old people&amp;#39; (and I should add that the phrase &amp;#39;old people&amp;#39; has the connotation of respect). And he told an anecdote about posing a question that got answered a week after it was asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In other words, answers to questions are not obligatory. Absence of an answer merely means the floor is open, or continues to belong to the questioner. This does not mean, however, that the question will not be answered later. Nor does it mean that it ought not to be raised again, since the questions may reasonably assume his audience has had time to think about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This absence of a requirement for immediate response is also apparent in the handling of invitations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Basso notes the various interpretations that failure to speak can have in mainstream American culture ("&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3629378"&gt;'To Give up on Words': Silence in Western Apache Culture&lt;/a&gt;", Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 26(3), 1970):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Although the form of silence is always the same, the function of a specific act of silence — that is, its interpretation by and effect upon other people — will vary according to the social context in which it occurs. For example, if I choose to keep silent in the chambers of a Justice of the Supreme Court, my action is likely to be interpreted as a sign of politeness or respect. On the other hand, if I refrain from speaking to an established friend or colleague, I am apt to be accused of rudeness or harboring a grudge. In one instance, my behavior is judged by others to be &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fitting&amp;quot;; in the other, it is criticized as being &amp;quot;out of line.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He goes on to list a number of situations where conversation would be nearly obligatory in mainstream American culture, on pain of rudeness or other negative interpretation, but would be optional or even strongly discouraged among the Western Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard descriptions similar to those of Philips and Basso from several American Indianists whose experience and judgment I trust — though there is apparently (and unsurprisingly) cultural variation among different groups, as suggested by Philips&amp;#39; anecdote.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249669724466"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1645">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5e78624c3d8e8546</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Zimmer subs for Safire</title><published>2009-08-07T18:08:59Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T18:08:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1645" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;After his &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1620"&gt;NPR interview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1637"&gt;MSNBC honor&lt;/a&gt; for debunking the &lt;em&gt;Cronkiter&lt;/em&gt; myth, Ben Zimmer is subbing for William Safire as this week's NYT's &lt;em&gt;On Language&lt;/em&gt; columnist: "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/magazine/09FOB-onlanguage-t.html"&gt;How Fail Went From Verb to Interjection&lt;/a&gt;", 8/7/2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Time was, &lt;em&gt;fail &lt;/em&gt;was simply a verb that denoted being unsuccessful or falling short of expectations. It made occasional forays into nounhood, in fixed expressions like &lt;em&gt;without fail&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;no-fail&lt;/em&gt;. That all started to change in certain online subcultures about six years ago. In July 2003, a contributor to Urbandictionary.com noted that &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt; could be used as an interjection “when one disapproves of something,” giving the example: “You actually bought that? FAIL.” This punchy stand-alone fail most likely originated as a shortened form of “You fail” or, more fully, “You fail it,” the taunting “game over” message in the late-’90s Japanese video game Blazing Star, notorious for its fractured English.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In a few years’ time, the use of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as an interjection caught on to such an extent that particularly egregious objects of ridicule required an even stronger barb: &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;major fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; überfail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;span&gt; massive fail&lt;/span&gt; or, most popular of all, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;epic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The intensifying adjectives hinted that &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was becoming a new kind of noun: not simply a synonym for &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but, rather, a derisive label to slap on a miscue that is eminently mockable in its stupidity or wrongheadedness. Online cynics deploy &lt;span&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt; as a countable noun (“That’s such a &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt;!”) and also as a mass noun that treats failure as an abstract quality: the offending party is often said to be &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;full of fail&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;or &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;made of fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m blaming my current oral surgery-related pain killer high for my inability to artfully construct sentences and/or be clever, so let’s get straight to the prize. This week’s COTW goes to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8694&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-72654"&gt;Chasmosaur for responding to news that the NY Times expelled Ben Steinn&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hacked into the Times’ servers, and found this draft of Catherin Mathis’ statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Quite honestly, we have been uncomfortable with lending him journalistic and cultural credibility since the release of &lt;strong&gt;“Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed”&lt;/strong&gt;. However, we could find no grounds to dismiss him because of the film, and such an act would have opened us up to dangerous criticism on denying him First Amendment rights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Now, though, we didn’t feel we could ignore that Mr. Stein so obligingly accommodated us with a legitimate, undeniable reason to remove him from our roster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;One might say that he intelligently designed the situation so we could firmly hold the moral high ground in releasing him from our service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilariously spot-on.&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Richard,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am fairly open about my atheism around my friends and my apparently deist father, much of the older generation is devoutly Catholic. My grandparents know that I do not need church to be a good person, and have left the issue alone, but my great-aunt pressures me to come back to the church every time she sees me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am probably the most vocally philosophical in my family, and my grandmother and I share a fascination with science and history, so there is never a lack of interesting discussion when I visit, but it has gotten to the point with my aunt… that I feel uncomfortable around her. She recently grabbed me at a family party and pleaded with me to come back to the church, and all I could manage to stammer out was “I don’t go to church anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also sends me Catholic pamphlets and religious cards whenever she remembers;  basically all the junk mail she gets from the various charities she has donated over her many years gets forwarded to the godless nieces and  nephews.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question is: what can I do if she corners me again, or if other relatives do? I feel uncomfortable because I love my family dearly, but I don’t want to be harassed about my godless ways. I know they’ll never hate me, they’re all wonderful people, but the pity is unbearable, and I can’t stand to see my poor old aunt spending time worrying about me. She is a wonderful person and I adore her, but I don’t want to feel afraid to talk to her.  What do I do?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornered, Rhode Island
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Cornered,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like almost every family has its “crazy uncle” or “crazy aunt.” They’re just part of the familial landscape. Sometimes it’s not about religion, but some other thing about which they are too, too passionate for the comfort of other family members. We love them, but we can’t take very much when they go into “that thing.”  How “crazy” your great aunt is (and I mean this figuratively more than psychologically) will determine the best way to handle this, and I can’t be certain from your letter.  Let’s simplify it to three possible levels, with some suggested responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The most likely case is she’s not crazy in any real sense,  but simply enthusiastic about church. If this is the case, then even if you felt flustered and awkward, your reply of “I don’t go to church anymore,” was exactly the right response. It was honest and to the point, needing no addition of inflammatory details like “I’m an atheist.”  One strategy would be to simply repeat that response verbatim, exactly the same, every time she tries to churchify you. Say it with an adult-to-adult tone that is loving but  final, that tells her you are now done on that subject.  Then immediately start talking about some other subject that she is interested in, something you have thought of ahead of time, just in case.  It should be something about her, rather than you.  Ask about her gardening, her hobby, her pet, her travels, an interesting part of her past, any non-church topic. Think about how she is a wonderful person whom you adore, and that will warm your speech as you show your interest in her. Results may not be immediate, but hopefully in time she will stop the behavior that you are not rewarding, and she will increase the behavior that you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Perhaps her religiosity is at a level where she will have some difficulty responding appropriately to your polite request to leave you alone on the subject. In this case, you may have to be more directive, and play a more parental role.  Take her aside, where the two of you can talk privately.  Tell her that you think she is a wonderful person and that you adore her.  Tell her warmly and firmly that church is just not for you, and that even though you know that it is not her intention, her repeated efforts are hurting your feelings because she is not taking you seriously or respecting you.  Tell her that she can have the faith that God knows better than her what is best for you, so she can leave your spiritual needs up to him.  Listen briefly to her response, but if she starts it all up again, tell her that she is again hurting your feelings, and that you will not talk with her if she continues.  Then as in #1 above, immediately change the subject to something pleasant about her.   Another tack would be to enlist the help of your science-loving grandmother.  She is on the same generational level as your great aunt, and may have some credibility and influence with her. A gentle suggestion from her to not worry about your religious practice might be enough.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The least likely case is that she is seriously disturbed and obsessed, where she has a tangle of irrational fears and hopes that are more about her own insecurities than her concern about you.  If so, you will need the assistance of other family members, allies like your grandmother and your father.  There may not be much hope for improving her behavior.  Your alliances with others would be  more about devising strategies for minimizing the most annoying interactions with her.  It is a sad reality that disorders which include problematic religiosity often tend to be chronic.  But I don’t think it is likely that she’s at this level, because if she were, you’d probably not describe her as a wonderful person whom you adore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You mentioned the possibility of other relatives doing similar things. If they make religious overtures to you individually, respond to them individually. Avoid reacting to them all at once as a group, or you might inadvertently create an alliance between them against your “godless ways” that wasn’t there before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornered, lastly and most importantly, reduce your own discomfort, your own hypersensitivity.  Look into your own thoughts and feelings, and disabuse yourself of the idea that you must take the responsibility for doing something about the thoughts and feelings that others generate solely inside their own heads.  Your great aunt may worry about you, but you can’t help that. You must be true to your own convictions, and as you continue to do so assertively, your older relatives will begin to treat you more as a full-fledged adult, more as an equal.  You do not need to be rude or cold or uncaring, but you also do not need to spend time and effort trying prevent someone else from having unhappy thoughts and feelings about you.  That is their business and their problem.  Trying to fix the crazy ideas of others can drive you crazier than them.  Enjoy this loving, intelligent and interesting family you have, including all their quirks, and you’ll learn to shrug off the stuff that will eventually not bother you at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

Steve is of some interest, so let's see who he is.  This is what Steve says this about himself in the about section of &lt;a href="http://homersontherange.com/"&gt;his own blog&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though I grew up in Garland, I was born in Irving. And my dad's biggest bragging point about me is that you could see Texas Stadium from the window in the room where I was born. So, as you can see, I never had a chance. I love the Dallas Cowboys more than most of my family members and I'm here to keep haters on the straight and narrow. I'm also the resident hippie-hater. Don't bring your liberal crap in here, because it won't be tolerated!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, Steve has been arguing with Stephanie Zvan about the crazy anti-health teabaggers over on &lt;a href="http://fabulousflatulence.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/brownshirts-intimidate-citizens-at-health-care-forums/"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;.  More recently, Stephanie wrote a post about&lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2009/08/atheism-and-alienation.html"&gt; Atheism and Alienatation. &lt;/a&gt;  In that post, Stephanie provides a very interesting and detailed discussion of what Atheists try to do, try to not do, are told to do, and told to not do. (This is not unrelated to this recent post by moi:  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/08/what_to_do_if_you_accidentally.php"&gt;What to do if you accidentally end up with a roommate who is religious?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the first comment on Stephanie's post is what &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2009/08/atheism-and-alienation.html?showComment=1249623102748#c1347738607851373947"&gt;I would count as a &lt;strong&gt;death threat.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/a&gt; It is not 100% clear that it is a threat.  It does not say "I will kill you."  It does tell Stephanie and all atheists that the sooner they die the better and that before that they don't really count as humans (to put it slightly more politely than Steve did).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is funny about this is that Steve posted that remark anonymously, and&lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2009/08/atheism-and-alienation.html?showComment=1249643895267#c8587255438285758953"&gt; Stephanie outed him&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original title for this post was "&lt;em&gt;Poe or real?  Death Threat Doling Blogger Exposed!&lt;/em&gt;" because I did not believe it was possible for anyone to be as over the top as Steve appears to be. But as I've read around and collected the info for this post, I decided that he really is what he seems to be, and as you can see, I retitled it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in that title, when I say "bad move, Steve" that is not because of something I'm going to do, like I'm going to come to Stephanie's rescue or something.  It is because  Steve has actually messed with the wrong person.  In fact, I kind of feel sorry for poor ol' Steve.  This is not to say that I wouldn't come to Stephanie's rescue.  I would.  But I know her very well and I know she'll have things totally in control.  I will simply make myself available in any way I can be helpful.  Perhaps I'll make cookies and tea for those of us who are going to enjoy watching what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, poor Steve....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, if you ever digg or stumble on or otherwise promote blog posts, this would be a good one to do, don't you think? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2009/08/atheism-and-alienation.html?showComment=1249666869837#c5519955206833072238"&gt;Apology and explanation offered and accepted. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

What would Scotty Say?</title><published>2009-08-07T15:52:50Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T15:52:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=939" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientists are &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327196.000-transparent-metal-could-be-the-stuff-of-giant-planets.html"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that yet another new state of matter has been created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time it appears to be aluminum that is transparent to intense UV radiation (soft x-rays).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are even a cadet-level star trek fan you’re probably thinking of the the movie Start Trek 4, The Voyage Home. Remember that alien probe was going to destroy the earth unless it could say hi  to an extinct whale. So to in order to bring one back from the past, Scotty used a primitive computer program that he had no familiarity with, to quickly design aluminum for a big fish tank that would be transparent  at visible wavelengths. Almost every article I read made mention of the trek connection or even had a trek picture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do they do this and is this really a new state of matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the usual suspects when it comes to matter, right?&lt;br&gt;
There’s solid, liquid and gas which are so abundant on earth they need no introduction.  The fourth state, plasma, which is what stars are made of, is the most common in the universe (excluding dark matter perhaps).  Plasmas are partially ionized gasses consisting of a certain amount of free elecrons. Look at a fluorescent bulb if you want to see some up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another state of matter is called a quark-gluon plasma.  This is some cool stuff. It existed perhaps in the early stages of the universe consisting of a soup of the building blocks of matter, quarks, and their force carrier particles, gluons. Colliders can create this exotic matter for fleeting periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:360px"&gt;&lt;img title="qgplasma" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/qgplasma.jpg" alt="Quark Gluon Plasma" width="350" height="270"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quark Gluon Plasma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final state I will discuss is my favorite. It’s called a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnqAwtorUTE"&gt;Bose-Einstein Condensate&lt;/a&gt;. If certain bits of matter are cooled to a millionth of a degree above absolute zero, a very weird thing happens. All the atoms coalesce into a superatom of sorts such that none can be distinguished from the others.  Another way to look at it is to say that all the wave-functions of the separate atoms joined to form one wave-function. When this happens, weird quantum effects become obvious at the macroscopic scale such as the Bose-Einstein Condensate spontaneously flowing up and out of a container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Back to the news item I guess. The method the scientists used to create their breed of aluminum is interesting:&lt;br&gt;
They take powerful laser called the Flash laser which is in Hamburg Germany. They then let loose with a powerful burst of soft x-ray light. There’s nothing “soft” about the power of this light though. Each burst can provide enough electricity to light an entire city (albeit for a very brief time). One article I read said it was 10 million gigawatts of power per square centimeter. That’s  10 Petawatts people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happems when matter is hit with energy like this? In this scenario, the laser energy knocks out a core electron from every atom in the sample without disrupting metal’s crystalline structure. The remaining electrrons change their configuration becoming more tightly bound preventing the x-rays from being further absorbed so they sails right through like the metal wasn’t there; hence its transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;”What we have created is a completely new state of matter nobody has seen before,” said professor Justin Wark of Oxford University’s Department of Physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This state doesn’t last long though. “As soon as you make it, the stuff blows up,”  he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does the future hold? Wark says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transparent aluminum is just the start, The physical properties of the matter we are creating are relevant to the conditions inside large planets, and we also hope that by studying it we can gain a greater understanding of what is going on during the creation of ‘miniature stars’ created by high-power laser implosions, which may one day allow the power of nuclear fusion to be harnessed here on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is this a new state of matter? I didn’t think so at first. This attitude was reflected by the following anonymous commenter I came across&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this a new state of matter? It seems this “new state”’s only property is to be transparent to UV light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little more research it became clear that the transparency is not the hallmark of this material. It’s the fact that it it’s  as dense as ordinary solid matter but is extremely hot. Whether this will ultimately be  commonly classified as a distinct form of matter is hard to predict. Classifications like this seem to be a bit  subjective to me. At some point, matter has properties that are sufficiently distinct from all other matter to warrant a designation as a “new state of matter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if scientists consider transparent aluminum to be sufficiently distinct to join that distinguished “States of Matter” list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249661451461"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0cdae5e87b767101</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">James Randi, Born Today, + 81 Years</title><published>2009-08-07T15:06:22Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T15:06:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/665-james-randi-born-today-81-years.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:3px;float:right" alt="randilibrary" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/randilibrary.jpg" height="300" width="400"&gt;Many people have expressed interest in sending James "The Amazing" Randi birthday wishes on this, the first day of his 82nd year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably readers of this blog are not a representative sample of Americans, and most or you — even the white people! — know that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea"&gt;Pangaea&lt;/a&gt; was the supercontinent that existed about 250 million years ago, before plate tectonics worked its magic and broke it apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some of my best friends are white folks, so I don’t want to make any grand generalizations about their intelligence or education.  But this is a good illustration of a point made by &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/my-review-of-unscientific-america/"&gt;Jerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt; — the problem of scientific illiteracy is not a simple one, and in particular it’s not just a matter of better outreach and more Carl Sagans.  Which is not to say that more and better outreach and science journalism isn’t important or useful — it clearly is, and I’m in favor of making structural changes to provide much better incentives for making sure that it happens.  But there are also factors at work for which outreach isn’t the answer — political and social forces that push people away from science.  Those have to be confronted if we want to really address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I don’t know who was the mischievous person who thought of asking this poll question in the first place, but it was an inspired idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/08/07/white-people-have-trouble-accepting-pangaea/#comment-90017"&gt;Aaron Golas in comments&lt;/a&gt; points to &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/7/31/760435/-Polling-Science"&gt;a post by Devilstower&lt;/a&gt; laying out that the question was worded in an intentionally provocative way, to illustrate how bad questions can fail to correctly gauge scientific understanding.  Which is completely true, and a point worth making.  But I argue that the poll does reveal something, namely the extent to which underlying cultural attitudes can influence one’s stance toward purportedly scientific questions.  Thus, “White People &lt;em&gt;Have Trouble Accepting&lt;/em&gt; Pangaea,” not “White People &lt;em&gt;Don’t Know About&lt;/em&gt; Pangaea.”  As a measure of what percentage of Americans truly understand continental drift, the poll is pretty useless; as an indication of how culture affects that understanding, it’s very illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249659144730"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5284576763626141441">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71eef356552351ec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Sound Familiar Anyone?</title><published>2009-08-07T14:01:00Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T14:14:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/of0TnzekZpQ/sound-familiar-anyone.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5284576763626141441/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5284576763626141441" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/08/sound-familiar-anyone.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">A Mormon negatively commented on the skeptical book, &lt;em&gt;Joseph Smith and the Origins of the Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;. Read on:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You know, I could probably spend a few years of my life trying to find dirt on the author of this book and likely, I would find some. The question is: why would I? It seems to me a pretty sad way to spend my life. It also seems to me that if I wanted to learn about someone, I should ask someone who loves them... if I went to someone who hates you and asked them, "what's this person like?" what kind of an answer would I get? Yes it's very easy to find dirt on someone if that's what you are looking for because the bottom line is: &lt;strong&gt;people believe what they want to believe.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to KNOW something, why not ask the only one who truly knows... God? That was Joseph Smith's message. That was the message of the Book of Mormon. It was also the message of our Savior who said: "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:" (Matt. 7:7). Or you can refer to the scripture quoted by the prophet himself: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. (I would like to continue on through the next couple of verses-) "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord." (James 1:5-7). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. Not because some person told me, and not because some man showed me a book full of evidence (there is much evidence for those who want to find it). &lt;strong&gt;I know, because like Joseph Smith, I got down on my knees, in faith, and asked my Heavenly Father if it was true.&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot know anything, but by God. What do you have to lose? &lt;strong&gt;I'm not giving you my opinions.&lt;/strong&gt; I only invite those who wish to know the truth, and who are not trying to simply reinforce their budding hatred for a man that they simply do not know. If you want to know, ask God, I promise you that He will answer if you honestly seek only the truth. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O9028RW4DASK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This Mormon claims people who don't believe don't want to believe. He's not offering his opinions. He knows because he has the inner witness of God in his heart. Does any of this sound familiar? ;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5284576763626141441?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It's not so much a literary review per se as a brief essay on Lamarck's unflattering and unwarranted legacy.  Lamarck was the first to propose a scientific theory of evolution, and he coined the terms "invertebrate" and "biology".  Unfortunately, Lamarck's important contributions are often clouded by misconceptions about what he actually said, both by critics and by modern authors who insist on (mis)labeling the inheritance of acquired characteristics as "Lamarckian", especially when discussing epigenetics research.  (For my comment on this, see &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/07/epigenetics-and-neo-neo-lamarckism.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/lamarck-didnt-say-it-darwin-did.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Thankfully, Graur et al. hit on both of these issues, and make a much-needed appeal for clarification and recognition of Lamarck's contributions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the following parts, which are particularly important:&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Lamarck has been invoked once more, again wrongly in our view, in the field of epigenetics — the study of phenotypic and gene-expression changes that occur without a change in the genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognition of Lamarck's contribution is hindered by two persistent misconceptions. First, people wrongly assume that he believed in the direct induction of advantageous hereditary changes by the environment. Yet he writes repeatedly against this notion: "For, whatever the environment may do, it does not work any direct modification whatever in the shape and organization of animals." The second misconception concerns volition. A popular caricature of Lamarckism depicts an animal, usually a giraffe, wishing to reach the upper branches of trees, and acquiring a long neck through will alone. This error may have originated from the mistranslation of the French '&lt;i&gt;besoin&lt;/i&gt;' — meaning 'need' — into the ambiguous term 'want', which can mean both 'desire' and 'need'. This poor choice by the 1914 translator was probably influenced by Cuvier's use of the word "&lt;i&gt;désir&lt;/i&gt;" in his damning eulogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;More Lamarck:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm"&gt;The imaginary Lamarck&lt;/a&gt;  by M.

As pediatrician &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;Dr. John Snyder&lt;/a&gt; relates, whenever he hears a parent say "I was reading Dr. Sears" or sees a patient in his office holding a copy of Dr. Sears' &lt;a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Vaccine Book: Making the Right Choice for Your Child&lt;/a&gt;, he knows what's coming next: Resistance to vaccination. It would be one thing if this resistance were based on evidence or science-based concerns about the safety of vaccination, but it's not. As Dr. Snyder explains, while playing the "open-minded" "tell both sides" gambit, Dr. Sears credulously regurgitates virtually every anti-vaccine canard as though it had scientific validity. At the end, he presents his very own "&lt;a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/labels/Alternative%20Vaccine%20Schedule.asp"&gt;alternative vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;," which delays various vaccines and, according to Dr. Bob, is safer than the currently recommended schedule. All the while, he urges parents not to tell their neighbors if they don't vaccinate in order not to spread their fears to others, because an increasing number of unvaccinated children will result in a decline in herd immunity and a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That spreading fear about vaccines could lead to decreases in vaccination rates, the decline of herd immunity, and the resurgence of diseases like the measles is about the only thing Dr. Bob gets right. It's also as cynical as anything J.B. Handley or Jenny McCarthy has ever said or written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing you need to know about Dr. Bob, though, it's that he desperately craves credibility among doctors. He desperately wants to be taken seriously by the medical and public health establishment. He really, really does. Unfortunately for Dr. Bob, has a funny way of showing it. Recently, despite continued oh-so-piously indignant and wounded protestations that he absolutely, positively is not anti-vaccine, Dr. Bob's actions have been strongly suggesting otherwise. The last time I dealt with Dr. Bob, he had actually written a post for that most rabid of anti-vaccine blogs, Age of Autism, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/06/dr-bob-sears-author-of-the-vaccine-book-if-a-vaccineautism-link-is-proven-will-vaccine-policy-change.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;If A Vaccine/Autism Link is Proven, Will Vaccine Policy Change?&lt;/a&gt;, which I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/dr_sears_lets_his_flag_fly.php"&gt;tore into with gusto&lt;/a&gt; because, well, Dr. Bob deserved it. I also pointed out at the time that, if you want to destroy any shred of scientific or medical credibility that you have left, writing for the anti-vaccine loons at Age of Autism is about as excellent a way of doing it as I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I learned that Dr. Bob did me one better. He thought of an even better way of destroying his scientific credibility and at the same time demolishing any claim he might have had left that he is not "anti-vaccine." No, he didn't sign on as a regular writer for AoA, although that certainly would have been one way to top his previous height of self-immolation. But he did come up with something probably as good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dr_bob_sears_stealth_anti-vaccinationist.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/dr_bob_sears_stealth_anti-vaccinationist.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/iH2NDjXiLQ0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249655940697"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/the_state_of_ethans_chest.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f66ff8141bdc377</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Lovely Sciblings"/><title type="html">The State of Ethan's Chest</title><published>2009-08-07T14:33:38Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T14:33:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/0VsHCS4c7Jc/the_state_of_ethans_chest.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/the_state_of_ethans_chest.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago the good &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;Comrade&lt;/a&gt; and I offered Ethan Siegel of &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/startswithabang"&gt;Starts With a Bang&lt;/a&gt; a combined $1000 if he would wax his chest for charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethan has made good and is now a hairless dude.  I&amp;#39;ll embed the video below the cut for my more sadistic readers.  It&amp;#39;s a funny video, although I find the use of the word &amp;quot;happy trail&amp;quot; disturbing.  I will also make good on my promise.  The revenue from my clicks will go to &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/app.php"&gt;Kiva Loans&lt;/a&gt; (Ethan&amp;#39;s designated charity) until my debt to him is paid off.  It hopefully won&amp;#39;t take very long to be &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXaZmY52gHM"&gt;back in the black&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;In other good news for Ethan, it looks as though he has been successful in &lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/app.php"&gt;soliciting &amp;gt;100 charitable commitments&lt;/a&gt; from his readers and, as he promised, will be shaving his head.  Will there be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_a_charity_ch.php#comment-1785762"&gt;any hair left on that poor man's body&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this?&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/the_state_of_ethans_chest.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/08/the_state_of_ethans_chest.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/0VsHCS4c7Jc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249655546986"><id gr:original-id="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2009/08/07/antibodies-are-ok-really/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c7c784ff0dfb568a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Antibodies are OK, really</title><published>2009-08-07T08:16:28Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T08:16:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/vjZbN0lYqAw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2009/08/07/antibodies-are-ok-really/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibody

Writing in a 1934, for example, M. Svendsen said of those children in his sample with an imaginary friend that &amp;quot;personality difficulties were present in most&amp;quot;, with &amp;quot;timidity being most common&amp;quot;.Times have changed. It depends on the precise definition of &amp;quot;imaginary friend&amp;quot;, but by some modern estimates, nearly half of all young children have an imaginary companion at some point. Moreover, children with imaginary friends have been found to be just as sociable and popular as those without an imaginary friend. Now Gabriel Trionfi and Elaine Reese have presented some preliminary evidence that having an imaginary friend could even be beneficial, tending to go hand in hand with superior narrative skills. In turn, past research has shown that superior narrative skills tend to predict later reading success and school achievement.Trionfi and Reese interviewed 48 mothers and their five-and-a-half year-old children (half of whom were girls) about whether the children had an imaginary friend now, or had had one in the past. The key finding is that the 23 children with a past or present imaginary friend performed significantly better on average at a narrative skills task. Whether re-telling a short fictional story (&amp;quot;A perfect father&amp;#39;s day&amp;quot;) to a puppet, or telling a story about a real experience they&amp;#39;d had in the last year, the children with a past or present imaginary friend tended to use more dialogue, and to provide more information about time, place and causal relations, thus providing richer stories.The researchers aren&amp;#39;t sure exactly how imaginary companions and narrative skills are linked, but one possibility is that children with an unseen companion get practice at telling stories whenever they are asked by parents or others about their invisible friend. Of course another possibility, which the design of the current study can&amp;#39;t rule out, is that having better narrative skills somehow makes it more likely that a child will develop an imaginary friend.The researchers say their evidence is too tentative and preliminary for it to be advisable to encourage children to develop an imaginary friend. &amp;quot;Rather, if a child has already created an imaginary companion, parents and teachers could allow this play to flourish.&amp;quot;_________________________________Trionfi G, &amp;amp; Reese E (2009).

In &lt;a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/20597"&gt;our last outing&lt;/a&gt; we discussed the standard cosmology, dark matter, cosmic acceleration, and a number of other issues concerning the observed matter-energy content of today’s universe. This time, we thought we’d go all early universe on you and discuss the problems of the standard cosmology, inflation, its shortcomings, and ultimately the initial conditions of the universe. Some of these topics, such as inflation, have a rather tight connection to current observations, while others are more speculative and some are touching on the philosophical, at least at this stage in our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll post a link to the new episode when it comes out tomorrow. At one stage Sean and I discuss the initial conditions for inflation, and in doing so we were led into the issues of eternal inflation, entropy and the arrow of time (I guess he’s written &lt;a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/eternitytohere/"&gt;some sort of extended blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it). Leading up to this, however, I brought up the question of what it means to require a sufficiently large, smooth, potential energy dominated patch of the universe in order for inflation to begin. I referred to &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9811037"&gt;a paper I wrote&lt;/a&gt; many years ago with &lt;a href="http://www.phys.cwru.edu/faculty/?vachaspati"&gt;Tanmay Vachaspati&lt;/a&gt; and I thought that it might be useful to describe that work here. I’ve done this before, over at &lt;a href="http://orangequark.blogspot.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orange Quark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it can’t hurt to have a version here also. This will be a little more technical than usual, but far less technical than the actual paper (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I first learned about inflation, the idea can be summarized as the following: the universe is born and one can say very little about it since quantum gravity (whatever that is) is undoubtedly important at extremely early times. However, after some time (approximately the Planck time), the semi-classical universe emerges, and we can begin to analyze meaningfully such things as the dynamics of field theories, and the response of gravity to them. There is no a priori reason for the universe to be homogeneous at this epoch. However, local, causal particle dynamics can act to homogenize patches of the universe. After some time, a small patch becomes homogeneous and dominated by the vacuum energy of a scalar field. This patch then undergoes inflation - a quasi-exponential period of expansion in which the original small patch expands to a size many orders of magnitude larger than the observable universe today. This expansion explains the flatness of the universe, and its homogeneity on large scales today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a number of models of inflation in which the above story is modified (in particular, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;chaotic inflation&lt;/span&gt;), and I’ll get back to them later. For now let me focus on this claim of homogeneity in the theories I described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does inflation, as described, “solve” the homogeneity (or horizon) problem? Clearly, the idea is that the homogeneity of the initial pre-inflationary patch, explained by causal physics, is translated into the homogeneity of the larger space after the exponential expansion. At the risk of being pedantic, this can only be true if the original patch is made homogeneous by causal processes, otherwise homogeneity would once again be an assumption, albeit a less severe one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we do in our paper? We first imagined that the early universe, emerging from the Planck epoch, was not inflating. To make progress we’ll need a few definitions, which I’ll define below in a more blog-friendly way than in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on spherically symmetric space-times and pick an origin. Then examine spherical surfaces centered on this origin. Such surfaces can be divided into three categories in the following way. Imagine sitting on such a surface with two flashlights, both pointing radially and close together. The flashlights can both be pointing outwards (away from the origin), or both pointing inwards (towards the origin). The categories are then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;NORMAL&lt;/span&gt;: When the flashlights point inwards, the rays converge to the origin. When they point outwards, the rays diverge away from the origin. This is how regular parts of space-time behave; for example, points in our universe closer to us than the horizon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;TRAPPED&lt;/span&gt;: When the flashlights point inwards, the rays converge to the origin. When they point outwards, the rays still converge to the origin. Such surfaces can be found inside the horizon of a black hole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;ANTI-TRAPPED&lt;/span&gt;: When the flashlights point inwards, the rays nevertheless diverge away from the origin. When they point outwards, the rays diverge away from the origin. Such surfaces can be found, for example, beyond the horizon in our universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back to what our paper showed. If the universe is not born inflating, then we want to imagine that, at some later time, local, causal particle dynamics yield a patch that is homogeneous and vacuum-dominated, and thus begins to inflate. The fundamental question for us was; how small can this patch be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main tool we used is called the Raychaudhuri equation. It describes the rate of change of divergence of close by pairs of light rays, as I described above. The equation is a little complicated but, by considering the types of light rays I mentioned above (perpendicular to spherical surfaces), and by making two further assumptions: that the Einstein equations are satisfied, and that the weak energy condition holds (matter isn’t too weird), the most important consequence of the Raychaudhuri equation can be stated as: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Light rays pointing inwards cannot emanate from a normal surface and cross an anti-trapped one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Well, if the original inflating patch is smaller than the Hubble size of the background space-time, then, it can be shown that light rays violating the above statement must exist. Thus, we conclude that the size of the initial inflating patch is at least as large as the Hubble size of the background space-time. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;But&lt;/span&gt; this size is large compared to typical particle physics processes that can act to homogenize a region (actually, if the background space-time is radiation-dominated FRW, the Hubble size IS the causal horizon). Thus, in this simple context it is hard to see how such an initially homogeneous inflating patch might form. This was our main result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the things Sean and I discussed on blogginheads.tv was eternal inflation - the idea, supported by careful calculations in some models, that it is possible that inflation, if it begins in one patch of the universe, gives rise to an infinite expanding space, which produces an infinite number of regions of the universe that look like ours. This provides a very different was to think about the probability for inflation beginning, and seems to provide a possible way around the problem we pointed out. Furthermore, it may provide a way to seek answers to some of the other big questions of the earliest times in the universe - many of which depend on a full understanding of the issue of initial conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

That is one of the brain’s functions that we take for granted – and do not even realize that it is a function of the brain or that it is necessary – until it is not functioning. When that happens we have an out-of-body experience (OBE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to modern neuroscience, OBEs were interpreted as mystical or spiritual experiences. In many cultures they were provoked by drugs during spiritual rituals. They have also been reported during certain dream states and in near-death experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless one is a neuroscientist or has a keen interest in how the brain works, we tend to think of our mental selves as an integrated whole and not as a collection of independent functions – the latter is more close to the truth. Our brains are more like committees with many different parts carrying out specific functions – some conscious, some unconscious. But since we are our brains we are only aware of the net effect of that part of our brain function that produces our conscious awareness and attention. We are not aware of the bickering committee operating behind the scenes, and therefore we are not aware of all the subconscious tasks being carried out by individual components of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is – until one of them stops working. Then we experience a bizarre alteration is our consciousness. There are many interesting examples of this. We can easily understand how if the part of our brain that controls the movement of our left arm is damaged, our left arm becomes paralyzed – we can’t move it. But what happens when the part of the brain that maps the left side of the world is damaged? Then we not only cannot move the left side of our body, we cannot think about the left side of ourselves or the world (a syndrome called “neglect”). Patients with this lesion, usually following a stroke, do not know their left arm is weak, they do not know they have a left arm. If you show them their own left hand they will say that it is yours, or someone else’s. You cannot convince them that it is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another part of the brain that gives us the sense of ownership over the various parts of our bodies (separate from the mapping of the world above). In rare cases after damage this ownership module can lose its input from a paralyzed limb and instead create the illusion of ownership over an imaginary limb (a supernumerary phantom limb). People with this condition feel as if they have an extra limb – they can see it and feel it, and even scratch themselves with it. But of course, they cannot manipulate reality outside themselves with it, because it does not exist except in the crossed wiring in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, there are parts of the brain that make us feel as if we are inside our own bodies. This is not an automatic consequence of being our physical selves – our brains have to specifically create the sensation that we exist inside our bodies – that we are placed in three-dimensional space behind our eyes. Our brain gives us an in-body experience, and therefore when this part of the brain is disrupted we have an OBE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What researchers have been working on are ways to artificially create, at will, an OBE. What they learned is that the creation of an in-body experience is partly based on integrating sensory input – tactile sensation, vestibular sensation (input from the inner ear about orientation to gravity and acceleration), proprioception (sensation of where the body is in three-dimensional space) and visual input. This integration takes place in the &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/18/1829"&gt;temporoparietal junction&lt;/a&gt;, especially on the right (non-dominant) side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this is next to the area of the brain that makes us feel as if we are connected to external reality – so we feel we are in our bodies and our bodies are in the world. Disruption of this function results in what is called “derealization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What researcher have learned is that the brain can be tricked by mixing up the tactile and visual input into placing the sense of self somewhere other than where the body is actually located. They have done a &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12531-outofbody-experiences-are-all-in-the-mind.html"&gt;series of experiments&lt;/a&gt; in which a subject is wearing a virtual reality visor, so that they only see a computer-generated image. This image includes a video of their own back – so there is an image of themselves standing a few feet in front of them. When their back is stroked or otherwise stimulated, the subjects see the virtual self in front of them being stroked at the same time they feel it. Their brains try to integrate these two bits of information – that body in front of me is being stroked and I feel it, therefore I must be inside that body. This is enough to provoke an out-of-body sensation is some subjects (although not a full OBE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest experience is a variation on this same setup. This time subjects are wearing a device on their backs that can both light up and provide a vibration sensation. Subjects can therefore see the lights flashing while feeling the vibration. Sometimes, the lights are in a different area from where the vibration is, and subjects may report that they feel the vibration where they see the lights, rather than where the vibration is actually occurring. Essentially, their brains are being fed contradictory information, and it can be integrated in different ways. Once a “choice” has been made, that is what the subjects experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to visual integration of contradictory or ambiguous visual information – also known as optical illusions. Like the 2-D representation of 3-D objects, your brain can see them one way or another, and often will flip back and forth (like the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=27"&gt;spinning girl illusion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, subjects who felt the vibration where they saw the lights were more likely to place themselves physically closer to where their virtual self had been, rather than where their bodies were. When the subjects were moved back a few feet and then told to walk up to where they were standing before, those with an out-of-body sensation moved farther up, toward where their virtual self was placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is fairly well progressed in terms of figuring out what the different parts of the brain are doing to create the in-body and in-reality sensation. However, it is still in its infancy in terms of manipulating this brain function. It is promising, however, that such crude interventions can create such interesting effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, we have to speculate about the applications of this technology when it is mature. The same list crops up in most news reports, and I have discussed them here as well. If we can fully manipulate our brains integration of sensory information to create the sensation that we are inside our bodies – we can trick the brain into creating the full sensation that we are inside a virtual representation of ourselves, or an avatar. This means we can feel as if we are inside a virtual game world, that we actually are our avatars – not just watching them on a screen. I have to say – I really hope I eventually see this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more practical applications as well. This kind of manipulation may be used to make operators of robots feel as if they are the robot, not just operating it, which may significantly enhance control. This would be most important for prosthetic limbs – so when we can give someone a bionic arm they will feel that it is actually their arm, not just a piece of hardware bizarrely attached to their body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will all, of course, inevitably lead to the Matrix where people are living virtual lives inside a virtual world. These scientists may be unwittingly doing the basic science research that will later be used by our robot overlords to enslave us inside the Matrix. But I guess that’s a risk we’ll have to take.&lt;/p&gt;

I mainly keep tabs on the academic subset of this labour market. But via &lt;a href="http://archaeoastronomy.wordpress.com/"&gt;Alun&lt;/a&gt; I've received news that UK contract archaeology, the business where you remove and document sites that get in the way of land development, is in poor shape because of the economic recession. The Institute for Archaeologists &lt;a href="http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=406"&gt;announces&lt;/a&gt; that one in six jobs in contract archaeology has been lost since the start of the recession, with more losses likely in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, there has been a tendency for archaeological unemployment to vary in counterphase with that of other professions. In other words, when everybody else experiences a boom, we get a bust, and vice versa. This is because in a quasi-socialist state, the government usually invests in public works to combat unemployment during a recession, and public works generate a need for contract archaeology. But I guess it's been a long time since the Labour Party in the UK advocated quasi-socialism. And judging from all the closed shops I saw in Chester back in February, the recession seems to have hit the UK much harder than Sweden. (My &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/gonzo_investment_suggestion.php"&gt;crappy mutual fund&lt;/a&gt; has gained 7% in the past two months, yay!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still, this is actually unimportant news to would-be archaeologists. Because when there are 10 000 archaeologists and 600 jobs, it makes no difference if 100 of those jobs disappear. The only reasonable way to do archaeology and have a good life is to work four days a week as a doctor / lawyer / engineer, and spend Fridays and weekends doing amateur archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not shedding too many tears over the tsunami of bad press the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN) is receiving right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/08/05/australian-skeptics-strike-back-against-antivaxxers/"&gt;I’ve written about them before&lt;/a&gt;, oh yes. They are the ones headed by Meryl Dorey, the woman who says vaccinations are dangerous, who says no one dies of pertussis, who says that it’s better not to vaccinate, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmymvZefhKY"&gt;who insinuates&lt;/a&gt; (at the 11:50 mark of that video) that doctors only vaccinate children because it’s profitable for them. She says that, even though on that live TV program &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/05/04/antivax-kills/"&gt;she sat a few feet away from Toni and David McCaffery&lt;/a&gt;, parents who had just lost their four week old daughter to pertussis because she was too young to be vaccinated yet and the herd immunity in Sydney was too low to suppress the pertussis bacterium. This year alone, three babies in Australia, including young Dana McCaffery, &lt;a href="http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2009/07/17/pandemic-strikes-perfect-storm-hits/"&gt;have died from pertussis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not enough parents are vaccinating their children. And groups like the AVN spread misinformation about vaccines, spread it like a foul odor on the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote a few days ago, the AVN will be investigated for their propaganda about vaccines. And now Dick Smith, an Australian businessman and founding skeptic there, &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/08/05/dick-smith-funds-an-australian-skeptics-ad-warning-parents-about-the-avn/"&gt;has sponsored a devastating ad&lt;/a&gt; created by the Australian Skeptics. The ad ran in The Australian, a national newspaper, on Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30675849@N05/3796616497/sizes/l/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2661/3796616497_d0007277d9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click it to see it full-size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad has picked up some press of its own; &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/07/2649266.htm"&gt;it was covered by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation website&lt;/a&gt;. The AVN claims they are not antivax, but instead are pro choice. Dick Smith disagrees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are actually anti-vaccination and they should put on every bit of their material that they are anti-vaccination in great big words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/COMPLAINT-to-HCCC-1.pdf"&gt;The evidence&lt;/a&gt; is on his side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an article on the ad on &lt;a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/26787/1066/"&gt;ITWire&lt;/a&gt;, too. Word is spreading. You can help: blog about this. Tell people about this. Put it on Facebook, on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By spreading misinformation about vaccinations the AVN is scaring parents. The herd immunity is low in part because parents are scared to vaccinate their children. &lt;strong&gt;The low herd immunity is killing babies.&lt;/strong&gt; It really is just that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter recently found my cache of old home movies from when she was a baby. We’ve been laughing, watching her eat and play and be silly when she was just a few months old. Then I think of Toni and David McCaffery and a piece of my heart dies. Then I think of the AVN, and it screams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are one of the greatest triumphs of humanity; the ability to save &lt;em&gt;hundreds of millions&lt;/em&gt; of lives through a simple inoculation. But because some people cannot accept reality, innocent human lives will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud Dick Smith and the Australian skeptics, including my friends Rachael Dunlop and Richard Saunders, for undertaking this heroic effort of shining a bright light on the AVN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antivaxxers must be stopped.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I would not spend much time on it, except that even some recognized "news" organizations are giving it coverage. In any case, this ridiculous argument comes from a YouTube video: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHUZXgNAWo"&gt;YouTubeVideo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="color:red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[John's 3/26/10 Edit: The YouTube video was updated since Dr, Avalos wrote this post. But &lt;a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/new-harris-poll-the-gops-must-be-crazy/"&gt;24% of Republicans think President Obama is the antichrist&lt;/a&gt;. LOL!!!] &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a man calling himself  PPSimmons (the presumed  narrator of the YouTube video), Barack Obama is mentioned in Luke 10:18, where Jesus is recorded as saying:&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; “And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven.” &lt;/span&gt;The narrator tells us to focus on two words:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;A. Lightning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;B. Heaven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then tells us that Strong’s Concordance (words 1299 and 1300) records the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek word ASTRAPE (“lightning”) to be BARAQ.  This equivalence seems sound enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But PPSimmons has more trouble establishing the Hebrew for the second Greek word, OURANOS (“heaven”), which normally would be SHAMAYIM in Hebrew.  Yet, PPSimmons wants to convince us that the word really should not be “heaven” (SHAMAYIM) in the sense of where God lives, but more like the “heights,” which he claims would be closer to the Hebrew BAMAH.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve such a Hebrew equivalent, the narrator refers us to Luke 8:5, where we find the phrase “birds of the air,” which is a rendition of the Greek PETEINA TOU OURANOU.  The narrator says that this proves that the Greek OURANOS, normally translated as “heaven” does not refer to the heaven of God (birds don’t live there) but to the parts of our own atmosphere where birds fly, and which is also the realm of Satan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, PPSimmons now has found BARAQ + BAMAH in a hypothetical Hebrew or Aramaic version of Luke 10:18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;WHAT’S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are so many things wrong with this argument that one wonders where to begin. But here are some brief responses:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The narrator has the WRONG Hebrew root for the name Barack if we accept President Obama's explanation for his name. President Obama’s explanation of his name may be found in, among other places, the 2004 National Democratic Convention speech: “They would give me an African name, Barack, or ‘blessed,’ believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.” See&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/%20http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2004/demconvention/speeches/obama.html"&gt;Obama’s explanation &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Obama meant by “African” is simply an African language version of a well-known Semitic root (BRK) for “blessed” that can be found in Arabic and Hebrew.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since his name means “blessed,” then this name is related to the Hebrew word BARAK, spelled with Hebrew Kaph, not a Qoph. These are two entirely different consonants and phonemes in Hebrew.  The Hebrew BARAK and BARAQ are from two entirely different roots, with  ONLY the latter meaning “lightning.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. It is most suspect to use Luke 8:5 to argue that “OURANOS” (heaven) in Luke 10:18 should be associated with the Hebrew BAMAH (“high places”).  Just because OURANOS in Luke 8:5 can refer to the normal part of the world where birds fly does not mean that the same applies to Luke 10:18. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other texts describe Satan as living or visiting the Heaven where God lives (e.g., Job 1:6). Revelation 12:9 tells us that Satan is thrown down from Heaven. The latter text, in particular, would be much more thematically related to what is happening in Luke 10:18 than what is described in Luke 8:5 or in Isaiah 14:14, which the narrator admits has to be given a Christian interpretation to even be speaking of Satan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PPSimmons also overlooks the fact that Jesus may have been in Heaven when he beheld Satan fall from it. Why assume that Jesus is on earth when he beheld this event (which Jesus places in the past)? Even by PPSimmons' Christian theology, one would presume that Jesus was in Heaven at the time of Isaiah 14, which PPSimmons says is speaking of Satan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. To achieve the  “heights” (BAMAH) reading of Luke 10:18, PPSimmons simply uses an undocumented consensus argument that can be summarized as: &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;“Most scholars think that birds in Luke 8:5 are demonic, and so we should see the area where birds fly as the domain of the demonic.”&lt;/span&gt; But, the narrator provides no evidence that most biblical scholars have a demonic interpretation of birds in Luke 8:5, and certainly most academic biblical scholars do not. In any case, consensus arguments are not admissible unless the narrator can explain why the consensus is correct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The phrase “birds of heaven/birds of the air” is a very well-known phrase in Hebrew that is first encountered in Genesis 1:26, where the Hebrew has “OPH HA-SHAMAYIM.” One can find the same phrase in Genesis 1:30, 2:19, 6:7, 7:3, and in 1 Kings 14:11. Thus, the fact that some English translations have “birds of the air” does not mean that the original Hebrew substituted some other word (e.g., BAMAH) for SHAMAYIM. We usually DO FIND the word SHAMAYIM when speaking of "birds of the air."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. To the best of my knowledge, one NEVER finds OPH HA-BAMAH when speaking of "birds of the air" in the Hebrew Bible.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. With few exceptions (e.g., Isaiah 14:14), the Hebrew BAMAH refers not to something in mid-air (where birds fly) but to high places that are part of the solid earth. That is to say, hills or altars built on hills rather than in mid-air. These places can be built (e.g., 1 Kings 14:23) and can be destroyed (2 Kings 23:8).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. Contrary to the YouTube narrator’s statement that a Hebrew Rabbi today would translate the words of Luke 10:18 with BAMAH, the modern Hebrew translation of the New Testament published by the Society for Distributing the Holy Scriptures to the Jews translates “like lightning from the heaven” close to what I have noted: KA-BARAQ MIN-HA-SHAMAYIM. In other words, if you follow a more correct Hebrew translation THERE IS NO BARACK + BAMAH in Luke 10:18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. Of course, the YouTube narrator was unable to find Hussein, the president’s middle name, in the text, which at least would be consistent with the president’s full name.  PPSimmons cannot easily transform BAMAH into O-BAMAH without further violence to the Hebrew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. The narrator does not explain why we should see the words in Luke 10:18 as of any more significance for a link with Barack Obama than any other text we can choose.  In overwhelming number, the word root BARAK (“bless”) and its variants, are positive, and so why not say that those instances prophesy a good God-given outcome for Barack Obama?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. We can follow similar rationales to show that "PPSimmons,” in fact, was prophesied in Acts 8:9. There you will find the a corrupt magician named “Simon,” which can be related to the name “Simmons.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But note also that the letter of his initials has an equivalent in the Greek letter, PI, and that letter is repeated exactly TWICE in the Greek word (PROUPERCHEN/"he previously [practiced magic]) that follows SIMON.  That is a clue (once magically reversed and "properly understood") that, one day,  PPSimmons, a false magician of YouTube interpretations, would put forth absurd arguments. Try out your own combination with any good concordance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In sum, this is another of those very pathetic attempts at pseudo-scholarship. By using similar methods we can prove that president Obama is God’s great  “blessing” for the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: My transcriptions of Hebrew and Greek are approximate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. This week, Keith Olbermann of MSNBC, attempted to refute the YouTube video. Unfortunately, Olbermann reflects a misunderstanding of his own.  PPSimmons uses definitions 1299 and 1300 of Strong’s Concordance to establish that BARAQ means “lightning.” Olbermann used Strong’s Concordance word 1301 to say that BARAQ really means “an Israelite.” However, Olbermann did not give the rest of Strong’s definition  which, in complete form, is: “The same as 1300; Barak; an Isr.:Barak.” In other words, Strong is still saying that the name of the Israelite named Barak (Judges 4:6-22) is related to the word for “lightning.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;[First posted 8/7/09]&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-810053031977410192?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I may have to waddle through the theme park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 285 people signed up so far. There is some concern that we'll strain their parking, especially if mobs of creationists try to tie up spots early. If there is a problem, people can legally park along the county road leading to Ham's Folly, as long as you don't block access. We also have an agreement with a local farm 2 miles away to let people park there; if worst comes to worst, we'll let people know where to go and will shuttle them back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little crowd control, the Creation Theme Park has also told us they are setting up a table and tent — it&amp;#39;s nice of them, but I suspect they are more concerned about making sure chaotic milling crowds of atheists don&amp;#39;t choke up parking or the entrance. Congregate there, please. If Kool-Aid is served, however, I recommend that you don&amp;#39;t drink it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard from a lot of people that they want to get a photo of the dinosaur with a saddle. I should mention that last I heard, it was no longer there — it was out for maintenance. However, in an amusing coincidence, a van full of godless atheists on its way to Kentucky last night passed a trailer carrying…you guessed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/the_creozerg_commences_today/dinosaddle.jpeg" width="400" height="300" alt="dinosaddle.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an omen. My correspondent tells me the entire van erupted in laughter, which is precisely the response we're looking for. If you're coming, remember: don't get angry, laugh instead. We are going to be a merry, cheerful band of atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't be hauling my laptop through the museum, so I won't be live-blogging it, unfortunately. I will be using my iPhone to twitter now and then, so feel free to follow along on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/pzmyers"&gt;my account&lt;/a&gt;, or better yet, I've suggested that everyone twittering this should use the hashtag &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23creozerg"&gt;#CreoZerg&lt;/a&gt;. That link should give you a growing kaleidoscope of short reactions to our visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be posting photos on Twitter. They won&amp;#39;t be the greatest — just stuff shot with my iPhone camera — but it&amp;#39;ll give you all a taste.&lt;/p&gt;

The BBC report that -          Deet bug repellent &amp;#39;toxic worry&amp;#39;     While The Telegraph are even more concerned -Insect repellent Deet is bad for your nerves, claim scientists This is in reference to a new paper about the widely-used insect repellent DEET. The BBC, as usual, performed slightly better than the Telegraph here. They included quotes from two experts making it clear that the research in question was preliminary and in no way proves that DEET is dangerous to humans. But they still ran the headline implying that DEET could be &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot;, which is the only thing most people will remember about the article. As you&amp;#39;ll see below, this is quite misleading.DEET is an insect repellant, generally used to prevent mosquito bites. You spray it on your skin, clothes, mosquito nets, etc. If you&amp;#39;ve ever been to a tropical country, you&amp;#39;ll probably remember it. It has a distinctive smell, it stings the eyes and throat, and, most distressingly, it dissolves plastics. My watch fell off in Thailand because DEET ate through the strap.That aside, DEET is believed to be safe, so long as you spray it instead of drinking it. Hundreds of millions of people have used it for decades. And it works, which means it saves lives. Mosquitoes spread diseases like malaria, yellow fever, Dengue, and plenty more. They can all kill you. This is why any health professional will advise you to use mosquito-repellants, preferably DEET-based ones, when visiting risk areas.So it would be massive news if DEET was found to be dangerous. But it hasn&amp;#39;t. What&amp;#39;s been found is that, in animals and in test-tubes, DEET is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Cholinesterase is an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter. If you inhibit cholinesterase, ACh levels rapidly increase. This can cause problems because ACh is the transmitter that your nerves use to communicate with your muscles. As ACh builds up, your muscles don&amp;#39;t stop contracting, and you suffer paralysis, until you can&amp;#39;t breathe. This is how &amp;quot;nerve gas&amp;quot; works.But we know DEET isn&amp;#39;t a strong cholinesterase inhibitor, when used normally, because people don&amp;#39;t get cholinergic effects after using it. The toxicity of cholinesterase inhibitors is acute. You get paralyzed, and suffer other symptoms like uncontrollable salivation, crying, vomiting, and incontinence. You&amp;#39;d know if this happened to you.Cholinesterase inhibitors are not, as various media reports have said about DEET, &amp;quot;neurotoxic&amp;quot; , they do not cause &amp;quot;neural damage&amp;quot;. They act on the nerves, but they do not damage the nerves. In fact people with Alzheimer&amp;#39;s take them (in low doses!), as do people with the nerve disease myasthenia gravis.So the fact that DEET can act as a cholinesterase inhibitor in the lab changes nothing. It&amp;#39;s still safe, at least until evidence comes along that it actually causes harm in people who use it. You can&amp;#39;t show that something is harmful by doing an experiment showing how it could be harmful in theory.To be fair, there is one cause for concern in the paper - in the experiments, DEET interacted with other cholinesterase inhibitors, leading to an amplified effect. That suggests that DEET could become toxic in combination with cholinesterase inhibitor insecticides, but again, the risk is theoretical.The media should never have reported on this paper. The science itself is perfectly good, but the results are completely irrelevant to the average person who might want to use DEET. They are of interest only to biologists. If people decide not to use DEET on the basis of these reports, they are putting themselves in danger. Others have noted that journalists almost always report on laboratory experiments like these as if they were directly relevant to human health. They&amp;#39;re not.Appendix: In one of the articles, an expert says that &amp;quot;I also would guess that the actual concentration [of DEET] in the body is much lower than they had to use in the study to see an effect in the mouse tissues.&amp;quot; But we don&amp;#39;t have to guess, we can work it out. DEET had detectable effects in mammalian tissues at a concentration of 0.5 millimole. A millimole is a unit of concentration; 1 millimole is 0.19 grams DEET per liter of water. (Molar weight of DEET = 191g/mole). The human body is 60% water by weight. A person weighs, say, 75 kg, which means roughly 50 liters of water. That means that to achieve the level of DEET used in this study, you would need to absorb into your body about 50 x 0.19 = 9.5 grams of DEET (assuming it was evenly distributed in your body).That&amp;#39;s a huge amount. But maybe it&amp;#39;s not completely impossible, bearing in mind that DEET might be absorbed through the skin? Is there any data on DEET levels in humans? Yes. This paper reports on the development of a way of measuring DEET in human blood. This method could detect DEET at levels from 1 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL. I assume that the upper limit was chosen because no-one ever gets more DEET than that. 100 ng / mL = 100 micrograms / L = 0.52 micromolar = 0.0005 millimolar. That&amp;#39;s 1000-fold too low, and that&amp;#39;s the upper limit.This was just a back-of-the-envelope calculation so please feel free to critique it, but, I find it reassuring.Corbel, V., Stankiewicz, M., Pennetier, C., Fournier, D., Stojan, J., Girard, E., Dimitrov, M., Molgo, J., Hougard, J., &amp;amp; Lapied, B.

&lt;p&gt;First, this Iowa atheist ad &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/05/atheist-bus-campaign-in-iowa/"&gt;went up on 20 buses&lt;/a&gt; in Des Moines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IowaBus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IowaBus.jpg" alt="IowaBus" title="IowaBus" width="550" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, we found out the ad &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/06/why-were-the-atheist-bus-ads-in-iowa-taken-down/"&gt;would be taken down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason?  Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority (DART) advertising director &lt;strong&gt;Kirstin Baer-Harding&lt;/strong&gt; wasn’t sure.  She said that the ads never should’ve been put up in the first place… and that there were too many complaints, presumably from Christians offended by I-don’t-know-what.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which was it?  Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governor Chet Culver&lt;/strong&gt; — a Democrat — also weighed in on the debate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I was disturbed personally by the advertisement and I can understand why other Iowans were also disturbed by the message.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe he understands it, but I don’t.  If anyone can explain what about the ad is so offensive, that would be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the ads &lt;a href="http://www.whotv.com/news/who-story-atheist-ads-folo-080609,0,795636.story"&gt;may now be coming back&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thursday the chair of DART’s Board of Directors, Angela Connolly, told Channel 13 that DART has now actually received more calls supporting the ads than against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DART has asked the atheist group to submit a new advertisement for consideration. Connolly says she has been told the atheist group will meet tomorrow to discuss the offer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, yay for the victory, and thanks to all those who wrote or made phone calls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, why do the atheists need to submit a new ad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If DART would like to explain what was wrong with the previous one, then we’ll talk about replacing it.  Until then, there’s no need to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACLU is asking for DART to “provide them with their policy for accepting and denying advertisers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DART is being wishy-washy and unprofessional.  Either they need to set rules and abide by them, or they need to stop taking down ads that offend the most sensitive of religious believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/06/christians-do-you-defend-your-own-freedom/"&gt;Christians who voiced their support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Ben&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A friend and I were joking about being "older than dirt" and he asked a question I thought you might enjoy: "Hey, ask Ethan how old dirt is and how it got here."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
You did the smart thing by coming to me, because the alternative is to &lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080223175924AAOCuRS"&gt;ask yahoo&lt;/a&gt;.  (Shudder!)  Well, right away, we've got an upper limit, because the entire Solar System is only about 4.5 billion years old.  So, there's no way that this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/Green%20Dirt.jpg" width="500" alt="Green Dirt.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is any older than this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/SolarSystem.gif" width="500" alt="SolarSystem.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can definitely go looking for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldest_rock"&gt;oldest rocks&lt;/a&gt; on Earth, and if you look very hard, you'll find rocks that are &lt;b&gt;4.4 billion years old&lt;/b&gt;, or nearly as old as the Earth itself!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/Jack_hills_etm_1999208.jpg" width="500" alt="Jack_hills_etm_1999208.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rocks come courtesy of the Jack Hills in Western Australia.  But, that's rock, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the dirt you're used to seeing.  Because the Earth is an active planet, with oceans, rains, winds, and mobile &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"&gt;tectonic plates&lt;/a&gt;, what we commonly know as "dirt" gets recycled over and over again.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does that work?  Well, let's go through a brief version of the history of dirt on Earth.  The interior of the Earth is molten, and this heat comes up from somewhere.  Right now, the sea floor is spreading in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/v41n1-smith1en_5017.jpg" width="500" alt="v41n1-smith1en_5017.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This causes the plates to spread &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; from the ridge.  As these plates tend to move around, two of them will, at some point, collide together.  What happens when we get a collision of plates?  We form mountain ranges!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/china-himalayas.jpg" width="500" alt="china-himalayas.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the Himalayas, not only the &lt;i&gt;tallest&lt;/i&gt; mountain range in the world, but also one of the &lt;i&gt;youngest&lt;/i&gt; mountain ranges in the world.  Compare this to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Appalachians"&gt;the Appalachian mountain range&lt;/a&gt;, which is less than &lt;i&gt;one-quarter&lt;/i&gt; of the height of the Himalayas, but which is the &lt;i&gt;oldest&lt;/i&gt; mountain range in the world, with parts dating back as far as 480 million years!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/114500-004-FD8FDDD8.jpg" width="500" alt="114500-004-FD8FDDD8.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, even 480 million years ago, the world was teeming with plants, animals, bacteria, rain, winds, and lots of other things that erode rock and produce dirt.  But, this dirt, especially sand and topsoil, is subject to the most relentless force of all on Earth: &lt;b&gt;gravity&lt;/b&gt;.  Over time, this dirt finds its way --one way or another -- to the lowest elevation possible, which is to say, the bottom of the ocean.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/stellaslide.jpg" width="500" alt="stellaslide.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, although rocks may be over 4 billion years old, &lt;i&gt;dirt isn't&lt;/i&gt;.  In fact, after the end of the last ice age (around 12,000 years ago), glaciers moved much of the topsoil around North America, leaving many regions scarred and soil-less.  And yet, plants, wind, rain, ice, animals, and other factors immediately began creating soil again.  While there is most definitely "old" dirt that is many tens of thousands of years old, most of the dirt that's out there, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MO4QFKshlVcC&amp;amp;pg=PA89&amp;amp;lpg=PA89&amp;amp;dq=soil+ice+age&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=0oh66RsUxu&amp;amp;sig=Ky4qf2VNrXbTjZsNgndYsqfmMVQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=r1J7SrjRLYH-tQPC7bHvCg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=soil%20ice%20age&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;as best as I've been able to find&lt;/a&gt;, is just a few thousand years old.  Or, you know, as old as some of the oldest &lt;i&gt;trees&lt;/i&gt; we have:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/pd1300202.jpg" width="500" alt="pd1300202.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time someone tells you you're older than dirt, you'll be able to smile to yourself, knowing that dirt on Earth isn't nearly as old as they think it is.  It's just rock that's been reduced to a dusty pulp over the last few thousand years.  Not so old, at least, geologically speaking.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/08/older_than_dirt/moondust.jpg" width="500" alt="moondust.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until someone tells you that you're older than &lt;b&gt;Moon&lt;/b&gt; dirt.  That &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; billions of years old, and that's old any way you slice it.  So watch out; those are fightin' words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/08/older_than_dirt.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249636761328"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3816">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/486cd0cab60e7cf3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science and medicine"/><category term="birds"/><category term="brains"/><category term="cognition"/><category term="science"/><title type="html">How Smart Are Birds?</title><published>2009-08-07T09:00:18Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T09:00:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/08/07/how-smart-are-birds/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of them are fairly dumb.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Aesop’s fable &lt;img src="http://www.cell.com/images/glyphs/u201c.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;The Crow and the Pitcher,&lt;img src="http://www.cell.com/images/glyphs/u201d.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt; a thirsty crow uses stones to raise the level of water in a pitcher and quench its thirst. A number of corvids have been found to use tools in the wild [&lt;a name="back-bib1" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib2" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib3" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib4" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;], and New Caledonian crows appear to understand the functional properties of tools and solve complex physical problems via causal and analogical reasoning [&lt;a name="back-bib5" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib6" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib7" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib8" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib9" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib10" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib10"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a name="back-bib11" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib11"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]. The rook, another member of the corvid family that does not appear to use tools in the wild, also appears able to solve non-tool-related problems via similar reasoning [&lt;a name="back-bib12" href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2809%2901455-9#bib12"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. Here, we present evidence that captive rooks are also able to solve a complex problem by using tools. We presented four captive rooks with a problem analogous to Aesop’s fable: raising the level of water so that a floating worm moved into reach. All four subjects solved the problem with an appreciation of precisely how many stones were needed. Three subjects also rapidly learned to use large stones over small ones, and that sawdust cannot be manipulated in the same manner as water. This behavior demonstrates a flexible ability to use tools, a finding with implications for the evolution of tool use and cognition in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So, the rooks used rocks to raise the level of water in a container in order to grab a yummy worm. They learned that rocks work better than wood dust, and they figured out that different sized rocks displace different amounts of water. That’s some fairly complicated tool use, which according to scientific concensus should take a fair amount of cognitive power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can these birds do these amazing things? Their brains are so small!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a reaction more like, “how did it take so long for someone to try this test?” If our brains are so big and wonderful, allowing us so much processing prowess, why is it so hard for us to devise ways to delve into the minds of other animals (nevermind our own). To me, this is a perfect example of scientists finally finding an appropriate test with which to peer into an animal’s abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times when an experiment isn’t working, getting it to work is a matter of changing the way the question is posed, or being creative with the experimental design. This is especially true when working with animals. In my own experience, I have been outsmarted by many a magpie and scrub jay who just didn’t want to do the experiment the way I did. Not seeing eye to eye with the birds forced me to rethink the way I was doing the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For goodness sake, for years it was thought that birds had little to no sense of smell simply because the olfactory bulb would come unattached from the rest of the brain, and get lost in the processing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, the point of this is that we can never jump to conclusions about the way things work in the world because we have probably failed in some way to come up with just the right test because we haven’t looked at the problem from all perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

I love Danish modern furniture; my cousin had some pieces she no longer wants; my sister was willing to drive out in a truck to get them. Alex would be at school while all this furniture moving and acquiring took place, so there’d be time to get the new bed assembled, the old cabinet emptied and the new one filled. In other words, what could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:410px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/08/furniture.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of SOCIALisBETTER (flickr.com)" width="400" height="248"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of SOCIALisBETTER (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few things. When we got back and had finished unloading all the bed pieces and various other things, the countdown to Alex’s arrival from school had already begun: we had just about two hours. We cleared floor space, cleaned under the bed (pretty scary, after eight years) and started to put the bed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First problem: no hardware. Jeff had been declaring that it must be missing, and I’d been nervously and hopefully saying that maybe it was one of those beds where attached hardware simply slides together without extra screws. One of our building’s maintenance workers came up to see if he had the right hardware, and Alex kept popping in to see what was going on, in the process knocking things over or stopping to paw through anything that seemed interesting, including some bras that he held up for the maintenance guy to see. Luckily I am too irritated and exhausted to waste any extra energy on being embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the bed can’t be put together, and Jeff is very un-pleased. Meanwhile, our apartment is in shambles (old furniture still here, new furniture either in pieces in the bedroom or shoved against windows). We pushed our dining room table closer to the wall to have a little more clear space; Alex cannot stand that it’s in a different place and keeps trying to pull it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see now that this all could have been planned very differently, perhaps to take place during the week Alex is at sleepaway camp, and certainly by double-checking the bed hardware. Which would only be fair, given that Ned will come home tomorrow to some significant home changes. Only fair to treat Alex to the same surprising experience.&lt;/p&gt;

Consequently, we are publishing the following guest post by &lt;strong&gt;Samuel Homola&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;D.C.,&lt;/strong&gt; a retired chiropractor who limited his practice to science-based methods and spoke out against the irrational and abusive practices of his colleagues. He is the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Chiropractic-Patients-Consumer-Library/dp/1573926981"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Chiropractic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chirobase.org/05RB/BCC/00c.html"&gt;Bonesetting, Chiropractic, and Cultism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and co-author with Stephen Barrett of the skeptical &lt;a href="http://www.chirobase.org/"&gt;Chirobase website&lt;/a&gt;, a division of &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt;) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1895, Daniel David Palmer, a magnetic healer, announced that “95 percent of diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae; the remainder by luxations of other joints.” He opened the first chiropractic school in Davenport, Iowa—the Palmer Infirmary, which offered a three-week course of instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1906, D.D. Palmer’s son, Bartlett Joshua&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Palmer, a 1902 graduate of the Palmer Infirmary, took over his father’s school. In 1924, claiming that “subluxation” of any vertebra would cause disease by compressing nerves in the intervertebral foramina, B.J. Palmer introduced the  “Neurocalometer,” a thermocouple device guaranteed to locate nerve-pinching vertebral subluxations. Chiropractors were told that if they did not use this “infallible” device to measure heat differentials on the skin over the spine, they could not competently locate and adjust a subluxation.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But the Neurocalometer was not for sale. Chiropractors were forced&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to lease the instrument and then pay a monthly rent. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1930s, after nearly three decades of teaching that subluxations anywhere in the spine can cause disease, B.J. Palmer announced that&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he had found the one and only cause of disease: &lt;em&gt;subluxation of the atlas&lt;/em&gt;. Palmer concluded that subluxation of a spinal vertebra below the axis was not possible&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;because vertebrae below that level&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were bound together by intervertebral discs and interlocking joints. Students at the Palmer School of Chiropractic&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were not permitted to adjust the spine below the axis until 1949 when full-spine techniques were once again included in the course of instruction. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.J. Palmer’s “hole-in-one” (HIO) technique for adjusting the atlas and the axis remained popular among certain factions of the chiropractic profession. According to the 2005 edition of &lt;em&gt;Job Analysis of Chiropractic&lt;/em&gt;, published by the National Board of Chiropractic Examines, 25.7% of practicing chiropractors include the “Palmer upper cervical/HIO” technique in their adjustive procedures.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NUCCA Club &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the National Upper Cervical Chiropractic Association (NUCCA) specialize in adjustment of the atlas, using the procedure as an exclusive treatment for a great variety of ailments. “The focus of the NUCCA work is the relationship between the upper cervical spine (neck) and its influence on the central nervous system and brain stem function. It is this relationship that affects every aspect of human function from the feeling sensations in your fingers to regulating hormones, controlling movement, and providing the ability to hear, see, think, and breathe.” &lt;a href="http://www.nucca.org.)/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The mission of NUCCA is defined as “Maximizing the human health potential as associated with the reduction of the Atlas Subluxation Complex (ASC).” (nucca.org)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a broad and inclusive definition, NUCCA practitioners adjust the atlas as a treatment for ailments ranging from allergies and ear infections to multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. (See &lt;a href="http://www.ucc-ny.com/"&gt;http://www.ucc-ny.com&lt;/a&gt; for a list of conditions treated by NUCCA practitioners.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUCCA Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to locate “minor and pain-free atlas subluxations” that allegedly cause “brainstem ischaemia” and compromise brainstem neural pathways, NUCCA practitioners commonly use these dubious procedures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A supine leg-length check that reveals disparities in leg length when the head is turned left or right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Use of thermography or infrared thermocouple devices to measure skin temperature over the cervical spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A postural analysis using the “NUCCA Anatometer” that requires standing on a platform apparatus that measures postural imbalance, pelvic distortion, head tilt, and unequal right and left leg weight bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Three x-ray views of the atlas-axis area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Use of a protractor to measure atlas alignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient is then placed in a side-posture position so that the heel of the hand (pisiform bone) or a machine stylus can be used to adjust the “misaligned” atlas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUCCA Treatment of High Blood Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NUCCA approach to treating human ailments received unexpected support recently when a pilot study published in a legitimate medical journal suggested that correcting atlas misalignment would reduce early high blood pressure. A larger clinical study of the effect of upper cervical manipulation on Stage 1 hypertension will soon be done at the Palmer College of Chiropractic under a grant awarded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. “This project will replicate and expand upon a recent study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension, which found that a specific chiropractic technique known as National Upper Cervical Chiropractic Association (NUCCA) is effective in lowering high blood pressure within a small group of hypertensive patients. The study will involve eight weeks of chiropractic care in 155 patients. The clinical site for patient care will be at Palmer’s Davenport Campus.” (&lt;em&gt;Chiropractic Economics&lt;/em&gt;, Chiropractic News, May 2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Views and Opinions of a Skeptic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been convinced that manual therapy of any kind can produce a permanent reduction in blood pressure. Some forms of manual therapy can temporarily lower blood pressure while others may temporarily raise blood pressure. Tension relief or relaxation that occurs as a result of manual therapy may temporarily lower some forms of high blood pressure, but I don’t know of any way that neck manipulation can permanently reduce high blood pressure, which has many causes unrelated to the neck. Except in cases involving gross anatomical abnormality or injury to the upper cervical area, affecting vascular structures, there is no reason to believe that slight misalignment of the atlas would affect blood pressure, especially the minor, painless “subluxations” routinely adjusted by NUCCA upper cervical chiropractors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in chiropractic school back in the early 1950s, I learned from Best &amp;amp; Taylor’s &lt;em&gt;Physiological Basis of Medical Practice &lt;/em&gt;that compression of the carotid sinus at its bifurcation in the upper cervical area would cause a fall in blood pressure and heart rate by raising the pressure in the sinus, while pressure on the common carotid artery in the lower cervical area would raise arterial pressure and heart rate by reducing pressure within the carotid sinus. Such effects resulting from manual stimulation are, of course, temporary, and not a cure for essential hypertension or for high blood pressure caused by bad kidneys, diseased arteries, and other organic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever effect neck manipulation might have on blood pressure, the claim by chiropractic NUCCA “upper cervical specialists” that they can lower blood pressure by correcting minor misalignments of the atlas to relieve “brain stem ischaemia” and to normalize brainstem neural pathways is too implausible to be taken seriously. When the atlas is freely movable and is not locked by painful disease or injury, its resting place, which is determined by the anatomical structure of the articulating surfaces of the occiput, the atlas, and the axis, cannot be changed. NUCCA chiropractors may simply measure structural asymmetry to determine if the atlas is misaligned. Since there are no intervertebral discs and no interlocking joints in the articulation of the atlas with the occiput and the axis, the atlas will move when manipulated, as it does in everyday head movement, but the atlas always returns to its anatomically dictated resting place, as determined by ligamentous constraints and the contours of joint surfaces. Even when there is atlanto-occipital fixation or atlanto-axial fixation, there is no reason to believe that the brain stem would be affected if injury has not occurred and there is no anatomical deformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my 43 years of practice as a chiropractor, I was never able to determine that manipulation of the spine ever permanently changed the position of the atlas or any other vertebra that is freely movable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NUCCA chiropractor who examined and treated the patients who participated in the study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Hypertension (&lt;/em&gt;Atlas vertebra realignment and achievement of arterial pressure goal in hypertensive patients: a pilot study. Vol. 21, No. 5, 2007)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;determined alone that he had located and corrected “atlas misalignment” in otherwise healthy patients who had misalignment as indicated by imbalances detected in a supine leg length check and by other questionable operator-dependent assessments such as measuring pelvic distortion and cervical skin temperature. A “NUCCA Anatometer” was used to measure “postural asymmetries.” The treating chiropractor, who has been using the NUCCA technique for 50 years, provided both sham procedure and real treatment in this “double blind placebo-controlled” study. He believes that the atlas vertebra is the “fuse box to the body,” and that when the atlas is misaligned as little as half a millimeter bad things happen to the body. (WebMD Medical News, March 16, 2007)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, it would be difficult or impossible for a dedicated non-blinded NUCCA practitioner to provide sham intervention to one group and real treatment to another group without transmitting his belief to the patient, possibly triggering a placebo effect in the treatment group.  X-ray measurements performed by one person might be influenced by patient positioning and by the prejudice of the investigator. An attempt to replicate the findings of such a flawed pilot study with another study done in a chiropractic college using similar procedures would certainly raise questions. Short term treatment for fluctuating blood pressures in patients with Stage 1 hypertension (pressures less than 159/99 mm of Hg, with no known cause) would be difficult to evaluate.  The conclusion that “restoration of Atlas alignment is associated with marked and sustained reductions in BP” after eight weeks of weekly upper neck manipulation begs for another explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining claims that chiropractic manipulation can lower blood pressure, a study published&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a 2002 issue of &lt;em&gt;Journal of Hypertension&lt;/em&gt; (Treatment of Hypertension with Alternative Therapies Study: a randomized clinical trial. Vol. 29, No. 10) concluded that “For patients with high normal blood pressure or Stage 1 hypertension, chiropractic spinal manipulation in conjunction with a dietary modification program offered no advantage in lowering either diastolic or systolic blood pressure compared to diet alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minor atlas subluxations routinely found by NUCCA chiropractors have not been proven to be significant. I would be surprised if a legitimate properly controlled study offered proof that upper neck manipulation would permanently lower blood pressure that has an organic origin. The claim by NUCCA practitioners that a painless slightly misaligned atlas is a cause of high blood pressure does not have enough supporting evidence to warrant the risk of manipulating the necks of patients suffering from high blood pressure, risking injury to vertebrobasilar arteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of the questionable and controversial study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Human Hypertension&lt;/em&gt;, offering support for contentions that correcting a minor atlas misalignment will lower blood pressure, are being extrapolated by NUCCA chiropractors to prove that upper cervical chiropractic is an effective treatment for organic ailments. According to the chiropractor who participated in the blood pressure study, “…high blood pressure is far from the only thing an Atlas misalignment causes.” (WebMD Medical News, March 16, 2007)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the NUCCA blood pressure study did note that “The mechanism as to why this improvement in BP occurs is unknown and cannot be determined by this study,” the study itself reads like a chiropractic promotional piece. For example, the study states that “What is clear is that misalignment of the Atlas vertebra can be determined by assessment of the alignment of the pelvic crests,” adding that “…pain was not present in any of the patients randomized in this study.” Such statements may be used by chiropractors to support treatment of a variety of human ailments, based on measurement of common but insignificant vertebral misalignment or on harmless structural deviations from normal.&lt;/p&gt;

This time it’s in Iowa. And once again, what is this obscene ad that has Iowans (Iowans? Iowaians? Iowaese?) so deeply offended to their core?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Once again it’s the slogan, “Don’t believe in God? You are not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/oooooooffffeennnnssiiiiiiivvve/offensive_ad.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/oooooooffffeennnnssiiiiiiivvve/offensive_ad.jpeg" alt="" width="459" height="126"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KHAAAAAAAAAAANNN!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really Iowa? This is where you’re drawing the line? Seriously? And not only were the already purchased ads pulled from city buses but &lt;a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2009/08/06/gov-culver-atheist-bus-ad-is-offensive/"&gt;Governor Chet Culver announced that he was “disturbed, personally” by them&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, why would anyone want such a pussy to be their governor. If you can’t even stand a sign asking people if they don’t believe in gods, why should I believe this man can handle decisions about the economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fuckin’ absurd! And I hope these assholes get slapped with a discrimination suit so big they’re think they’re Job. If it were merely about bus companies afraid to lose business because of offensive ads, that would be one thing. But we all know far more offensive ads than this appear on the sides of buses every day without any significant loss of business. &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8928-Philadelphia-Atheism-Examiner~y2009m8d4-Christians-offended-by-atheist-billboards"&gt;Far more offensive ads and billboards are allowed to go up all the time when they’re from religious groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="censorship-is-un-american" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/censorship-is-un-american.jpg?w=129&amp;amp;h=178" alt="censorship-is-un-american" width="129" height="178"&gt;And it infuriates me to no end that I only see fellow atheists standing up against this injustice. This isn’t just anti-atheist. This is anti-freedom and it’s un-American. There is no law in the U.S. protecting individuals from being offended. Obscenity law is vague and its rulings are constantly overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights one of the many ways in which religion itself conflicts with American values. Not only are religious dogmas totalitarian from the core as they demand strict obediance to a great dictactor with absolute power who allegedly watches your every move, but their doctrines insist they’re always right while everyone who disagrees must be wrong, if not immoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religions like Christianity cannot tolerate dissenting views because as long as just one person disagrees with them, that person is a threat to their entire brainwashed, fascist beliefs. How incredibly sad these individuals are, that mere disagreement offends and disturbs their narrow-minded, bigoted little ideology. And its this fragility that will ultimately bring down this house of cards called religion.&lt;/p&gt;

The 15% number gets bandied about a lot in atheist circles, but it should not be.  Rarely does anyone actually claim that we make up 15% of America, but you will hear them talking enthusiastically about how 15% of the U.S. is non-religious or sometimes even slip into “We’re the second largest religious group in the U.S.”  That’s because 15% is about the number who when asked about their religion in polls describe themselves as non-religious or unaffiliated.  That is very, very, very different from not believing in a god and it’s important to remember that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007 Pew conducted a very large (n = 35000) &lt;a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/"&gt;survey of American’s religious stances&lt;/a&gt;.  16.1% came in as “unaffiliated.”  But Pew, being the clever polling company that they are dug deeper.  They asked these unaffiliated people “Do you believe in God or a Universal Spirit?”  Only 22% of the unaffiliated answered no, that’s about 3.5% of the nation as a whole.  In fact, 36% of the unaffiliated were absolutely certain there is a god.  Hell, 8% &lt;em&gt;of the unaffiliated&lt;/em&gt; said that they had prayers &lt;em&gt;answered&lt;/em&gt; at least once a week.  These are not our brethren, they are simply people who don’t follow a specific denomination of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 5% of the country claimed not to believe in God.  A lot of those are Buddhists and Jews.  Only about 2% of the country as a whole claimed either atheism or agnosticism (according to &lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1181/religious-identification-of-those-who-do-not-believe-in-god"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://religions.pewforum.org/affiliations"&gt;elsewhere on the sight&lt;/a&gt; gives 1.6% atheist and 2.4% agnostic for a total of 4%), with another roughly 1.5% simply not using a label. So people who are willing to call themselves atheists make up a little more than 1% of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a lot, but we do have a growing voice.  Lets keep that voice growing, for that’s where influence really comes from. We have a huge advantage in converting people over any religion, because no one has to learn our core beliefs or tenets, all they have to do is say “I don’t believe in god” and presto-chango they can be an atheist.  This means that we don’t have to do much more than let others know that we are an option in order to convert people.  It’s easy work, but there is a little work involved.  If you are an atheist, let people know.  If you are a skeptic, definitely let people know because I’m tired of having to explain what that means to people.  Having a presence in this country, one where we aren’t so reviled that &lt;a href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/people-who-piss-me-off-part-iv/"&gt;some wish we would just shut up&lt;/a&gt; and not let anyone know about us is about making our presence known. So do it.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll begin this entry by providing some explanatory background. I'm personally involved because I'm well into the process of chemotherapy, a "clean-up" procedure following a successful operation to remove a tumor. I prepared myself by reading up on the literature, and I must say that I'm doing very well - due to very recent improvements in the process, and new medications. I've experienced none of the possible nausea, though I'm weakened physically due to a decrease in red blood cells, and I have to avoid possible infection because of a lessened resistance. This, I hope, explains my considerable reaction to the irresponsible NIH/NCI comments on the efficacy of acupuncture for the relief of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249624400438"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/in_which_the_elder_free-ride_o_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bd778ded1d91034</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kids and science"/><title type="html">In which the elder Free-Ride offspring channels Descartes.</title><published>2009-08-07T05:07:36Z</published><updated>2009-08-07T05:07:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/NEsCUiUyVbQ/in_which_the_elder_free-ride_o_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/in_which_the_elder_free-ride_o_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At bedtime, after the reading of the stories, the younger Free-Ride offspring lay upon Dr. Free-Ride's better half, and Dr. Free-Ride's better half responded by making strangling noises.

Gaming has cashed in on the explosion in computing power and networking capabilities to create highly realistic, nearly immersive playing fields. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Second Life, developed by Linden Labs, takes social networking to the next level by creating a complete virtual world, with its own self-sufficient economy. (In fact, Second Life's in-game economy prefigured the economic meltdown in the real world.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But Second Life and virtual reality aren't just for entertainment anymore. Via &lt;a href="http://physicsandcake.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/virtual-scientific-collaboration"&gt;Physics and Cake&lt;/a&gt; comes news of an article in &lt;i&gt;Physics World&lt;/i&gt; about the first professional scientific organization based entirely in virtual worlds: the &lt;a href="http://www.mica-vw.org/"&gt;Meta Institute for Computational Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; (MICA) which is the brainchild of scientists from Caltech, Princeton, Drexel University, and MIT. MICA conducts professional seminars and popular lectures in astrophysics and cosmology, as well as other special events, all in Second Life, for a membership that numbers 140 and is still growing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now they've published &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3520"&gt;a scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; on the potential of virtual worlds to enhance scientific communication and public outreach, describing immersive virtual reality as "the next-generation browser technology, which will be qualitatively different from the current, flat desktop and web page paradigm, as the current browsers were different from the older terminal screen and file director paradigm for information display and access." &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mere gaming is so 2001. "While these technologies got developed largely by the gaming industry, and there is certainly a lot of gaming going on, virtual worlds are something bigger: a general platform for all kinds of activities, ranging from entertainment to purely professional -- just like the Web itself," Caltech astrophysicist George Djorgovski told &lt;i&gt;Physics World&lt;/i&gt;. Scientific visualization, for instance, is likely to be transformed by virtual capabilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We can't wait to see the virtual physics demonstrations that will be possible in Second Life, if &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; is any indication of the creative possibilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/UM5yepZ21pI%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-3513250321621319250?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

When he was a governor, I respected much of what he stood for. He wasn’t like most politicians. Kind of like Independent candidate Kinky Friedman in Texas, Ventura was a no-nonsense guy who wasn’t afraid to tell other politicians how he really felt (usually calling them out on their bullshit bluntly and unapologetically). He rarely if ever wore a tie and didn’t seem worried about re-election. If he pissed people off, oh well. Further, he captured our imaginations, allowing us to picture a world where politicians were brutally honest and actually had integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I look at Ventura today, all I see is another wacko conspiracy theorist who denies an overwhelming amount of historical evidence in order to propagate his absurd belief that 9/11 was “an inside job” and so was the Kennedy assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the folks at “truTV” (gotta laugh at the irony) &lt;a href="http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=821360"&gt;has decided to give Ventura his own show, a show that will be specifically focused on promoting his looney beliefs&lt;/a&gt;. Ventura will host “Conspiracy Theories with Jesse Ventura.” Now I’ve worked for “truTV” myself in the past. It’s what used to be called CourtTV. Now it’s just another cesspool so-called “reality television,” light on the reality and heavy on the low-budget, unscripted crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the network’s only purchased seven episodes, which isn’t a lot of time for Ventura to build an audience unless the show is heavily promoted. After seven episodes of “The Body” teaching us history the evil historians don’t want you to know, maybe the network will follow it up with a reality show where Paris Hilton teaches us physics or Octomom teaches us math.&lt;/p&gt;

But Stein is also writes as the “Everybody’s Business” columnist, and as I mentioned in that previous blog, Stein’s role as spokesperson for this site seemed to be a clear violation of the New York Time’s own ethics guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the NY Times has finally acted and has &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5331835/pitchman-ben-stein-gets-economist-ben-stein-fired-at-the-new-york-times"&gt;fired Ben Stein as their Sunday business columnist&lt;/a&gt; because of his involvement with FreeScore.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Times spokesperson Catherine Mathis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Stein’s fine work for us as a columnist for Sunday Business had to end, we told him, after we learned that he had become a commercial spokesman for FreeScore, a financial services company. Ben didn’t understand when he signed on with FreeScore that this might pose a potential conflict for him as a contributing columnist for the Times, because he hadn’t written about credit scores or this company. But, we decided that being a commercial spokesman for FreeScore while writing his column wouldn’t be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sorry to lose him as a columnist, and appreciate his work for the Times over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awwww! Couldn’t have happened to a more deserving person.&lt;/p&gt;

So recently the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers ran a bus ad, as many atheist groups are doing these days, in Des Moines that looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Iowa Bus Ad" src="http://www.iowaatheists.org/drupal/sites/default/files/Iowa-atheist-bus-ad-sz1m.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="124"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ad was seen as so offensive by some Des Moinesians that they called up the bus company and &lt;a href="http://iowaindependent.com/18293/acknowledging-existence-of-atheists-is-too-offensive-for-des-moines"&gt;demanded it be removed, which it did&lt;/a&gt;.  This pisses me off to no end, but it doesn’t yet fit my formula of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;eople&lt;/em&gt; who piss me off. Enter &lt;a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2009/08/06/gov-culver-atheist-bus-ad-is-offensive/"&gt;Governor of Iowa Chet Culver&lt;/a&gt;, to assure me that I will have someone at whom to direct my anger!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was disturbed, personally, by the advertisement and I can understand why other Iowans were also disturbed by the message that it sent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell you how much it pisses me off that people are so offended by the very existence of people who don’t believe in a god.  It’s exactly the same as an ad saying “Muslim? You are not alone.” or “Democrat? You are not alone.” and anyone who is offended by any of those is a bigot, pure and simple.  So lets go ahead and call Governor Culver a bigot and hope he gets voted out of office as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to displays of bigotry like this is to get even louder.  Laying low with your head down is what bigots like Governor Culver want.  We atheists are lucky that we do not face the kind of violence that blacks faced during the civil rights movement, so there is no reason not to stand up for yourself.  These people aren’t going to get used to us on their own, they need our help.  We’ll win this lawsuit and get these ads back on the buses, but in the meantime take this opportunity to tell someone you otherwise might not have that you are an atheist.  People need to see us more.&lt;/p&gt;

I can obtain full text of the report for free because I’m a reader from developing country. But I only had time to read the summary section.

The report gives several recommendations to different roles in the modern scientific infrastructure. Two main ideas shared by these recommendations is that to use digital technology to fight digital frauds, and that higher transparency of both the research and peer review process is needed. However, the recommendations also show a layered strategy to fight digital frauds, from individual researchers, institutes to journals and stakeholders. Whereas indeed no single layer of effort can stop the scientific frauds once and for all, neither can the sum of them cover up the whole process, because these layers only represent the “production” part in the industry of science research. In the “mass production” age of science research, to discover with only occasional defective products cannot be successful without the help of “consumers’” feedback, which means the whole groupof readers of the research report. The wholeness should be most ensured because we are talking about very rare cases which may affect a small number of people. We are less probable to discover them if we only receive part of the report from the consumers.

The current assembly line from researchers to journals is quite perfect already, in ensuring a high percentage of qualified product of research. To discover still very rare cases of frauds, two or three reviewers invited by a journal and before publication is obviously ineffective and insufficient. The idea of “using digital technology to fight digital frauds”, or better put, &amp;quot;using IT (Information Technologies) to fight IF (Information Frauds, and also, maybe cleverer, Impact Factor), applies here. To break the space limit of printed journals so that all rather then essential research data are avaialable to the public rather than the subscribers, we have to embrace the Internet which provides us with unlimited storage space, and also allow for real open access. We also need to encourage the role of Web 2.0 activities like blogs and social network the accelerate the discovery of occasional faults and frauds in the ocean of published papers.

The recently response in the blogosphere to the JACS paper which describe the oxidative property of NaH best exemplified the above idea, although in this specific case there need not be a scientific frauds.

It begins this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt;, a book slight in both length and substance, science writers Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum argue that America's future is deeply endangered by the scientific illiteracy of its citizens and that this problem derives from two failings of scientists themselves: their vociferous atheism and their ham-handed and ineffectual efforts to communicate the importance of science to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ends this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than at any time in my life, I see Americans awash in popular science. Bookstores teem with volumes by Stephen Gould, Steven Pinker, Brian Greene, Steven Weinberg, Richard Dawkins, Michio Kaku, Edward O. Wilson, and Jared Diamond; natural history museums have become user friendly; and entire television channels are devoted to science and nature. Science education is readily available to anyone who is curious. And yes, we scientists need--and want--to share our love of science with the public. Still, we must compete with the infinite variety of claims on people's time and interests, including sports, movies, and reality shows. No matter how much atheists stifle themselves, no matter how many scientists reach out to the public via new media, we may not find the appetite for science infinitely elastic. This does not mean, of course, that we should refrain from feeding it. But figuring out where and how to intervene will take a lot more work than the shallow and unreflective analysis of &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between he describes how what little data the authors present does not support their claims, suggests that the problem of science illiteracy is much more complicated than they let on (duh), and that their suggested solutions are either trivial and suggested before, or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I don't think this review is one that Mooney and Kirshenbaum will highlight on their blog. It's probably the review that will be most influential to scientists, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, wait, that wasn't it. It was an ad announcing that god hated Christians and they were all going to burn in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I don't think that was it. It was an ad offering free bacon to anyone willing to deny the Holy Spirit, and the Iowa vegans were outraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah, don't think so. Actually, the horrible, awful, evil ad they were running was this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/08/oooooooffffeennnnssiiiiiiivvve/offensive_ad.jpeg" width="448" height="124" alt="offensive_ad.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it? "Don't believe in God? You aren't alone"? That's the ad that some people found offensive? So offensive that the &lt;a href="http://iowaindependent.com/18293/acknowledging-existence-of-atheists-is-too-offensive-for-des-moines"&gt;ad was promptly yanked from city buses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2009/08/06/gov-culver-atheist-bus-ad-is-offensive/"&gt;Governor Chet Culver announced that he was "disturbed, personally" by them&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's insane. What's the matter with those Iowans? One day they do &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/04/iowa_allows_same-sex_marriages.php"&gt;something to make us proud&lt;/a&gt;, the next they do something so petty and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, it's a clear case. There was absolutely nothing offensive about those ads, nothing that would make the horses skittish or frighten the children. Somewhere down the line, a few intolerant ignoramuses freaked out and started phoning the bus company, and a coward or a zealot somewhere in the chain of command saw an excuse to shut down a harmless advertisement. It's bigotry, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, there's also a poll:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whotv.com/news/who-poll-bus-ad-080609,0,1255139.poll"&gt;Do you think it was right for DART to remove the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers ads from its busses?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes 
21.6%&lt;br&gt;

Mitochondria contain their own DNA, separate from the DNA in the cell nucleus, a legacy of their symbiotic nature. If some crucial portions of that DNA are damaged, then a mitochondrion will become dysfunctional - and a Rube Goldberg process unfolds from this point, causing age-related degeneration as damage to mitochondrial DNA spirals outwards into increasing forms of disarray and damage in and around your cells. Unfortunately, mitochondrial DNA is comparatively unprotected, and sits right next to the mitochondrial food-processing machinery that produces all sorts of reactive, damage-inducing molecules as a matter of course. In theory a cell's repair and recycling mechanisms should destroy damaged mitochondria before things get out of hand, but in practice it doesn't work that way enough of the time. Hence damage accumulates over the years, and we witness the results of that damage as some fraction of the degenerations of aging. What I've outlined in the paragraphs above is the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. You can......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The notification of the affected parties by the Supreme Court is &lt;a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/tempx/648801.pdf" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The 21-day clock for their response began running when they received service of that notification, which would have been today or perhaps next Monday.  Then the Court has to consider what it will do.  I doubt that the hearing will resume on September 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mt. Vernon News &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/08/06/freshwater-files-suit-with-ohio-supreme-court" rel="external "&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that John Freshwater’s attorney, R. Kelly Hamilton, has filed a request for a writ of mandamus from the Ohio Supreme Court to compel the Mt. Vernon Board of Education to issue subpoenas to (at least) two of its members to testify in the administrative hearing on Freshwater’s termination as an 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade science teacher.  I cannot find the request yet on the &lt;a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/" rel="external "&gt;Ohio Supreme Court site&lt;/a&gt;.  The Court has been on summer recess, but is resuming oral arguments on August 11.  Freshwater’s request is not (yet?) on the Court’s &lt;a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/Clerk/calendar/default.asp" rel="external "&gt;oral arguments schedule&lt;/a&gt;.  I have no idea whether the Court hears oral arguments on such requests.  Is there an Ohio lawyer in the house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This request for a write of mandamus is the next step following the Knox County Court of Common Pleas &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/07/freshwater-upda.html" rel=""&gt;refusal to enforce subpoenas&lt;/a&gt; which had been quashed by the Board of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the hearing is on hiatus until at least September 10 due to Freshwater’s attorney having invoked a legal provision to recess such hearings during periods when school is not in session.&lt;/p&gt;

Ben Stein’s TV ads for a scuzzy “free” credit product have finally caught up to him: The New York Times has fired Stein as a Sunday business columnist for violating ethics guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stein was pilloried online for his endorsement of the bait-and-switch operation, which offers a free credit score but charges an outrageous $30 per month to see the credit report behind the score. As Reuters blogger Felix Salmon pointed out, consumers can get a free online report under federal law.

I also know I have been a bit of a pain in the ass about some things this semester and today one of the students made fun of me a bit about it. Somedays Dr. Isis simply cannot help the ease with which &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven"&gt;she goes straight to eleven&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it makes me think that I might spend tonight in the lab guarding our data from sabotage...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that this is a serious story and that this one nutter's selfish actions are going to cost time and resources, but there is one part of the actual story itself that made me chuckle.  I know, I know, chuckling is in bad taste.  Still, read for yourself (emphasis a la Isis)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silvya Oommachen, a former JCSG research associate, entered the SLAC facility on 18 July and removed the crystals from the freezer, according to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Matthew Quick. &lt;strong&gt;Two days later, researchers discovered the thawed samples on the lab bench in three cryogenic containers, each with handwritten post-it notes signed by her alter-ego "X black"&lt;/strong&gt;. Oommachen, who didn't show up for work after 17 June, said she was overloaded by her supervisors and felt that the vandalism would reverse some of the "bad karma" associated with her time at the lab, the affidavit says.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I can't help but think it is absolutely hilarious (and more than borderline sociopathic) that this woman developed an "alter ego" for the event AND that her alter ego was well-known enough to be identifiable as hers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, she did a horrible thing, but I had never considered having an alter ego with which to perpetrate my malfeasance.  "X black" is not terribly creative, but I have to give her an A+ for psychosis and I am not left thinking what my alter ego's name would be....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I realized, that I do have an alter ego (or at least a pseudonym), sort of.   Does this mean that I could snap at any second???  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/weekly_lab_hilarity_1.php"&gt;Dr. Buttercup&lt;/a&gt; says I should warn myself before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;

During the summer vacation season, we travel quite a bit, so it's difficult to maintain our usual pace of posting. But along the way we've collected some great photos, and we'll try to share a few of them with you when it's relevant. For example, take a look at this picture I took in Maine about a week ago:

It's a lovely section of the Maine coast, readily identifiable by anyone as "shoreline." Earlier in the summer we vacationed with our nieces on the North Carolina coast, just a few hours' drive from where we live:

Once again, this is clearly a shoreline, but it's quite different from the Maine coast. Many studies have offered evidence that recognizing a general image category like "shoreline"  uses a different mental process than recognizing a specific image -- the Maine coast photo versus the North Carolina coast photo. The most convincing evidence comes from a 1999 study by C.J. Marsolek. Marsolek showed people pictures of many different items and asked them to name them. Then the same people saw pictures in either the left or right visual field. Some of these pictures were identical to the first set, but others were in the same category (like "piano" or "dog") but a different exemplar (a grand versus upright piano; a pekingese versus an Irish setter). Objects in the left visual field (which corresponds the right hemisphere of the brain) were recognized better when they were exactly the same as previously-viewed photos rather than different examples of the same category. So the right hemisphere seems to be better at processing specific examples, while the left hemisphere is better at processing general categories.

So is this difference in processing general versus specific examples found only in the visual system, or does it extend to all our senses?

Via Gawker comes this confirmation from Times spokesperson Catherine Mathis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Stein’s fine work for us as a columnist for Sunday Business had to end, we told him, after we learned that he had become a commercial spokesman for FreeScore, a financial services company. Ben didn’t understand when he signed on with FreeScore that this might pose a potential conflict for him as a contributing columnist for the Times, because he hadn’t written about credit scores or this company. But, we decided that being a commercial spokesman for FreeScore while writing his column wouldn’t be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are sorry to lose him as a columnist, and appreciate his work for the Times over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that the German Muslims would be happy that a bunch of non-Muslim hooligans accepted Muhammad as a “prophet.”  But no, instead they focused on the part of the song maligning his ball skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, scripture makes clear that Muhammad knew plenty about &lt;a href="http://www.lastprophet.info/en/a.ali-ural/aisha-lover-of-the-beloved.html"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090318131044AAtkWzL"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrilla_in_Manila"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.prleap.com/pr/23598/"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad%27s_wives"&gt;courting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as you can check with your favorite Quranic search tool (I myself am partial to “Qoogle”), there are no mentions of “soccer,” “football,” “corner kick,” “goalie,” “Pele,” “Cruyff Turn,” “prawn sandwich brigade,” “rainbow kick,” “midfield maestro,” or “keepie uppie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that’s the end of the story.  But you’d be neglecting Muhammad’s demonstrated interest in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_death"&gt;Group of Death&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his expertise in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion"&gt;pitch invasions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in order to decide that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmeg_%28football%29"&gt;nutmeg&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://www.healthymuslim.com/articles/yiits-the-spice-nutmeg-is-haraam-unlawful.cfm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;haraam&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he would have had to be pretty familiar with the game’s nuances.  Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that Muhammad knew plenty about football.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully our &lt;i&gt;Schalkebekannten&lt;/i&gt; will issue some sort of lyrical correction, perhaps “Muhammed bent it way before Beckham,” or “Muhammed may have been a epileptic, but he knows plenty about football,” or “Even though Muhammad predated &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_football#Ninth_century"&gt;the first known reference to football&lt;/a&gt; by a couple of centuries, he was nonetheless an expert on its rules and strategies.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
SEOUL, Aug. 6 (Yonhap) — A minority tribe in Indonesia has chosen to use Hangeul as its official writing system, in the first case of the Korean alphabet being used by a foreign society, a scholars&amp;#39; association here said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tribe in the city of Bauer and Bauer, located in Buton, Southeast Sulawesi, has chosen Hangeul as the official alphabet to transcribe its aboriginal language, according to the Hunminjeongeum Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian ethnic minority, with a population of 60,000, was on the verge of losing its native language as it lacked a proper writing system, the institute said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Bauer and Bauer began to teach students the Korean alphabet last month, with lessons based on textbooks created by the Korean institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composed of writing, speaking and reading sections, all texts in the book — explaining the tribe&amp;#39;s history, language and culture — are written in the Korean script. The book also includes a Korean fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city plans to set up a Korean center next month and to work on spreading the Korean alphabet to other regions by training Korean language teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguists here expressed hope that the case will become a stepping stone to spreading and promoting the Korean alphabet globally. The Hunminjeongeum Research Institute has been trying for several years to spread the Korean alphabet to minority tribes across Asia who do not have their own writing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It will be a meaningful case in history if the Indonesian tribe manages to keep its aboriginal language with the help of Hangeul," said Seoul National University professor and member of the institute Kim Joo-won. "In the long run, the spread of Hangeul will also help enhance Korea's economy as it will activate exchanges with societies that use the language."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Lee Ho-young, who helped create the Korean textbook for the Indonesian tribe, said it was a "historical case" for the Korean alphabet to be used in preserving the traditional language of a foreign society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I hope the case will serve as a meaningful opportunity to show off the excellence of Hangeul outside of the country," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;=====&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's one small step for [an] alphabet, one giant leap for the Korean people [and their economy].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although far from the longest chapter in &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt;, I find the chapter on biogeography the single most persuasive one for showing why evolution is true.  I think Jerry finds it compelling as well. This might seem surprising since he’s a geneticist: one might think he would find some of the genetic evidence most compelling.  But I don’t think it is surprising, given that it was the biogeographic evidence, that, as the great zoogeographer P.J. Darlington put it, showed Darwin evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapirs provide a nice example of the use of multiple lines of evidence in solving a biogeographic puzzle (a puzzle noted by an alert reader in the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/how-the-tapir-got-his-spots/"&gt;comments on my first tapir post&lt;/a&gt;).  Tapirs are usually thought of as &lt;a href="http://www.tapirs.org/index.html"&gt;South American (where they are most widespread and species rich), with one species in Malaya.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="tapir map" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/tapir-map.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=353" alt="World distribution of tapirs (from Tapir Specialists Group)" width="500" height="353"&gt;&lt;p&gt;World distribution of tapirs (from Tapir Specialist Group)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you might think needs explication is the disjunct distribution.  But before tackling this, a mis-impression must be corrected: although we tend to think of tapirs as typically South American, from a historical perspective, they are recent interlopers.  Along with many other animals we consider typically South American (jaguars, llamas, peccaries), they entered South America from the north about 3 million years ago when the Panamanian portal became the Panamanian isthmus during the &lt;a href="http://www.tomgidwitz.com/main/id80.htm"&gt;Great American Interchange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then about the disjunction: how did they get from Central  America to Malaya? They didn’t.  Tapirs are a northern group.  They and their relatives date back to the lower Eocene (ca. 50 mya).  The modern genus,&lt;em&gt; Tapirus&lt;/em&gt;, dates back to the Oligocene (ca. 30 mya), and was found in Europe, Asia, and North America. They have gone extinct in Europe, most of Asia, and most of North America.  Tapirs thus have a relict distribution, being still found at two endpoints of their historical distribution. Geology, paleontology, and systematics thus combine to give a most satisfying account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Wade&lt;/strong&gt; here.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve spent a long time on this blog trying to have and to promote respectful dialogues with the many Christians who visit.  Many of you have expressed your appreciation of my courteous approach.  I now want to spend some of that “social capital” by respectfully  issuing you a challenge, and by making an appeal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRISTIANS!&lt;br&gt;
DO YOU STAND UP FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RELIGION OR NOT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your truthful answer is not shown by your words but by your &lt;em&gt;actions.&lt;/em&gt;  Yet again, another atheist bus ad has been &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/06/why-were-the-atheist-bus-ads-in-iowa-taken-down/"&gt;unfairly and illegally banned&lt;/a&gt;, this time in Des Moines, Iowa.  What are you going to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; to protest and to correct this?  We are what we do.  Our words mean nothing without actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to worship and express yourself as you wish only because of the First Amendment.  If not for that, you would not be practicing the particular faith that you are. You’d be worshiping whatever way the government dictated, and I’m sure you wouldn’t like it.  You are free only because we are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; free to follow our consciences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; liberty that is being threatened, not just that of atheists. In the comfort of their majority, most Christians blithely take it for granted, accepting the benefit but not paying anything back in responsibility, like spoiled children.  &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of us must defend our freedoms, not just those who are being trampled upon on any given day. If it is okay to stifle one group, soon enough it will be okay to stifle your group.  If you, as the majority don’t stand up to things like this, then you, more than others will richly deserve the suppression that will eventually smother us all.  The battle for all our rights is not in Iraq, it’s right here.  In &lt;em&gt;Iowa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christians:&lt;/strong&gt; At the very least I ask you to do this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/08/06/why-were-the-atheist-bus-ads-in-iowa-taken-down/"&gt;Read Hemant’s post&lt;/a&gt; to understand the story, click on the links there to phone, email or write DART, identify yourself as a Christian and tell them that &lt;em&gt;as a Christian&lt;/em&gt; you demand that the atheist bus ads be replaced back on the buses immediately.  Then post your comment here telling us what you did or did not do, and why. If you have already commented there about an action you took, copy and paste it here. If you don’t think you should have to do anything about this, then have the courage to tell us why not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atheists:&lt;/strong&gt;  Please hold back your comments for a while and let the Christians comment here so we can readily see what, if any, response they have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t happened in much depth before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Profiles_of_the_Godless_FI_AugSept_Vol_29_No_5_pps_41-45.pdf"&gt;methodology and results here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  The biggest flaw, as far as I can tell, is that only people on CFI’s mailing list were polled.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a big problem, but it’s tough to get a sampling of atheists without seeking them out specifically.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, what does the survey tell us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This new survey reports that confident nonbelievers are more emotionally healthy with respect to “fence sitters” or religious doubters, shows that “spirituals” report less satisfaction with their lives than those who identify with other self-labels, and suggests that the common assumption that greater religiosity relates to greater happiness and life satisfaction is not quite true.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all well and good, but the part that captured my attention was this graphic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Demographics.JPG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Demographics.JPG" alt="Demographics" title="Demographics" width="575" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that show us?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When given an option to describe themselves using as many labels as they wanted, the top four categories (on the left) were Atheist, Humanist, Agnostic, and Spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when asked to select the &lt;em&gt;one best&lt;/em&gt; descriptive label (on the right), we see the numbers change quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 75% of people who were comfortable using the term “atheist” felt that that was the best term to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 38% of self-described Humanists felt that was the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; term to describe themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also this table to organize some findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Image-CSH-Galen-ID-Table1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Image-CSH-Galen-ID-Table1.jpg" alt="Image-CSH-Galen-ID-Table1" title="Image-CSH-Galen-ID-Table1" width="453" height="362"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read what Galen feels are the implications of these findings &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/Profiles_of_the_Godless_FI_AugSept_Vol_29_No_5_pps_41-45.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  But before you do that, what do you think these results tell us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we use this information to our advantage?&lt;br&gt;

Members of one family of birds in particular - the Corvidae, which includes crows, rooks and ravens - have an ability to make and use tools which is at least as sophisticated as that of chimpanzees.

Two new studies, published this week, provide yet more demonstrations of the remarkable cognitive abilities of this group of birds. One shows that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, the other that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach.

Watch videos of the birds performing these tasks below.

Well, he&amp;#39;s now written an account of it in Free Inquiry - you can download it free here.The study is a survey of the labels non-believers apply to themselves, as well as a survey of their personality types and other demographics.One fascinating finding is some evidence that contradicts the widely held assumption that religious people are happiest. What he points out is that, because studies on happiness usually include few atheists, they are often lumped in with the &amp;#39;undecideds&amp;#39;.But what his study suggests is that it&amp;#39;s precisely these fence-sitters who are the unhappiest. People who are firm in their convictions - either firmly religious or firmly non-religious - tend to be happier. Here&amp;#39;s how Galen puts it:When we distinguished strong varieties of nonbelief, such as atheism, from weaker nonbelief, a curvilinear relationship emerged (see Shaver, Lenauer, and Sadd). Those nonbelievers most confident in their nonbelief tended to be the most emotionally healthy, relative to the “fence sitters” who reported more negative emotions. Similarly, life satisfaction was lower among the spirituals relative to the other three belief labels. Therefore, having uncertainty regarding one’s religious views appears to be associated with relatively greater emotional instability.Now, the problem with Galen&amp;#39;s study is that it&amp;#39;s not a random sample of nonbelievers. He recruited members of the Center for Inquiry, who by their nature are going to be &amp;#39;joiners&amp;#39; rather than loners.So I took a look at the World Values Survey. This survey took in over 50 countries, and is a random sample of people in those countries. Among a range of questions they asked how happy people were, and how important religion was in their lives.I lumped together all the responses from all the countries to get this chart of happiness by &amp;#39;importance of religion&amp;#39;.Take a look first at the people who are &amp;#39;very happy&amp;#39;. Sure enough, people for whom religion is not at all important are more likely to be very happy than people in the middle (although people who are religious devotees come out top).So it looks like Galen is right!But look at the &amp;#39;Quite happy&amp;#39; line. It&amp;#39;s the mirror image! So being firm in your convictions has the effect of shifting you from being quite happy to very happy. But it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have much effect on people who are unhappy.Now, this is a very top-line analysis. No doubt there are all sorts of demographic reasons that might explain these patterns  (they&amp;#39;re probably linked to gender and social status, for a start).But I think the important take home is that the naive belief that more religion = more happiness needs to be challenged.By the way, the study website is here, but still under construction!_______________________________________________________________________________________This work by Tom Rees is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp;amp; Wales License....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Go me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HD is a nice enough chap, but he does suffer from that peculiarly English affliction of looking at stuff on your screen, or reading things or your desk, or generally giving into the temptation of nosiness in a totally non-malicious but slightly—once you’ve noticed it—disturbing way that people have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talked his gaze kept flicking over my shoulder. Not, as I initially thought, to the riveting Business Requirements Document displayed on my screen but rather out of the window behind me. This, I thought, was odd even for HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I gave in and turned around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Um, sorry,’ HD said, ‘but I see why you chose this desk. There’s a woman getting undressed down there.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed, two floors down, in an office behind the building  Dennis Publishing was a not unshapely figure in a sheer, silver &lt;em&gt;undergarment&lt;/em&gt;. I desperately tried to refocus on HD, who, although not necessarily unpleasant to look at (in a certain light, at least), certainly posed no serious competition to what was going on behind and below me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried, really I did. But after another thirty seconds of talking about stemming and wildcard searches my neck twisted inexorably around and I was rewarded with a vista of bra and panties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty difficult to concentrate after that, so in the interests of propriety (although I’m not quite sure &lt;em&gt;whose&lt;/em&gt;) we moved away from the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slightly more edifying distraction occurred when I took my lunch break. Waiting at the lights on the corner of Cleveland and Howland, I saw a black car with a pole and camera arrangement on the top. Oh ho, I thought, it’s one of those so-called stealth parking council parking spy cars. But as it drew closer I could read the magic runes on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to the cove next to me and shared a manic grin. The car turned right, and we watched it go up &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=51.522126,-0.138986"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;del&gt;Post Office&lt;/del&gt; BT tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that I was grinning like an idiot with an iPhone in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Damn!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pelted up Cleveland Street, and nearly caught up with it, but it turned into Maple Street and appeared to be getting away. Then it slowed to turn into Cleveland Mews, and I managed to snap it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giggling to myself I continued on to Tottenham Court Road to meet my friend, half hoping the car might make a left, and then—no, because there’s the one-way system. Of course, it might turn around I suppose…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it was, stuck at the lights, and I &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rpg7twit/status/3165416208"&gt;twittered&lt;/a&gt; furiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3795498227/" title="IMG_0365 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2587/3795498227_10c233e088.jpg" height="500" alt="IMG_0365" width="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that I’ll appear several times on Google Earth.

It's not really a coherent narrative, because it was more of a gradual erosion than any sudden realization, or even a series of sudden realizations (though there were one or two of those).  Anyway, here goes a whole bunch of rambling...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;It sounds shallow, but the first and perhaps the most significant factor in my move away from theism is that from the time I reached adolescence, I didn't feel any kind of a bond with my fellow Mormons.  I just didn't identify with them:  I was too intellectually curious, I didn't care for conversational taboos, I never enjoyed church even when I was a True Believing Mormon (TBM) and really tried to enjoy it...  Church was boring, long (Mormon sunday services are three hours, folks, not to mention another hour of young men/young women's meetings on Wednesday nights), I didn't like wearing a tie, I hated the music (I still don't care for most choral music), I hated the arbitrary authority afforded to Sunday school teachers and their ilk...  In addition, the few peers inside the church that I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; identify with were all moving away from TBM status during adolescence -- though some of them did come back in adulthood (maybe all but me?  I'm not sure).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, I think if it weren't for my social/aesthetic incompatibility with Mormonism, it's &lt;i&gt;conceivable&lt;/i&gt; I might have stayed a believer my whole life.  Probably I would have ultimately been convinced by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Evidential_problem_of_evil"&gt;evidential problem of evil&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't ever be sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first rational argument against god that I accepted, and I'm &lt;i&gt;sure&lt;/i&gt; I would have had to buy into this one even without the social/aesthetic issues, is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil"&gt;logical problem of evil&lt;/a&gt;.  I mean, this one is painfully obvious once you really think about it.  However, it only disproves the existence of a god that is simultaneously omnipotent and benevolent.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantinga&amp;#39;s_free_will_defense"&gt;Plantinga's free will defense&lt;/a&gt; and similar such apologies are impotent (heh) in justifying a truly omnipotent god, because if this being can do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;, then he could also do things that were logically contradictory, like eliminating evil without eliminating free will.  (I find the more nuanced arguments against the free will defense to be interesting but superfluous... Either god can do anything or he can't.  If he can, then he's malicious.  If he can't, then whether it's logically possible for free will and evil to coexist is irrelevant.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you can be a theist without an omnipotent God, and that's just what I did for awhile.  Well, actually, I was probably at least 40% agnostic by that point, but I felt that it was still possible there was a very powerful, but not quite omnipotent, god.  I even pointed to a passage in the Book of Mormon which I felt justified this belief, though I just searched for it and couldn't find it.  Maybe I just imagined it was there.  heh...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was also around this time -- I think in my sophomore or junior year of high school -- that I reasoned myself something along the lines of Dawkins' &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Boeing_747_gambit"&gt;Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit&lt;/a&gt;.  I think I was expressing some kind of vague doubts about the existence of God to a friend -- one who was not part of the Mormon church, and who, despite his parents being &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahai"&gt;Bahá'í&lt;/a&gt;, I had never before taken for being particularly theistic -- and he suddenly spat, "Where do you think all this came from?  Do you think it just &lt;i&gt;fell&lt;/i&gt; here?"  At that moment, the infinite regress invoked by this line of argumentation suddenly became illuminated, and it became clear that God as a "first cause" was no kind of answer to the "Big Questions" at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least, that's how I remember it now... Perhaps I had been thinking about this for awhile, and his comment only crystallized it in my mind.  Or maybe I'd already figured it all out before, and I only think I figured it out on the spot because the conversation was memorable.  Meh, anyway, it went &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, dismissing the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument"&gt;Cosmological argument&lt;/a&gt;, as I now know to call it, does not &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;prove the existence of god, but it was an important step nonetheless, because it meant the existence of a theistic universe was no more plausible than the existence of an atheistic universe.  Or perhaps to put it more succinctly, I no longer felt that there were any existential advantages to theism.  It could still be true or false, but it didn't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to be true on an existential basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point, although I still didn't really think about myself that way, I was firmly agnostic, leaning towards atheistic.  What really sealed the deal was my increasing realization that the God of Abraham is a total fucking asshole.  I vaguely alluded to this earlier, when I said that if I had somehow enjoyed the social and aesthetic aspects of Mormonism (ick...), the next best hope for my deconversion would have been the evidential problem of evil.  Even when I was trying my hardest to be faithful, the hackneyed aphorism that "God works in mysterious ways" could only be swallowed for so long before it started acting as an emetic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not even so much the existence of suffering that got me, because as I said, I can envision a not-quite-omnipotent God doing his best to be benevolent and yet the best he could do ended up being a rather cruel universe anyway.  No, it is the absurdity of God's alleged commandments that really tears it.  In particular, I found it impossible to accept the juvenile inanity of the sexual restrictions practiced by Mormonism and most other mainstream religions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heh, it's funny to say so, but I bet that whole prohibition on masturbation has deconverted more adolescents than one could ever imagine.  I mean, it's abundantly clear to nearly any 15-year-old that you don't go blind or get hairy palms from excessively wacking it, in't it?  But of course teens can still be made to feel guilty by authority figures.  (I had forgotten until recently how terrible I felt about lying to the Bishop when in a &lt;a href="http://packham.n4m.org/recomm.htm"&gt;temple recommend&lt;/a&gt; interview he asked if I ever "&lt;a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;amp;locale=0&amp;amp;sourceId=a60ea41f6cc20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;amp;vgnextoid=ba805f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD"&gt;abused my body&lt;/a&gt;"... What a creep!)  By the time one gets to be 19 or 20, though, I would think one would have the perspective to realize how silly it is to think you ought to, or even &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;, forbid people from masturbating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homosexuality and premarital sex were also no-brainers.  Any mature adult ought to be able to see that there's nothing inherently wrong with either of those things.   The arguments that seek to attack them on a practical level (e.g. premarital sex leading to teen pregnancy) do nothing but conflate an irresponsible behavior with an unrelated and perfectly innocuous behavior.  Hell, premarital sex isn't just innocuous, it's a damn good idea!  If someday my son tries to marry a woman (or man) who he hasn't been intimate with first, I'm gonna smack that boy upside the head and ask him what the hell he is thinking!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was around this time, in mid-college, that I began half-jokingly referring to myself as a "non-practicing agnostic":  In theory, I believed one could never really know -- but in practice, I could not bring myself to accept even the possibility of the existence of a god.  It was too infuriating.  Hence, the "non-practicing" aspect of my professed agnosticism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As many people do in college, I flirted with some quasi-mystical beliefs, but I never really believed them more than metaphorically.  Actually, ahem, my mystical experiences were pretty much inextricably tied to, uh, erm, certain other "experiences" that people often do "in college".  Enough said about that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I gradually moved away from this "non-practicing agnostic" position towards one that was, at least at a rational level, purely atheistic.  It seemed rather silly to insist on the unknowability of God's existence, when I could make the same argument about the unknowability of, say, my car's existence.  Sure, if you want to go and put too fine a point on it, one can never really say anything exists -- but that's an existential dead end.  It's solipsism, and it's stupid.  (Side note:  For a brief period I referred to myself as a "psuedo-solipsist scientific methodist", but the less said about that awkward construction the better...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while I fully rejected the existence of God on a rational level, there was still a trace that remained on an emotional level.  I used to say, "I don't believe in God, but I also believe He hates me."  I was only half-joking when I said that, too.  I guess on a subconscious level, the stories of my youth still had some influence over me, yet at the same time my adult knowledge of ethics and morality made those stories viscerally revolting.  Or something like that, who knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that takes me all the way until last year, when I saw &lt;i&gt;Religulous&lt;/i&gt; and started being exposed to the writings of Hitchens, Dawkins, etc.  You know, it's always really funny to me when people talk about how the so-called "New Atheists" are so bitter and are "obviously angry at God."  I actually &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; an angry-at-God quasi-atheist for nearly a decade, and what made me &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; angry at God anymore was reading those dudes' books.  I'm not quite sure exactly how to put it, but I guess that it made me view my atheism as not just the inevitable conclusion of a rational mind, but as a distinctly &lt;i&gt;good thing&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, it was more than that even.  It sort of turned my anti-theistic feelings upside down.  Rather than being angry at the idea of God and religion, instead I became passionate about the idea of &lt;i&gt;freedom from&lt;/i&gt; religion.  Don't get me wrong, I still have plenty of righteous indignation (heh) reserved for theism.  But I'm less focused on the badness of what is, and more on the goodness of what could be.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe my blog doesn't always make it seem like that, but given the distrust and vitriol reserved for atheists in this country, I guess it shouldn't be too surprising that even when I'm trying to be positive I end up mostly complaining.  The difference is, somehow, I feel good about it now.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the risk of feeding the "atheism is just another religion" crowd, I guess I could say that being passionate about atheism makes me feel like I'm a part of something larger than myself.  I know a lot of people fulfill that need through religion.  I myself never got that from Mormonism (though you better damn well believe I tried) but even if I had, isn't it better to find fulfillment via something that is actually true?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "New Atheists" are not bitter and angry.  In my opinion, the ones who are the most bitter and angry are fundamentalists, disillusioned theists, and yes, the closeted atheists who know the truth but somehow view that as a negative.  Coming out about one's atheism is a way of &lt;i&gt;letting go&lt;/i&gt; of the damage done by religion.  I only wish more people could see that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-476789178500134656?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1249592842348"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/lies_damned_lies_and_republica.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e38415e5dda93e7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health care reform"/><title type="html">Lies, damned lies, and Republicans</title><published>2009-08-06T18:32:44Z</published><updated>2009-08-06T18:32:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/poeTvxHYVPo/lies_damned_lies_and_republica.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/lies_damned_lies_and_republica.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A short while ago&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/health_care_reform---how_to_ob.php"&gt; I wrote about a fear-mongering piece &lt;/a&gt;in the Wall Street Journal, written by Betsy McCaughey.  It turns out that my imagination was insufficient to comprehend the scope of her audacious mendacity.   &lt;a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/betsy-mccaughey/mccaughey-claims-end-life-counseling-will-be-requi/"&gt;McCaughey is one of the thugs&lt;/a&gt; pushing the lie that the health care reform bill would mandate euthanasia counseling.  Her deceitful comments were picked up by Rush Limbaugh and others, and spread across the wackosphere.  So what did she say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The health care reform bill "would make it mandatory -- absolutely require -- that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing correct about that statement is the spelling.  &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3200/text"&gt;The actual bill&lt;/a&gt; is far less sinister.
